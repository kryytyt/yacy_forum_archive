[Ein Bombeninvestment, so ein
ICO](https://news.bitcoin.com/46-last-years-icos-failed-already/)!

> Trawling through 900 ICOs in one sitting is a deeply depressing

> empty Telegram groups, websites no longer hosted, and communities no
> longer tended are par for the course. A digital graveyard, complete
> with metaphorical tumbleweed, characterizes the crop of 2017 that
> decided to take the money and run. Many raised zero; some raised a
> couple of thousand dollars; and a handful raised over \$10 million. In
> each case, the end result was the same though: no MVP, no alpha
> release, and no contribution to the decentralized web for the
> betterment of humanity.

Schockierend! Hätte uns doch nur jemand warnen können!
