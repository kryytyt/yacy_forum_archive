I am very, very late with this, but hey, [the last few months have left
me a little distracted](https://www.patreon.com/dnalounge). It\'s nearly
the end of January, and I had to face the fact that I\'m just never
going to find the time to do a lot of writing about this, so\... ship
it. As I\'ve said in previous years, I feel that year-end lists like
this aren\'t of much use if the author doesn\'t say something about what
the music is or why they like it, but, well, that\'s not going to happen
this year. Oh well.

So. In only approximate order of favoriteness \-- and for the
*fourteenth* year in a row \-- and since I didn\'t force myself to write
about them, the order and everything else about this is *extremely*
approximate \-- here is my year-end wrap-up. As usual, a few of the
entries on the following list were released earlier than 2016, but that
is when I discovered them, so I\'m allowing some slack. Though most were
actually released in 2016.

This year I acquired around 50% more new music as [last
year](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/12/2015-music-wrap-up-and-mixtape-161/):
roughly 90 new releases, almost all released within the last 3 years,
roughly half released in 2016. That\'s up 17% from
[2014](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/12/2014-music-wrap-up-and-mixtape-147/)
but still down 25% from
[2013](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/12/2013-music-wrap-up-and-mixtape-136/).

Number of those bands that I saw perform this year: 22.\
Number of those bands that performed at DNA Lounge this year: 11.\
