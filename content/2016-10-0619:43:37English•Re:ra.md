It looks like the JVM you installed does not work with your processor
architecture\... Is it a Raspberry version 1, which is ARMv6 according
to
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Processor){.postlink}?\
\
Maybe you can try with the other JVM version provided by Oracle\... Or
with the java package provided with your distribution?\
\
By the way, I think the error is not logged by YaCy because it occurs
too early and the JVM isn\'t even initialized.
