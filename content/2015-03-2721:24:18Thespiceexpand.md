> The patent claims that a mixture can be made which, when applied to
> the eye, will absorb to the retina and act to increase vision in low
> light. The mixture put forth in the patent is a simple combination of
> Ce6 and insulin in saline. It is mentioned in the same, that
> dimethlysulfoxide (DMSO) can be used in place of the insulin. We
> propose a combination of the two could lead to the most noted effects.
> For testing purposes, the mixture from the patent (Ce6, Saline,
> Insulin) was used with the addition of DMSO for increased
> permeability.
