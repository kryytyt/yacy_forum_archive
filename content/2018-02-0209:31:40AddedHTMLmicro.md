Added HTML microdata typed items parsing capability.

This adds the possibility for the HTML parser to gather typed items URLs
annotated in HTML tags with itemscope and itemtype attributes (see
microdata specification https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/ ), notably
Types from the schema.org vocabulary, but also Types/Classes from any
other vocabulary, such as the common ones listed in the RDFa core
context ( https://www.w3.org/2011/rdfa-context/rdfa-1.1.html ).
