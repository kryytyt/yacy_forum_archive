I just tried to run YaCy on Java 8 on my Mac (within the development
environment) and I am surprised to see that YaCy does not work at all;
it constantly generates memory problems.\
What causes that the application wrapper does think that you don\'t have
any java installed is a mystery; I try to find out what it causes.
