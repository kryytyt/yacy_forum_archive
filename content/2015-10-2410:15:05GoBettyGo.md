T-shirts on bands so far have included Pixies, Gilman, *Suspiria* and
Bikinikill, so I was already starting to suspect that we had time warped
to 1992, and then these folks covered Elastica\'s *Stutter* en espa√±ol,
which narrowed that down: we are actually living inside an issue of
*Love and Rockets* right now.
