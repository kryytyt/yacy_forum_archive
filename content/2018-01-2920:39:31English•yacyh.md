English â€¢ yacy https ssl tls letsencrypt
========================================

Date: 2018-01-29 20:39:31

Even all,\
\
Can someone please point me in the direction of how I can:\
\
1) enable yacy to work with free TLS certificates from letsencrypt -
this should be standard in 2018!!\
2) how to disable http and the http ports from being used with any
installation of yacy, so forcing everything to go over https ONLY\
3) how to confirm that NO DATA is sent between my pod and another yacy
pod in http / cleartext and ONLY uses https or TLS to communicate\
4) how to get this forum onto https, again using free certs from
letsencrypt (they\'re free!)\
\
Anyone know any of these answers?\
\
appreciated!
