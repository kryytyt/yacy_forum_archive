Network Bandwidth Guidelines?\

Have you considered a RAM disk to do the initial crawl with scheduled
task to backup contents (Yacy would have to be stopped and started)?\
Do you have any logs lines that say similar HostQueue forcing
crawl-delay of 673 milliseconds for <http://www.zxyyy.net>: minimumDelta
= 250, flux = 0, host.average = 1683 ?\
A lot of sites are protected I think by DDos protection providers this
could be an issue for you.\
What sort of increments do you get on the Traffic (Crawler) counter per
update?\
Did you have over 11 mb/s when cloning from github?\

I have done a few stress tests and java spikes my CPU not sure for the
reason. <https://twitter.com/smokingwheels/status/868477414178865152>\
This one asks for a peak nearly 25 x the power of my CPU, open both pics
you will see the scale the one on the right is the load averages.

Searching was performed over the period.\

You can define you own network and have lots of peers on it doing remote
crawls [I have never tried it]{style="font-weight: bold"}.
