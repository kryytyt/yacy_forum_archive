Apple-opaque sticker printing: the nightmare continues.

[![](http://www.dnalounge.com/store/sticker-anim.gif)](http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2013/03/21.html)I
need a new sticker vendor.

So, remember that time when I [spent literally
*years*](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/12/apple-opaque-sticker-printing-unpossible/)
trying to find someone to manufacture the sticker pictured at right? And
then, finally, we [found
someone](http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2013/03/21.html), and
there was much rejoicing?

Yeah, good times.

Well, guess what. We have A) sold out of all of those stickers, and B)
now that vendor won\'t make them any more.

So I am in search of a new vendor who can do die-cut foil stickers. Two
colors, green and black, as pictured. The white part is a cut-out.

In my experience, this is the only thing that will work. Printing on
paper or vinyl is insufficiently opaque to block out the light of the
Apple logo. It has to be foil.

\"Surely there are plenty of people out there who can die-cut foil!\"
you may be saying. \"I\'ve seen that before!\" you may add.

Well. Here is the list of vendors we\'ve contacted in the last six
months. They\'ve *all* said no. Can you add any suggestions to this
list?
