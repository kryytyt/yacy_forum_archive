[SFMTA \'Leans Toward\' Formalizing Illegal Sunday Double Parking For
Churchgoers](http://sfist.com/2016/08/12/sfmta_leans_toward_formalizing_ille.php)

> The SFMTA is set to decide on Tuesday whether or not to formalize the
> currently illegal practice of churchgoers every Sunday turning the
> Mission\'s Dolores Street into a parking lot. The Examiner reports
> that despite wide community opposition to the practice, officials are
> on the verge of approving a 12-month pilot program that would make the
> practice legit.
>
> \"I suspect we\'d lean toward a pilot,\" chairman of the SFMTA Board
> of Directors Tom Nolan told the paper. If approved Tuesday, the
> program would essentially be an official seal of approval for the
> current state of affairs.
>
> This news is sure to frustrate neighborhood residents, who in a fall
> 2015 survey overwhelming voiced their disapproval of the church double
> parking: 75 percent of survey respondents opposed the current state of
> affairs, and 74 percent of area residents supported completely banning
> median parking on Sundays.
