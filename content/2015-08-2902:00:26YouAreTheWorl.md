> You uplink into a pervert club, one of the many sin joints littered
> across the cybercity. Around you dance netheads, sex downloaders,
> gulch manglers, and all other types of indecent sickos. Freed from the
> constraints of reality, they meet here to engage in their darkest
> desires. It\'s a seedy dive, but a good spot to meet criminal
> employers.
>
> The pervert club\'s waitress glides up and greets you with a
> cheerfully synthetic smile. \"What drink would you like me to shit for
> you?\" she asks.
>
> \"Yes, we\'re all rude perverts here, so shit is a thing we like.
> It\'s the fecal sensation we can\'t get enough of. Everything on the
> menu gets squeezed out of my simulated ass. Do you still want a
> drink?\"
>
> The waitress climbs up onto the bar, squats down, and, with a moan of
> gross pleasure, craps out a piÃ±a colada. You take a sip. It\'s not
> bad.
