``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
added a full solr export to the IndexControlURLs_p.html servlet. The
export function is also now the default export option. The export file
format for a full solr export is very similar to a solr search result
xml, only the  tag is missing.

The exported xml has a special line termination feature: all documents
will be exported into a single line without any CR in between. That
means that every document is completely inside a single line. While this
is not readable at all for humans, it is very useful for linux line
processing scripts, like grep. Using grep it will be easy to select
single documents which match for a given pattern.

Such dumps shall be importable with the DATA/SURROGATE/in import
function, but that import is not yet adopted to the new file format.
