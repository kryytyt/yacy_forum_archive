> There is one of those \"hidden\" perl scripts, kcard\_login.pl, which
> will do the weirdest login procedure EVAR. It retrieves the password
> from the wsd.conf file, and then serves javascript code to the user\'s
> browser which checks the password for validity. Yes, you read right.
> The check is done in javascript!\

> Which means all you have to do to recover the password in plaintext is
> to point your browser to
> http://192.168.11.254/cgi-bin/kcard\_login.pl, and see the page\'s
> source code. The password will be right there.
