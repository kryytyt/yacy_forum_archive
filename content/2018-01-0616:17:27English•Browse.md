English â€¢ Browser for the masses
================================

Date: 2018-01-06 16:17:27

Hello,\
I am new to Yacy, which is such a great project.\
I was wondering if there is a way to design a very user friendly
browser, maybe based on chromium, that would automatically run a Yacy
node in the background and use it as its default search engine.\
This node would crawl every visited website.\
Of course, the private mode would shut it off.\
\
Dooble, even in its new version <https://textbrowser.github.io/dooble/>
does not meet my expectations.\
\
Any ideas ?
