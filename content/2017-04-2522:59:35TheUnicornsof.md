am really loving what Google Translate does to this article:

[Furthroat with a coarse
angle:](http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2017/04/22/furduhrutur_med_samvaxin_horn/)

> Older farmers in the countryside have made a trip to Erla and Bjarni
> to look strangely on the beast with their blinky eyes.
>
> \"This furious bump has been named Einhyrningur. We saw what was
> happening in the sheepfold in the early spring when he came into the
> world, the horns were already gathered and only at the top. They have
> grown then straight up from the head of the ram, so now he looks like
> a monkey. We were really sorry for him when he was in search of
> retirement shortly before Christmas. As a result, he lived for a
> longer life, but most of the lamb shrubs that came into the world at
> the same time last spring, they went to a slaughterhouse this autumn
> afterwards, \"says Erla Þórey Ólafsdóttir, a farmer in Hraunkot in
> Landbrot, but in the cabins Her and Bjarni Bjarnason, her husband,
> find the fantasy creature Einhyrning.
>
> Although Unicorn is so pleasant, unusual as it actually shows, it does
> not make it a living.
>
> \"He can not live unless next fall, the gray. He is not a breeding
> breed, it is clear, he is mostly unclean and does not thrive well
> enough, he likes to be bad. But he is getting his extra summer now,
> \"says Erla, who has not dug up unhappy stories to read for her
> children on the occasion of the furious quake on the farm.
