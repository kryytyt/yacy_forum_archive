Hallo mass,\
\
did you install from dep-Package or something like that?\
\
I\'ve never tested these distro-packages.\
\
\@ALL:\
Does some know the file-structure of the distro-package an can tell mass
here how to get a clean setup?\
\
The \'DATA\'-directory and its subfolders should hold all your index and
settings.\
If installed from tar.gz it is save to delete everything that came from
that archive but hold this DATA-dir.\
\
I hope you\'ll get a more detailed answer here soon.\
\
cu, sixcooler.
