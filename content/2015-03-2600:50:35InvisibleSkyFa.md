> As most of the churches in the city don\'t have adequate parking, the
> congregants have landed on the neat \"solution\" of illegally double
> parking wherever they please. But now, it seems, another group has
> gotten wise to the double-parking game: parkgoers.
>
> This pattern of illegal double parking is particularly bad in the
> Mission, and has been driving neighbors crazy for years. This is
> perhaps best exemplified on Dolores Street, where every Sunday morning
> parked cars line both sides of the street creating a narrow chute for
> cyclists and drivers to share. And while the neighbors complain about
> this illegal practice constantly, the city looks the other way to the
> benefit of the churchgoers.
>
> Things have recently begun to take a turn for the interesting, as what
> few illegal spots there are appear to be getting snatched up by people
> heading to Dolores Park. And the church crowd is not having it.
