![](https://www.jwz.org/images/960.jpg)I\'m glad that the new *Jurrasic
Park* series, by which I mean *Westworld*, jumped right in with
*Galactica* Season 5 levels of dumb to save us all a lot of wasted time.

Here are my predictions:

Rapey Ed Harris discovers the corporate or military conspiracy to
replace people with robots, a la *Dollhouse*.

Enigmatic Hannibal Lecter has secretly given the robots souls. Oh noes.

Tubby Comic Relief Guy learns to be a Real Hero while rescuing his
family, because It\'s All About Family.â„¢

Halfway through, cue the ham-handed softball religious mysticism.
There\'s going to be more God-bothering than nano in this so-called
\"science fiction.\"

At least one scientist is actually a ~~velociraptor~~ robot.

Some of the robots are wait for it\... more human than the humans. *VAT
A TVIST!*

It\'s almost a certainty that, just like in *Humans*, the robots will be
easily partitioned into either \"toaster\" or \"completely human
slave\", and reviewers will scratch their chins and echo a press release
that this \"an exploration on what it means to be human\", when
actually, no, it\'s anything but that. Like [Peter Watts said about
*Humans*](http://www.rifters.com/crawl/?p=6165), which I strongly
suspect will apply here as well: \"What a pleasant 101-level
introduction to AI for anyone who\'s never thought about AI before,
who\'s unlikely to think about AI again, and who doesn\'t like thinking
very hard about much of anything.\"

For a science fiction writer, Michael Crichton seems to really hate
scientists. And science. And science fiction.
