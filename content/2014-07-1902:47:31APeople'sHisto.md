>   [**\@harrisj**](https://twitter.com/harrisj)     What if Mos Eisley wasn\'t really that wretched and it was just Obi Wan being racist again?
>   [](https://twitter.com/harrisj)                  Mos Eisley may not look like much but it\'s a a bedroom community with decent schools and affordable housing.
>   [**\@tcarmody**](https://twitter.com/tcarmody)   You can just imagine Obi-Wan after years of being a Jedi on Coruscant being stuck in this place and just getting madder and madder.
>   [**\@harrisj**](https://twitter.com/harrisj)     yeah nobody cares that the blue milk is so much more artisanal on Coruscant
>   [](https://twitter.com/harrisj)                  I also imagine Tosche Station as some sort of affluent suburban mall where Luke just goes to loiter when bored.
>   [](https://twitter.com/harrisj)                  all I\'m saying is that for a place he allegedly hates, Obi Wan sure knows exactly where the best cantina is
>   [](https://twitter.com/harrisj)                  maybe what Obi Wan really hates is himself for having a good time and enjoying the cantina scene
>   [**\@davin**](https://twitter.com/davin)         Old Sgt. Major Kenobi was this close to muttering \"bloody wogs\" under his breath.
>   [](https://twitter.com/davin)                    Kenobi prefers the obliging company of droids which, long story, accounts in part for the Cantina\'s policy against them.
>   [**\@fhwang**](https://twitter.com/fhwang)       You can\'t be mad at Obi Wan. That\'s just how all the Jedi talked back then.
>   [**\@skottk**](https://twitter.com/skottk)       Face it - Obi-Wan killed Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru in order to let Luke to sell his speeder for funds to leave the planet.
>   [**\@harrisj**](https://twitter.com/harrisj)     and the Greater Mos Eisley Business Improvement District doesn\'t care about the rantings of a separatist hermit
>   [**\@anildash**](https://twitter.com/anildash)   You\'re all talking small potatoes. Big story is Palpatine\'s equity in Sienar Systems.
