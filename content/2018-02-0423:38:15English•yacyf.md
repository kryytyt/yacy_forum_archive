English â€¢ yacy for a indexing a website
=======================================

Date: 2018-02-04 23:38:15

Hi everyone,\
\
I did install and setup yacy to index a wiki. It\'s a dokuwiki, so I
just used a standard crawler where I limited it to the virtual host. The
whole process was straightforward, and the result is actually pretty
good.\
\
I however have a few questions (but I will limit to one for the
moment).\
\
It has been tested by users, and I had feedback about search terms with
mistakes (missing letter, etc) that didn\'t return a reply.\
\
I am not a solr/lucene expert, and I found in solr documentation
IndexBasedSpellChecker that may fit my need.\
\
I had a look at defaults/solr/solrconfig.xml and saw that it wasn\'t
present. Is there a way to set it up ?
