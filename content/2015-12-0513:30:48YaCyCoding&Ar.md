To extend the idea of a modular architecture based on standards, dont\'t
you think integrating Apache Nutch web crawler
(<https://nutch.apache.org/>) Apache Tika parsers
(<https://tika.apache.org/>) would be a good point? Eventual parts of
Yacy crawling or parsing system not already in theses libraries could be
contributed to these projects\... It would allow even more code review
and testing on such core components.
