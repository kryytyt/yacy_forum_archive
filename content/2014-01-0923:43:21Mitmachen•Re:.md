Hi,\
of course, we can also write in English here. translate.google.de is not
the shortest way for communication.

Thanks for making of this contact, Yududi! Regards to q5sys!\
\
When I shut down YaCy on RasPi, my Raspi shows only about 36kByte in RAM
inclusive Swap file. Not more. But without WLAN.\
\
State: Both RasPis doesn\'t work stable current (since 2 days). But I
had no time to check the log\'s. Maybe the next days.\
\
Both RasPis worked without crawling. Only DHT-Transfer. And I saw the
last days that no more so much moving of URLs and words takes place. The
correct numbers of URLs and Words will come the next days, when I have
time to evaluate the current state.\
\
Maybe some fine tuning is possible. But I can not real estimate the
effects of the many parameters. The main problem seems the 100% load of
the processor. I tried to reduce this by increasing the two DHT-times
(20\_dhtdistribution\_busysleep and 20\_dhtdistribution\_idlesleep) by
factor 10. Only, in order to see if this has some effects in load. But
no.\
\
Maybe Orbiter has some suggestions for such tuning points.\
\
We could think about to share the tasks to more than one RasPi. Solr
with the first one. YaCy crawling with the second one. Searching by the
third\... It\'s really an academic test. Since only 2 RasPis has about
the costs of one CubieTruck. And this CubieTruck would have a SATA2
Interface. But this academic test with RasPi is despite interesting. It
could be that we come into the same problems by using of a CubieTruck or
similar boards. Only later. And later means that the tests for this
would need much more time. I think, when we know how we have to tune
YaCy on RasPi, so it will work with all kind of ARM boards.\
\
And yes, of course, we can also take my RasPi\'s or the CubieTruck for
some tests of other images. But I know too less of the inner part of
YaCy to can evaluate the software deep enough.
