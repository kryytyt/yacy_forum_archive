Patch:](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09665.pdf)

> These adversarial patches can be printed, added to any scene,
> photographed, and presented to image classifiers; even when the
> patches are small, they cause the classifiers to ignore the other
> items in the scene and report a chosen target class.
>
> We present a method to create universal, robust, targeted adversarial
> image patches in the real world. The patches are universal because
> they can be used to attack any scene, robust because they work under a
> wide variety of transformations, and targeted because they can cause a
> classifier to output any target class.
