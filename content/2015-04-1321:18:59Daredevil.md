![](http://www.jwz.org/images/250px-daredevil-televison.jpg)I\'m only up
to episode 7, but wow, *Daredevil* is amazingly good! And it has some of
the best fights I\'ve ever seen on TV.

Fisk is perfect! Stick is perfect! Foggy is just the right level of
goofball.

That hallway fight, with the six minute tracking shot!

First they do a slow build, down the hall once, peeking in the rooms to
establish the space; then fight after fight, some of them off screen,
which is fine because we already know the rooms; and the whole time the
camera just stays out of the way! Then it ends as slowly as it began,
and we never actually get to see into the *Bad Room* at the end of the
hall. I backed up and watched that scene twice. You *never* see that
combination of physical badassery and cinematic *restraint.* I haven\'t
seen fight cinematography that good since
