For the first few songs I felt I was seeing Danielle Dax, except she was
a blonde in a football jersey instead of the gothiest goth that ever
gothed a goth. Then her guitarist rolled through his impressions of
Robert Smith and Durruti Column, and she took a regrettable \"adult
contemporary\" turn before passing through Mazzy Star and Sin√©ad into
the inevitable Kate Bush, and I\'m left confused about what decade this
is again? Anyway, good show.
