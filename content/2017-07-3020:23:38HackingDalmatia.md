> Ishee, a member of what\'s called the \"biohacker\" movement, says he

> genes of Dalmatians. By repairing a single DNA letter in their
> genomes, Ishee believes, he can rid them of an inherited disease,
> hyperuricemia, that\'s almost as closely associated with the breed as
> their white coats and black spots. \[\...\]

> Humans have been shaping the DNA of dogs for millennia. But the
> breeding efforts that produced the Dalmatian\'s spots, or the pug\'s
> flat snout, have also led to serious health problems. Certain prized
> bulldogs can\'t even give birth without human assistance. \"Dogs have
> more genetic diseases than any other species on the planet,\" says

> The new rules have larger companies concerned, too. Last December, a
> Minnesota biotechnology startup called Recombinetics fired off a
> letter to the FDA saying that it planned to start selling Holstein
> milk cows that it had genetically edited so that they wouldn\'t
> develop horns. But now Recombinetics\'s sizable investments are in
> doubt. Scott Fahrenkrug, the company\'s founder, says he is ready to
> fight what he thinks are irrational rules.
