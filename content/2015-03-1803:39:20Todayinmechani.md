[Shylight:](http://www.studiodrift.com/work/shylight)

> Shylight unfolds by a system of springs, creating the form once out of
> the cocoon. Gravity lets it slight down and a motor controls the
> upward movement. The silk shade consists of many layers kept apart by
> the polished RVS.

[Jennifer Townley: Bussola, Asinas](http://www.jennifertownley.com/)

> They consist of four hinged parts, converting a vertical movement at
> the bottom hinge into a horizontal movement on the two upper legs.
> Driven by a camshaft all the elements move, each with a small phase
> shift, in the same way. Creating a repetitive yet organic motion of
> the whole. The skeleton-like structure seems to behave like a natural
> organism that slowly moves forward through space.
