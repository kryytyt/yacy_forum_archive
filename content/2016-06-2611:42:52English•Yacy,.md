English â€¢ Yacy, Installation help for Mac
=========================================

Date: 2016-06-26 11:42:52

Hey there, I downloaded Yacy but whenever I started it, the message [to
use the \"java\" command-line tool you need to install a
JDK]{style="text-decoration: underline"} popped up.\
\
So I installed the java from the official apple website\
<https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US>\
\
The message disappeared, and when I clicked on the app, nothing
happened. It\'s just there, on the desktop. And I can\'t access
localhost 8090.\
\
I\'m using google chrome, but i tried this on safari too, and the
localhost page still doesn\'t load\
\
could you please help me out?
