Hello,\
I also agree with jerk, YaCy can not predict itself the end of a crawl
task because it depends on the links found in the crawled pages\...
unknown before crawling. But maybe an approximation could be calculated
when re-crawling a known website\...\
\
By the way, I believe that currently the best estimation will come from
your knowledge of the website content, the \"Crawling Depth\" and
eventual URLs filters you used, and the monitored \"Crawler PPM\" value
on the first hours.\
\
If your crawl appears to be too long for you, maybe some of your crawl
parameters should be re-adjusted.
