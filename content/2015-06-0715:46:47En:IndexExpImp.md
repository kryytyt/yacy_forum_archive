== Index ex- and import ==\
\
Since the development version 1.83 build 9250, YaCy has now the long
awaited feature to handle the index data in a more convenient way: An
ex- and import feature has been implemented.\
\
It is no longer necessary to study complicated manuals for the merge of
two solr indexes and/or setup an additional stand-alone instance for
index merging tasks - thanks to the great work of Orbiter - YaCy
delivers a powerful ex- and import feature out-of-the-box!\
\
How to do that? Here\'s a short tutorial:\

\
1. On the machine you want to export the index data open a browser and
navigate to\
http://localhost:8090/IndexExport\_p.html\
\
Leave the settings as is, XML (Rich and full-text Solr data, one
document per line in one large xml file, can be processed with shell
tools, can be imported with DATA/SURROGATE/in/) because it\'s the best
choice for your index consistency.\
\
2. Press the \'Export URLs\'-Button and grab some coffee :-)\

\
3. On the machine you want to import the index data, simply put the
exported XML file into the following subdirectory of YaCy:
\\DATA\\SURROGATES\\in\
\
You can do this during YaCy is running - you don\'t need to shut it down
first!\
\
4. Voilà - The import process is blazing fast, even on older machines.
After the import process is completed, you can search trough the data
instantly - reindexing is not neccessary.
