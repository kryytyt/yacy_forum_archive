[Schöne Guardian-Kolumne über das Versagen des Kapitalismus und der
Demokratie](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/11/business-rules-lobbying-corporate-interests).
Im Wesentlichen eine Liste von Fällen aus der letzten Zeit, in denen das
System komplett versagt hat. Beispiel:

> On Monday, for instance, the Guardian revealed that the government\'s
> subsidy system for gas-burning power stations is being designed by an
> executive from the Dublin-based company ESB International, who has
> been seconded into the Department of Energy. What does ESB do? Oh, it
> builds gas-burning power stations.

Und der Hammer?

> Thanks to an initiative by Lord Green, large companies have
> ministerial \"buddies\", who have to meet them when the companies
> request it. There were 698 of these meetings during the first 18
> months of the scheme, called by corporations these ministers are
> supposed be regulating. Lord Green, by the way, is currently a
> government trade minister. Before that he was chairman of HSBC,
> presiding over the bank while it laundered vast amounts of money
> stashed by Mexican drugs barons. Ministers, lobbyists -- can you tell
> them apart?

Das stinkt alles so dermaßen, da verliert man jede Hoffnung auf
Besserung.
