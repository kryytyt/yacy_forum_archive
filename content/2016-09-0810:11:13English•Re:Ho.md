Hello, you can for example test on your peer the search API
(/yacy/search.html) used by YaCy peers to perform p2p searches. There
are some examples in the wiki :
[Dev:APIsearch\#Example\_Usage](http://www.yacy-websearch.net/wiki/index.php/Dev:APIsearch#Example_Usage){.postlink}.
Supposing your local index contains one of the sample search terms, the
query sould return results encoded (hashes) results. So remote peers
should be able to use them.\
\
You can also check your solr API (/solr/select) is correctly working.
There is also a sample query in the wiki :
[Dev:APISolrSelect](http://www.yacy-websearch.net/wiki/index.php/Dev:APISolrSelect){.postlink}.\
\
And of course your peer Status should be \"Senior\" but I guess you
already checked that.\
You should also check in (/ConfigNetwork\_p.html) that \"Index
Distribution\" is enabled. This is what controls the automated index
distribution, notably through /yacy/transferRWI.html API.
