[The infinity puzzles are a new type of jigsaw puzzle inspired by
topological spaces that continuously tile. Because of that, they have no
fixed shape, no starting point, and no
edges.](http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/?p=7613)

> The intricate branching shapes of our puzzle pieces emerge from a
> simulation of crystal growth and are lasercut from plywood. \[\...\]
> Instead of mapping to a torus, this puzzle maps to a Klein bottle, an
> impossible 3D shape where the inside and outside are mathematically
> indistinguishable. This means that the puzzle tiles with a flip.
> Pieces from the right side attach to the left side but only after they
> have been flipped over. Just like the Klein bottle\'s surface has no
> inside or outside, the puzzle has no up or down side. You can start
> the puzzle anywhere on any side. This puzzle is adorned with a
> photograph of the galactic center from the Hubble observatory. The
> image is continuous from one side of the puzzle to the other, so it\'s
> not possible to see the entire image at once. Explore the galaxy while
> assembling the puzzle in multiple ways.
