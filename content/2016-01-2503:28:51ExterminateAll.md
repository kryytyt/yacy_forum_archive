[Fantom:](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/massive-attacks-new-app-generates-unique-remixes-based-on-your-environment)

> [The app, described as a \"sensory music
> player,\"](http://www.thefantom.co/) provides us with four new Massive
> Attack tracks. Each is a totally unique remix for every user, created
> by an algorithm in the app that collates data from sensors in your
> phone to create one-off remixes you can then record and share.
>
> \"Why would we put a premixed album out when there\'s algorithms
> that\'ll mix this for you?\"
>
> The limitless potential of a project like this seems to fuel Del
> Naja\'s creativity. \"I keep thinking about what we could do next; for
> example, if you aggregated the personal data of everyone at a concert
> who had the app then you might be able to remix the music we\'re
> playing in real-time,\" he imagines. \"So you could create a sort of
> group sensory experience. It changes the way you think about
> performance, because while one might see apps like this as an escapist
> experience, it might be more pervasive. I think there\'s potential for
> it to affect the way we go out and how we share music with the people
> around us.\"
>
> To create the experience, Thomas and Del Naja used studio masters of
> the new Massive Attack tracks and broke them down into minimalist
> fragments. In the app, these tracks evolve in accordance with personal
> and environmental factors picked up from the user\'s movement, camera
> images, times of day and location \-- as well as biometric signals
> such as your heartbeat \-- in the iPhone and Apple Watch. \"I think
> people understand now that devices can use a lot of our personal data
> for useless stuff like targeted advertising,\" says Thomas. \"But what
> we\'re producing is almost the complete opposite of that. It takes
> your data and creates a really great experience for you, without
> storing it or trying to sell you something. It\'s creation in the
> moment and a logical avenue for artists to explore.\"
>
> According to Thomas, it\'s all about striking a balance between
> \"nonlinear\" composition and the formality of conventional music. \"I
> think the mistake that people make when they think about this kind of
> work is that it\'s all randomly thrown together, but the way to make
> this stuff well is to build rules into the system,\" he says. \"We
> have to make sure it makes sense melodically: so a piece from the
> chorus will never appear alongside a verse, which means the behavior
> of the system can change, but it will always change in a musical
> way.\"
>
> \"We have to make sure it\'s rewarding for the user and interesting
> artistically, never working against the musical intentions of the
> material.\"
>
> Thomas is cautious about how the musical interaction with the user
> happens. \"It\'s very curatorial\" he tells me. \"We have to make sure
> it\'s rewarding for the user and interesting artistically, never
> working against the musical intentions of the material. But in the
> future we\'re looking towards AI taking over some aspects of that
> curation, so it would be possible for a meta-reworking, where multiple
> remixes are possible.\"

This thing is really cool. Also
