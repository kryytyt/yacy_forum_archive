So a few years back we\'re walking down the street and there are these
9-year-old girls with ukuleles playing *Brand New Key*, and I say,
\"That\'s a pretty dirty song for those kids to be singing.\" My friend
says, \"What are you talking about, that is a completely innocent
song.\" Then later that night we see The Dollyrots, and they play it
too, and my friend says, \"Ok, you\'re right, that song is dirty as
hell.\"
