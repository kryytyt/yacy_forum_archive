> During the first and second weeks of the ritual, sacrificial amounts
> are placed in special, once a day blocks. These blocks are a reward to
> the worshipper for sacrifice made. During the third and fourth weeks
> of the ritual the rewards build, small at first, then larger as the
> worship increases with fervor. During the last five days, the
> \'Tharanak shagg,\' or \"promise of dreamland,\" the ritual reaches
> final pitch and the daily special blocks are highly increased. Finally
> Cthulhu will return after the xx665th offering has paid tribute to the
> Great Old One and he will bestow a bounty deserving of Him upon one
> lucky worshiper. The ritual can be repeated after six months time,
> following the great halving.
