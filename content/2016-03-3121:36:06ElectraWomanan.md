Electra Woman and Dyna Girl
===========================

Hopefully you are familiar with the unaired pilot for a remake of the
Krofft Super Show\'s *Electra Woman and Dyna Girl* \-- one of the filler
shows that was [*not quite as good*]{.underline} as *Land of the Lost*
or *Sigmund the Sea Monster*. If you haven\'t watched this, you are in
for a rare treat. Stick with it until you get to the alcoholic Electra
Woman living in a trailer park. Just let the magic wash over you\...

\...because that\'s the point at which you realize that this is Markie
Post from *Night Court* in her breakout dramatic role!

It\'s basically an unused flashback scene from the *Watchmen* movie,
right?

And you\'re thinking, wow, they made some shitty tv in 1985 (with a
\$100 budget.). Nope. That was made in 2001.

So then *this* happened. Yup, they\'re taking another swing at this one.
They\'re gonna put a shine on this turd or die trying! We\'ve seen how
the Kroffts do \"grim and gritty\" \-- so now we\'re going to get to see
how they do lesbians!

Still, even the 2001 version looks *way* better than *Arrow*.
