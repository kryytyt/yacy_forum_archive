English â€¢ Translation (suggestion for the developers)
=====================================================

Date: 2015-02-10 18:56:57

Hello all,\
\
I\'m translating YaCy to Portuguese (pt) and it\'s harder then it should
be.\
I\'ve already made translations for other software, namely Manjaro Linux
components (Octopi, pacman, etc) and it\'s [much
easier]{style="font-weight: bold"}.\
The use of .po language files instead of .lng makes a great difference,
namely because if you use a site like Transifex a large number\
of users can co-operate in the translation of the same file.\
In the current situation no one is aware of what others are doing. Do
you know how many of us are trying at the same time to\
translate the .lng file into the same language?\
I may be translating something that was already translated by someone
else and that\'s a waste of time for all involved.\
Transifex is a great solution because each language may be assigned to a
mantainer and as many translators as necessary and\
all in a coherent way.\
YaCy being a Web search engine makes all sense to translate it into
every possible language and in my humble opinion as fast\
as possible so users have another alternative to Google (I use Duck Duck
Go).\
I don\'t know if it\'s possible to use ,po files with your code but it
would be great if you could follow that approach.\
I bet you would be astonished how fast YaCy would be translated to every
available language worldwide.\
\
I thank the developers for sharing with us all the result of their
effort and hard work.\
\
Best regards,\
arcorreia\

PS - I suggested .po because I can\'t find .lng in the list of formats
supported by Transifex <http://docs.transifex.com/developer/formats/>\
There is also an opensource and free (projects must pay Transifex, it\'s
free only for translators) alternative that seems very promising
