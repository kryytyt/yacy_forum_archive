> The new app, RatsEyes, gives driving directions to your destination
> while also shouting knowledge gained from the relentless work ethic of
> Rollins\' legendary hardcore group, Black Flag. The band\'s
> groundbreaking and hard touring schedule often took them on very
> nontraditional routes across the country, as the app will frequently
> remind you.
>
> While trying to drive from Los Angeles to Tucson, one user was
> directed to \"Drive five miles to 7-11. Locate the nearest payphone
> and call Steve. Hopefully he\'ll pick up and let you know where you
> need to be. Otherwise it\'s just another overnight with Watt arguing
> about whatever bullshit he\'s got up his ass this time.\"
>
> Noticeably absent from the app is a mute feature; any attempt to
> silence the app only makes the Rollins narration more irritated. Also,
> RatsEyes features long-winded talks from the former Black Flag
> frontman that can extend up to 20 minutes after you arrive at your
> destination. Some users with Wifi-enabled cars have reported a glitch
> where the car locks until the stories are over.
>
> \"I initially downloaded the app because I am a Rollins fan and the
> price was right,\" said Amy Fuller. \"But I ended up almost running
> out of gas because the app just told a 30-minute story about fighting
> skinheads at a nearby all ages venue that closed down in 1993.\"
