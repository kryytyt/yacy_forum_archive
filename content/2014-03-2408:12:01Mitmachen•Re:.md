Hi q5sys,\
\
- the login issue is fixed as far as I can see!\
- Including a USB drive is a good decision!\
- upgrading YaCy: all data is always inside of DATA but it should not be
necessary to save it as the internal upgrade-process does not do that as
well: we always copy the latest release over the old release; the
automatically deployed update script just removes the old libraries
before starting with the update.\
What should be better is a combined OS/YaCy release update process.
