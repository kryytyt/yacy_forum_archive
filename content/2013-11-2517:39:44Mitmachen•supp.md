operators of the battleground-embedded YaCy peer are looking for YaCy
developer support for the purpose to harden YaCy in rough environments.
Marius, the current maintainer of the \'Googu\' (YaCy) search wrote me:\

Marius asks me to support the search plattform there:\

..but I rejected since this would eat up too much time which I currently
need for development and documentation in advance of the 30C3 which will
bring \'nice\' things for YaCy (this will be really nice!).\
\
So here is my question to everyone: who wants to take over maintenance
of Marius\' CTF365 YaCy and hold the YaCy flag on a YaCy team fortress
there? I will send Marius a link to this posting so you can get in
direct contact.
