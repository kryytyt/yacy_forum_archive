Hi,\
\
would like to use this thread to collect all your ideas on:\
\"How to beat Google?\"\
\
Surely not physical but the quality of a search result.\
YaCy is a P2P search engine that causes some limitations and the results
of a search could still be improved.\
\
I don\'t care if your ideas sounds crazy for yourself or not.\
Think about it and share your ideas here.\
\
Regards
