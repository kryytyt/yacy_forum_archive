In only approximate order of favoriteness \-- and for the *thirteenth*
year in a row \-- here is my year-end wrap-up. As usual, a few of the
entries on the following list were released earlier than 2015, but that
is when I discovered them, so I\'m allowing some slack. Though most were
actually released in 2015.

This year I acquired around 80% as much new music as [last
year](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/12/2014-music-wrap-up-and-mixtape-147/):
roughly 60 new releases, almost all released within the last 3 years,
more than half released in 2015. That\'s down 50% from
[2013](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/12/2013-music-wrap-up-and-mixtape-136/).

Number of those bands that I saw perform this year: 15.\
Number of those bands that performed at DNA Lounge this year: 5.\
Go Team. Both of those numbers are down too.

So I am officially in a rut.

I haven\'t commented on all of these because I still find it *really
hard*. Don\'t hold it against them. Listen to the mixtape!

I like these things. You should like them too. Here\'s your shopping
list:

-   **[Veruca Salt](http://www.verucasalt.com/) - \"Ghost Notes\"**

    This album sounds like they could have made it in 1998 \-- which is
    totally fine by me. It\'s really, really great: *Triage* and *The
    Museum of Broken Relationships* are as good as anything they\'ve
    ever done. In case you haven\'t heard, this is the band\'s original
    lineup, producer and all. They broke up in 1998, and Louise released
    two and a half albums on her own, but now everybody\'s happy so they
    can get back to writing angry songs about miserable relationships!

    I think it\'s kind of weird that most of the reviews I\'ve read of
    it have pretty much pretended that Louise\'s \"solo\" Veruca Salt
    albums don\'t even exist. I think *Resolver* is very nearly as good
    an album as *Eight Arms To Hold You* was \-- I love every track. And
    the later releases were also pretty good: maybe not up to that
    standard as whole albums, but they contained some great stuff:
    *Damage Done*, *Officially Dead*, *Closer*, *Save You*\...

-   **[Meg Myers](http://www.megmyers.com/) - \"Sorry\"**

    More angry songs about terrible relationships! Yay!

-   **[Chvrches](http://www.chvrch.es/) - \"Every Open Eye\"**

    I\'d say that overall the tracks on this album are consistently
    better than on *The Bones of What You Believe*, but that one had
    some better stand-out tracks. By the way, if you haven\'t heard
    their covers of *I Would Die 4 V* and *Bela Lugosi\'s Dead*, you
    really should.

-   **[Health](http://www.youwillloveeachother.com/) - \"Death Magic\"**

    This album has a very unusual style: the music is *heavy as fuck*,
    sometimes sounding a bit metal, sometimes a bit industrial, but just
    *so heavy*, and then the vocals come in and he\'s singing in this
    airy synthpoppy style. It sounds like that would be a complete mess,
    but it\'s not! Also this was probably the second best show I saw all
    year \-- and they only came in second to Lydia Lunch, and she\'s
    hard to top.

-   **[Metric](http://www.ilovemetric.com/) - \"Pagans in Vegas\"**

    This is a really good album, but I keep wanting them to release
    *Fantasies* again\... and it\'s not quite *Fantasies*. But, I felt
    the same way about *Synthetica* too, and that grew on me eventually.

-   **[Vanbot](http://www.vanbotmusic.com/) - \"Perfect Storm\"**

    This album makes me feel sad, and cold, and sad. Ok, I\'m really
    cold right now. But that\'s not why.

-   **[The Chemical Brothers](http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/) -
    \"Born in The Echoes\"**

    Better than *Further*, definitely, but they are kind of repeating
    themselves. *Go* is probably the best track, and its awesome, but
    it\'s basically the same as *Galvanize* (which to me I will always
    hear as the *Galvanize the Empire* mash-up, dammit). *Taste of
    Honey* could be a Recoil song.

-   **[Shriekback](http://www.shriekback.com/) - \"Without Real String
    or Fish\"**

    The first Shriekback album in five years! Three quarters of the
    original lineup. It\'s definitely a return to their 80s form, much
    more in the *Oil and Gold* vein than *Sacred City* or *Naked Apes*.
    Of the recent albums, I would still rate *Glory Bumps* slightly
    above this, but it\'s very good. I got the [special edition that
    came with a 3d-printed fish and little bits of
    string.](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/03/without-real-string-or-fish/)
    Their merch game is very strong.

-   **[Happy Fangs](http://www.happyfangsmusic.com/) - \"Capricorn\"**

    *\"Excuse me Sir, do you have a minute to talk about rock and
    roll?\"* They are awesome, and I\'m glad we have booked them as
    often as we have. Though it has been a while.

-   **[Fight Like Apes](http://www.fightlikeapesmusic.com/) - \"Fight
    Like Apes\"**

    Even though it\'s self-titled, it\'s their third or fourth album,
    depending on how you count. It\'s great, though not as funny as
    previous releases. But it\'s hard to top song titles like
    *Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues*, *Come On Let\'s Talk About Our
    Feelings*, *Pull Off Your Arms and Let\'s Play In Your Blood* (from
    *\"The Body of Christ and the Legs of Tina Turner\"*).

-   **[Five Knives](http://www.fiveknivesmusic.com/) - \"Savages\"**

    Like I said when reviewing their first album, this band is what
    Shiny Toy Guns should have been but weren\'t. Their lyrics are like,
    the *brattiest* stuff I\'ve ever heard.

-   **[Wolf Alice](http://wolfalice.co.uk/) - \"My Love Is Cool\"**

    A little shoegazey, a little grungey. Bellly meets L7?

-   **[Public Service
    Broadcasting](http://www.publicservicebroadcasting.net/) - \"The
    Race For Space\"**

    All of their albums are built around newsreels and old radio
    broadcasts. This one is about the space race, obviously. The songs
    are not as gimicky as that sounds.

-   **[Meet Me In Orbit](http://www.meetmeinorbit.com/) -
    \"Traveller\"**

    Synthy, mostly instrumental, and possibly from the
    [19A0s](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2012/10/19a0/).

-   **[Jesika von Rabbit](http://www.jesikavonrabbit.com/) - \"Journey
    Mitchell\"**

    A more electronic album by the singer of Gram Rabbit, a longtime
    favorite. It\'s goofy. She\'s a wonderful goofball.

-   **[Speedy Ortiz](http://www.speedyortiz.com/) - \"Foil Deer\"**

    This sounds so much like if Liz Phair made records that I actually
    like! Wait, that didn\'t come out quite right. No, actually, it did.
    The Phair is strong in this one, but better. *\"Sorry I made out
    with your friends. I\'m not that sorry, I\'m never that sorry.\"*

-   **[Barry Andrews](http://www.shriekback.com/) - \"Haunted Box of
    Switches, Vol. 2\"**

    The singer of Shriekback does his \"crooning with a piano\" bit.
    Volume 1 was superior, but this makes a good counterpoint to that
    copy of *\"Without Real String or Fish\"* you were gonna pick up.

-   **[Say Hi](http://www.sayhitoyourmom.com/) - \"Bleeder\'s Digest\"**

    More sad songs about vampires! That\'s right, it\'s the sequel to
    *Impeccable Blahs*.

-   **[Sleep Thieves](http://www.sleepthieves.net/) - \"You Want The
    Night\"**
-   **[Priest](http://www.priestofficial.com/) - \"Priest\"**
-   **[Ume](http://www.umemusic.com/) - \"Too Big World\"**
-   **[Vela Eyes](http://www.velaeyes.com/) - \"Sparks\"**
-   **[2:54](http://twofiftyfour.tumblr.com/) - \"The Other I\"**
-   **[Voltaire Twins](https://voltairetwins.bandcamp.com/) - \"Milky
    Waves\"**
-   **[Sleater-Kinney](http://www.sleater-kinney.com/) - \"No Cities To
    Love\"**

    If you were looking for an album that sounds exactly like a
    Sleater-Kinney album, this is that.

-   **[Chromatics](https://www.facebook.com/chromaticsband/) - \"Running
    From The Sun\"**

    If you were looking for an album that sounds exactly like a
    Chromatics album\...

-   **[Purity Ring](http://www.purityringthing.com/) - \"Another
    Eternity\"**

    If you were\...
