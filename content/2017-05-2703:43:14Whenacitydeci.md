When a city decides your business is toxic to their community, buy off the state legislature to overrule them.

> Uber and Lyft will relaunch services in Austin on Monday, now that
> Texas lawmakers have passed a bill overriding local regulations on
> ride-hailing companies. \[\...\]
>
> Uber and Lyft left Austin after the Austin City Council passed an
> ordinance in December 2015 requiring ride-hailing companies to perform
> fingerprint background checks on drivers, a stipulation that already
> applies to Austin taxi companies.
>
> Uber and Lyft fiercely opposed the rules, gathering petition
> signatures to force a public vote and spending nearly \$9 million on
> an unsuccessful campaign asking voters to overturn the regulations.
> Following the vote, both companies halted services in Austin, and the
> resulting ride-hailing vacuum attracted several start-up ride-hailing
> apps that agreed to comply with the city\'s rules. \[\...\]
>
> Following the passage of the bill in both chambers, Austin Mayor Steve
> Adler issued a statement saying he was \"disappointed\" the
> Legislature voted to nullify regulations the city had implemented.
>
> \"Our city should be proud of how we filled the gap created when Uber
> and Lyft left, and we now must hope that they return ready to compete
> in a way that reflects Austin\'s values,\" Adler wrote.
