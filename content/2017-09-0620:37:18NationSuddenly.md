> NEW YORK \-- Following Hurricane Sandy\'s destructive tear through the
> Northeast this week, the nation\'s 300 million citizens looked upon
> the trail of devastation and fully realized, for the first time, that
> this is just going to be something that happens from now on.

> Gradually comprehending that this sort of thing is now just a fact of
> life, citizens all across America stared blankly at images of
> destroyed homes, major cities paralyzed by flooding, and ravaged
> communities covered in debris, and finally acknowledged that this,
> apparently, is now a regular part of the human experience.

> \"Oh, I see \-- this is just going to be how it is from here on out,\"
> said New York City resident Brian Marcello, coming to terms with the
> fact that an immense storm that cripples mass transit systems and
> knocks out power for millions in the nation\'s largest metropolitan
> area can no longer be regarded as an isolated, freak incident, and
> will henceforth be just a normal thing that happens. \"Hugely
> destructive weather events are going to keep happening, and they are
> going to get worse and worse, and living through them is something
> that will be a part of all our lives from now on, whether we like it
> or not.\" \[\...\]

> A Reuters poll conducted earlier this week found that 43 percent of

> possibility of their entire life being washed away in an instant now
> existed. \[\...\]

> \"I went through something very similar a few years ago when I finally

> I said about global warming,\" Morales added. \"And that it is
> entirely too late to do anything about it.\"
