[Im Iran sind die Reformer deutlich wiedergewählt
worden](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/reformists-sweep-tehran-municipal-vote-as-rouhani-wins-iran/2017/05/22/96cb3a14-3eaf-11e7-b29f-f40ffced2ddb_story.html).

> Candidates backing reform of Iran's clerically overseen government
> swept municipal elections in Tehran, **taking all 21 local council
> seats in the country's capital** while moderate President Hassan
> Rouhani won a second term in office, authorities said on Monday.

Und zur Einordnung, wie bemerkenswert das ist:

> Their win in Friday's election marks **the first time reformists have
> gained total control of Tehran's municipal council** since such votes
> began in the Islamic Republic in 1999. Iranian media also reported
> similar big gains for reformists in other major cities.
