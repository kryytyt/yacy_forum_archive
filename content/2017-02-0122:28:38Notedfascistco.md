(I assume \"part-time partner\" outranks \"board member\" in whatever
system of heraldry these people use.)

As you may recall, [Mass Deportations will make Peter Thiel even
richer](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/12/mass-deportations-will-make-peter-thiel-even-richer/),
since he is following the script of Thomas J. Watson\'s and IBM\'s
collaboration with the Third Reich.

Thiel\'s investment company, Y Combinator, has [refused to sever ties
with
him](http://www.recode.net/2016/10/16/13302120/y-combinator-sam-altman-peter-thiel-donald-trump)
because they don\'t want \"politics\' (and by \"politics\" we mean
\"basic human rights\" and \"ethics\") to in any way impede their
ability to make money.

ACLU has so far been [not really a fan of mass
deportations](https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/here-aclus-7-point-plan-action-take-trump-administration),
but this is standard espionage tradecraft: one great way to get inside
the enemy\'s decision-making process is to *control their money*. Hmm,
is there [someone else that could apply
to?](http://time.com/4433880/donald-trump-ties-to-russia/)
