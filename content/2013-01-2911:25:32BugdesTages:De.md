[Bug des Tages](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5642):

> Description: The iOS kernel has checks to validate that the user-mode
> pointer and length passed to the copyin and copyout functions would
> not result in a user-mode process being able to directly access kernel
> memory. The checks were not being used if the length was smaller than
> one page. This issue was addressed through additional validation of
> the arguments to copyin and copyout.

OH DIE SCHMERZEN!
