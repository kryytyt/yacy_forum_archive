Lyft spam: I hate you, Milkman Facebook
=======================================

![](https://www.jwz.org/images/become-a-fan.png)New morning ritual:

-   Look at all of our events and find the Lyft spam comments. It\'s
    always Lyft. It\'s only Lyft.
-   Go through the 7+ clicks it takes to delete each of them and block
    the fake account that posted it.

-   Click on every account that clicked \"Like\" on it, and go through
    the 4+ clicks to report them as fake accounts. (They are usually in
    Wisconsin for some reason).

-   Wonder, again, why about 1/3 of the time I have a \"report as spam\"
    option on the comment on the event, but the rest of the time I only
    have a \"delete and block\" option.

-   Wonder, again, why FB doesn\'t give me the option of being emailed
    when someone posts a new comment to my events, so that these fuckers
    might get less than 24 hours worth of eyeballs on them before my
    next round of whack-a-mole.

-   Shake an angry fist toward Menlo Park.
