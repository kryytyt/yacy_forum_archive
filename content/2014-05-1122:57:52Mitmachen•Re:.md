The machine has currently an uptime of YaCy of about 28 days.\
A local search takes about less than 6 sec. to finish loading of
yacysearch.html.\

While thats sounds quite nice, I\'ve also to say that processing theses
huge Images diplaying the freeworld (eg. Network.html) cause YaCy to
crash with OOM on my Pi.
