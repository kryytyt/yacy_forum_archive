Hi LA\_FORGE, didn\'t you forgot to compile the sources?\
\
The git repository only contains source code and dependency libraries,
so after cloning or pulling changes from git you first have to compile
with [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/){.postlink} before running. You
can check the Readme [related
section](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server#how-to-get-the-source-code-and-how-to-compile-yacy-yourself){.postlink}
for compile instructions.\
\
By the way, I don\'t know why since the 1.90 release updates with recent
builds are no more available\... Maybe Orbiter can tell us more?
