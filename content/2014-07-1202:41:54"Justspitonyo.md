> The duo swallow individual frames of 35mm film, excrete them and then
> wash them. Then the damage made to the surface of the film by the
> students\' digestive system was examined using an electron microscope.
> These images were then blown up into large-scale black and white
> prints.
>
> They were warned by medical experts that the biggest risk was colon
> perforation and obstruction, so they created a small capsule to
> loosely contain the rolled film frames. This would prevent the sharp
> edges from perforating the colon while allowing the acids and other
> digestive fluids to flush over the film. They then had to retrieve the
> film by doing their \"business\" in a bag, putting on gloves and
> sifting through.
