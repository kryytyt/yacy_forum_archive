[A Recreation of a 1972 Rothschild
Party:](http://untappedcities.com/2016/06/24/a-night-at-the-exclusive-illuminati-ball-a-recreation-of-a-1972-rothschild-party/)

> The Illuminati Ball was inspired by leaked photos from the infamous
> Surrealist Party hosted by the Baron and Baroness de Rothschild in
> 1972. A night of immersive theater, von Buhler describes the play as
> \"a surreal, bourgeois dinner party filled with power struggles,
> morality tests, and anthropomorphic escapades.\"
>
> Staying true to its secretive nature, attendees are not allowed to
> drive themselves to the event. Instead, a limousine bus picks you up
> on the Upper East Side in New York City and brings you to a massive,
> waterfront estate outside of the city (the location and owner are to
> remain secret). For the festivities, attendees dress to the nines
> (long capes are always welcome). To complete the look, unique masks
> and hats will be provided.
>
> Attendees are also assigned characters belonging to either the pig,
> monkey, cow, chicken or mouse family. Each group has a certain
> mission, certain things they will experience throughout the night,
> making them part of the story, both as a spectator and actor. Upon
> arrival, attendees are briefed, masked, and rehearsed, ready for a
> night of fire performance, opera, aerial silk acts, and esoteric
> ritual ceremonies.
