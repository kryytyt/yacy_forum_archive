been using these bike lights for a bit over a year and I highly
recommend them \-- primarily because they are really not kidding about
the anti-theft guarantee! Since I live in San Francisco, where we can\'t
have nice things, they\'ve now sent me *three* replacement lights for
free, so that has definitely been money well spent.

They\'re *relatively* difficult to steal\... The screws are pentalobe
with a post: obscure but not unheard of. After the first theft, I
\"fixed\" that by filling up the screw head with superglue. The most
recent crackhead managed to steal *half* of the light, which isn\'t
really going to work out so well for them.

They\'re bright and the batteries last a pretty long time. My only real
complaint is that they turn on with a single tap, so often passing
strangers using the same bike rack as me manage to turn them on
accidentally, and I regularly come out to discover a dead battery.
