Mitmachen â€¢ Sysbenchmark
========================

Date: 2014-01-10 20:10:57

I would also do some benchmarks. CPU performance and RAM access
performance are finished, but I have a problem with SD-card and HDD:\
\
I have mixed systems with OS on SD-card and YaCy on the same SD-Card or
on a separate Hard Disk:\
\
How can I say sysbench, which disk I wish to test? My OS is always on
the SD-card. But the YaCy-Folder can be on a HDD (USB or SATA).\
