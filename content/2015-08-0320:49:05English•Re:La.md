SOLR supports two implementations of language detection durig index
time, controlled for by solrconfig.xml, see:
<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Detecting+Languages+During+Indexing>.
The better algo seems to achieve an accuracy of about 99.2% not for all,
but for most languages.\

(How) Could this approach be used as an alternative to the YaCy language
filter?
