[Faszinierendes Essay über die Debt Collectors in den
USA](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/fnord/ar-BBGIpzP). Das ist *noch*
krimineller, als ich annahm. Und ich nahm schon echt nichts
vorteilhaftes an. Wow.

Money Quote:

> Scammers often sell the same portfolios of debt, called "paper," to
> several collection agencies at once, so a legitimate IOU gains
> illegitimate clones. Some inflate balances, a practice known as
> "overbiffing." Others create "redo" lists---people who've settled
> their debt, but will be harassed again anyway. These rosters are
> actually more valuable, because the targets have proved willing to
> part with money over the phone. And then there are those who invent
> debts out of whole cloth.
