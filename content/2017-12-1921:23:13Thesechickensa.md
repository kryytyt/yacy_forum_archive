> The company is targeting China\'s increasingly health-conscious urban
> consumers, who want to trace the origins of chickens labelled as
> organic or free-range, and even follow a bird\'s life to know how it
> [grew up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAlWrT5P2VI) on the farm.
>
> \"Each of our chickens wears an anklet since birth, which is an IoT
> device that connects wirelessly to our blockchain-based network and
> sends real-time data about the bird\'s whereabouts, and how much
> exercise it gets every day,\" Chen Wei, chief executive officer for
> ZhongAn Tech, told the South China Morning Post.
>
> \"When you shop and see raw chicken \[from us\], you can simply check
> on your smartphone app to know its birthplace, what food it ate and
> how many steps it walked during its life.\" \[\...\]
>
> And if consumers find it hard to recognise their birds,
> facial-recognition technology could help them, according to Chen. \"We
> are looking into the possibility of using facial recognition, as it
> could allow consumers to identify their chickens on monitors,\" Chen
> said.
