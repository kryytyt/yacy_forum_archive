> When Joel Thornton at the University of Washington in Seattle and his
> colleagues looked at records of lightning strikes between 2005 and
> 2016 from the World Wide Lightning Location Network, they noticed
> there were significantly more strikes in certain regions of the east
> Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, compared with the surrounding
> areas. Unusually, they occurred along two straight lines in the open
> ocean, which coincided with two of the busiest shipping lanes in the
> world. Along these paths there were twice as many lightning strikes as
> in nearby areas.
>
> \"We were quite sure the ships had to be involved,\" says Thornton.
> But they still had to eliminate other factors that influence storm
> intensity, such as wind speeds and temperatures.
>
> Once these had been ruled out, the team concluded that aerosols from
> the ships\' engine exhausts were the culprit. Aerosol particles act as
> seeds, around which water vapour condenses into cloud droplets. In
> clean air there aren\'t many seeds, so the cloud drops quickly grow
> and fall as rain. But when there are a lot of seeds, like over busy
> shipping routes, a greater number of small cloud drops form. Since
> these are light, they rise up high into the atmosphere and freeze,
> creating clouds rich in ice.
>
> It is this that leads to more intense thunderstorms: lightning only
> occurs if clouds are electrically charged, and this only happens if
> there are lots of ice crystals. \[\...\]
>
> Although lightning activity is higher over the shipping lanes, the
> amount of rainfall is no different to nearby regions.
