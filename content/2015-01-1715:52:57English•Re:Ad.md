=====================================

Thank you. I did update, but it didn\'t fix the problem I am facing.\
I am sure, however, that your fix surely improved things in that
process.\
My problem is more complicated, I suspect.\
The Address Host: \[\]:8090 remains.\
\
However, it seems to be processing the RSS feeds it already has,
curiously.\
The results are readable from other locations.\
Thanks for trying.\
What to do next, please?
