> Although these satellite\'s batteries have long been expired, because
> of some sort of chemical reaction due to thousands of failed recharge
> cycles the batteries begin to conduct over time and allow the
> satellite to be powered directly from the solar panels thus activating
> the transmitter.
>
> Most are not transmitting any usable telemetry or weather images but
> they still use the original frequencies to sent out a unmodulated
> carrier, which interferes with the current operational Satellite\'s in
> the 136/138 MHz band. Normally when a satellite goes out of service
> and runs almost out of fuel the last reserve is used to shift it in a
> graveyard orbit which resides above the normal operation orbit, it
> will be switched off and left on their own.
>
> But this will not always goes as planned, sometimes due solar
> radiation or other technical failures it will not respond again to the
> ground station commands, which leaves the Satellite in its current
> orbit. Some have a timer onboard which will be activated at end of
> life scheduled to end/shortcut the power feed to the transmitter so it
> will not broadcast again, also this can fail.
