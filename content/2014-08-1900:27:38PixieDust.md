> This novel graphics system is based on expansion of
> 3D-acoustic-manipulation technology. In the conventional study of
> acoustic levitation, small objects are trapped in the acoustic beams
> of standing waves. Here, this method is expanded by changing the
> distribution of the acoustic-potential field (APF), which generates
> the graphics using levitated small objects. The system makes available
> many expressions, such as expression by materials and nondigital
> appearance.
>
> In the current system, multiple particles are levitated together at
> 4.25-mm intervals. The spatial resolution of the position is 0.5 mm.
> Particles move at up to 72 cm/s. The allowable density of the material
> can be up to 7 g/cm\^3. This study used three options for APF: a 2D
> grid, high-speed movement, and a combination with motion capture. They
> are used to realize floating-screen or midair raster graphics, midair
> vector graphics, and interaction with levitated objects.
