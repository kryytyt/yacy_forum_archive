  [**kyliu99**](https://twitter.com/kyliu99)       \"The next iPhone will be, I am told, a clear piece of glass.\" Magic, my friends, is real. We do not need engineers. We need wizards!         

  [**max\                                          \"Oh & also, evil sorcerers crippled our divination network Friday by getting millions of coffee makers & lightswitches to shout real loud\"

  [](https://twitter.com/maxgladstone)             \"The problem, it turns out, is that smart coffee makers and lightswitches are pretty dumb, so it\'s easy to convince them to do stuff\"       

  [](https://twitter.com/maxgladstone)             \"Defense Against the Dark Arts specialist Bruce S asked, \'Why enchant your coffee maker so it can talk, just not to you?\'\"                 

  [**cstross**](https://twitter.com/cstross)       From 1990-2015 we were living in an 80s cyberpunk dystopia. 2016-2040: it\'s morphing into urban fantasy.                                      

  [](https://twitter.com/cstross)                  We\'re even close to getting [rich, deranged, long-lived vampires.](http://www.inc.com/jeff-bercovici/peter-thiel-young-blood.html)            

  [](https://twitter.com/cstross)                  Man, living in an urban fantasy universe has got to suck EVEN HARDER than living in a cyberpunk dystopia.                                      

  [](https://twitter.com/cstross)                  I mean, forget the Vampire LeStat or sparkly teen-stalkers, we\'re getting objectivist billionaire Trump-supporter vampires!                   

  [**mhoye**](https://twitter.com/mhoye)           \"Objectivist Billionaire Trump-Supporting Wannabe-Vampire\" seems like a pretty snug Venn diagram. Lot of semantic redundancy there.          

  [**cstross**](https://twitter.com/cstross)       I Thiel your pain.                                                                                                                             

  [**jwz**](https://twitter.com/jwz)               \"Internet of Things as Applied Demonology\" is my favorite part of this dystopia! We\'ve actually implemented Animism. It\'s glorious.        

  [](https://twitter.com/jwz)                      How can we do a greater favor for our paranoid schizophrenic brothers and sisters than by literally making their dreams come true?
