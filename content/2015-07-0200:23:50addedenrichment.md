``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
added enrichment of synonyms and vocabularies for imported documents
during surrogate reading: those attributes from the dump are removed
during the import process and replaced by new detected attributes
according to the setting of the YaCy peer.
This may cause that all such attributes are removed if the importing
peer has no synonyms and/or no vocabularies defined.
```
