Hilfe für Einsteiger und Anwender • Request of certification from browser
=========================================================================

Date: 2013-10-03 11:45:59

My browser is Firefox, an I have configured it to automaticly load YaCy
as my startpage (it seems to work). But when i activate the browser, I
am confronted with a warning saying, that the conection to the
YaCy-engine is not secure. There is missing a certification. I gues it
must be certification of the entrance
\'http://localhost:8090/index.html\'.\
How can I help to satisfy that request? - Hope somebody can adwise me.\
On beforehand, thank You - Ole Rohde.
