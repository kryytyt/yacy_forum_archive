> In this article, we argue that the mafia arose as a response to an
> exogenous shock in the demand for oranges and lemons, following
> Lind\'s discovery in the late eighteenth century that citrus fruits
> cured scurvy. More specifically, we claim that mafia appeared in
> locations where producers made high profits from citrus production for
> overseas export. Operating in an environment with a weak rule of law,
> the mafia protected citrus production from predation and acted as
> intermediaries between producers and exporters. Using original data
> from a parliamentary inquiry in 1881 \-- 1886 on Sicilian towns, the
> Damiani Inquiry, we show that mafia presence is strongly related to
> the production of oranges and lemons. The results hold when different
> data sources and several controls are employed. \[\...\]
>
> Our results are also strongly associated with research on the p
> [\"curse of natural
> resources\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse). We claim
> that the economic boom in international citrus demand, and the
> subsequent rise of Sicilian exports during the nineteenth century, are
> key factors behind the rise of mafia. This is also consistent with the
> more recent finding that windfall gains from natural resources are
> often associated with intense rent seeking and patronage politics. For
> instance, Xavier Sala-i-Martin and Arvind Subramanian (2003) argue
> that political corruption related to oil revenues hampered Nigeria\'s
> growth for decades. Daron Acemoglu, Thierry Verdier, and James A.
> Robinson (2004) show how mineral wealth in Zaire allowed President
> Mobutu to buy off political challengers. A recurrent theme in this
> tradition is that resource windfalls might actually destabilize and
> deteriorate institutions, if key groups in the society believe that
> predation is more profitable than production.

*Hmmm, \'Key groups believe that predation is more profitable than
production\', what does that remind me of\... Oh right! The entirety of
the tech industry!*
