> One side of the disk contains a graphic teaser. The design shows
> headlines in the eight major languages of the world today spiraling
> inward in ever-decreasing size till it becomes so small you have
> trouble reading it, yet the text goes on getting smaller. The
> sentences announce: \"Languages of the World: This is an archive of
> over 1,500 human languages assembled in the year 02008 C.E. Magnify
> 1,000 times to find over 13,000 pages of language documentation.\"

> So assuming the mission continues well, in 2014 the Rosetta Probe will
> land on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, where it will measure the
> comet\'s molecular composition. Then it will remain at rest as the
> comet orbits the sun for hundreds of millions of years. So somewhere
> in the solar system, where it is safe but hard to reach, a backup
> sample of human languages is stored, in case we need one.
