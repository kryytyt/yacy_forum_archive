a stopword-list is always used but the default list is empty. Please see
the YaCy home directory: yacy.stopwords\
This file can be filled with words, one per line.\
\
We experimented with default stopword lists a long time ago and found
out that this does not make sense in many cases. There is no use at all
of them. If you don\'t want results for stopwords, just do not search
for them. If you do not want results with special words in the text,
just don\'t index them, use the content filter in the crawl start.\
\
Because we did not find that stopwords are not usefull, we also have no
hint where to find one. However, you may do experiments with that
feature and tell us your use case.
