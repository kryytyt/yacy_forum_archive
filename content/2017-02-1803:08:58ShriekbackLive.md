> Releasing Shriekback as a live animal after a quarter century of
> strictly studio-based captivity is no small thing. To deliver what we
> want to give and, more importantly, what you want and deserve to hear
> and see, no corners can be cut. If we say so ourselves, we have a huge
> amount of material that means a lot to a lot of people and, on stage,
> we have a lot of history and expectation to live up to. For years now
> we\'ve fielded requests to play live again, but for various reasons,
> whether financial or related to the availability of the core members,
> the ducks haven\'t been in a row: now they are. With some help from
> you, of course.
>
> Since Barry, Martyn and myself have re-established our relationship in
> the studio \-- and found it as thrilling as ever \-- it seems the
> right time to put that chemistry back on the road. But unlike the
> world of recording, where technology has made everything cheaper,
> smaller and faster, the stage lights are as cruel and unblinking as
> ever and the journey into the glare even longer and more expensive.
> So, without further shoe-shuffling, this is what we need.
>
> The band will need to deliver all the force and nuance of a very
> diverse catalogue. We have lined up (ahem) an 8-piece unit that we
> know can hit every mark. Martyn, Barry and myself will be entwined
> with Steve Halliwell on guitar and keyboards and Mike Cozzi on guitar,
> with the Partridge sisters, Wendy and Sarah, on vocals. As Barry
> explained in the video, we can\'t give you Dave Allen, but we\'re
> delighted to announce that we\'ll be joined by Scott Firth on bass -
> Scott comes to us from P.i.L and has played with Martyn extensively on
> other projects, so we know we know The Groove will be just fine.
>
> Eight people means a lot of equipment, rehearsal, transportation,
> accommodation and everything else \-- but if we\'re doing this we\'re
> doing it right and we\'re doing it big. Setting this up, getting it
> rolling from a standing start, is by far the biggest ask of this
> appeal. Once the machine is built and fired up we can take it anywhere
> - and you will very much have a say in where that might be. Given the
> cost and effort of the start-up, we are committed to touring for a
> year from when we roll; this, we believe, will give us the opportunity
> to visit you all, wherever you are.
