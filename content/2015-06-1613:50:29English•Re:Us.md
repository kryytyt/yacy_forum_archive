Set max amount of documents per index and drop oldest documents upon
crawl of new ones.\
\
IIRC, there was a discussion upon how to sort this out, namely on how to
determine which documents to drop: the ones with oldest
[creation]{style="font-style: italic"} date or with oldest
[access]{style="font-style: italic"} date. I would opt to drop the
oldest created documents as that\'s an intuitive approach and won\'t
cause bias on search results. It\'s just a mechanical behavior: [First
In, First Out]{style="font-style: italic"}.\

May this wishlist thread rest in peace. Amen.
