> Suffering from a chest wall sarcoma (a type of cancerous tumour that
> grows, in this instance, around the rib cage), the 54 year old man
> needed his sternum and a portion of his rib cage replaced. This part
> of the chest is notoriously tricky to recreate with prosthetics, due
> to the complex geometry and design required for each patient. \[\...\]
>
> Thoracic surgeons typically use flat and plate implants for the chest.
> However, these can come loose over time and increase the risk of
> complications. The patient\'s surgical team at the Salamanca
> University Hospital thought a fully customised 3D printed implant
> could replicate the intricate structures of the sternum and ribs,
> providing a safer option for the patient.
>
> Using high resolution CT data, the Anatomics team was able to create a
> 3D reconstruction of the chest wall and tumour, allowing the surgeons
> to plan and accurately define resection margins.
