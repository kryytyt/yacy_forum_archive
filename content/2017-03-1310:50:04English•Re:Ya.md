Re: YaCy on the Raspberry Pi-3B (ARM8 Quad Core 1GB RAM)\
\
Greetings to all\
\
I have been wanting to use YaCy as my primary search engine for years.
To make that wish into a reality,\
\
I bought a Raspberry Pi 3 to run YaCy 24/7 connected to my cable modem
like an appliance.\
\
DietPi V145 Running java jdk8 works very fine running YaCy. 1.92. It is
a dream come true.\
\
Now all I need is to find some good documentation on how to get the most
out of YaCy.\
\
For example, I would like to know how to move the directory structure
around so that I could get YaCy to save its data to one of my larger
capacity usb drives.\
\
Right now I am getting an error message that I do not know how to fix.\
\
Free memory is lower than 50 MB. DHT-in has been disabled. Please fix it
as soon as possible and restart YaCy.\
\
Crawling is paused! If the crawling was paused automatically, please
check your disk space.\
\
\
\
Best Regards
