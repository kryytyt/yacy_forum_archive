> Google has been ordered by the Information Commissioner\'s office to
> remove nine links to current news stories about older reports which
> themselves were removed from search results under the \'right to be
> forgotten\' ruling.
>
> The search engine had previously removed links relating to a 10
> year-old criminal offence by an individual after requests made under
> the right to be forgotten ruling. Removal of those links from
> Google\'s search results for the claimant\'s name spurred new news
> posts detailing the removals, which were then indexed by Google\'s
> search engine.
>
> Google refused to remove links to these later news posts, which
> included details of the original criminal offence, despite them
> forming part of search results for the claimant\'s name, arguing that
> they are an essential part of a recent news story and in the public
> interest.
