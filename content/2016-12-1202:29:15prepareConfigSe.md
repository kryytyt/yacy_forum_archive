========================================================================

``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
prepare ConfigSearchPage servlet to append and remove navigator plugins,
keeping order of added nav's.
The search page preview template displays active navs. Therefore a select
and add button has been added below the preview (to keep it close to actual).
This should in future likely be done by drag&drop (html5 feature).
```
