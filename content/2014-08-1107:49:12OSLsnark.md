I don\'t bother posting about bands I didn\'t enjoy, because why bother?
When I post photos of a band I saw, it\'s because I enjoyed them and
recommend that you look into them too.

But, I didn\'t see any good bands on day 3, so, why not:

Lykke Li: The first time I saw her at the Fox, the sound was so awful
that after four songs, my friends and I just went and had a drink next
door instead (take that, Fallacy of Sunk Cost!) This time, the sound was
ok but she was still awful. So how did that first album happen?

Flume: Someone recommended this guy. Look at him, pressing play on other
peoples\' music. Wow.

Cut Copy: I always think, \"Wait, I know these guys, don\'t I? Do I like
them?\" then I see them and re-remember that all of their songs are the
exact same song and that I liked that song better when it was called
*\"Love Vigilantes\".*

The Killers: They started with their one hit, AKA their one good song,
and then played an entire set of ballads and covers of 70s bullshit.

[Warpaint](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/08/warpaint-5/), [Tegan &
Sara](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/08/tegan-sara/), [Arctic
Monkeys](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/08/arctic-monkeys/) and
[Tycho](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/08/tycho/) were good, though. And
this festival is in a really nice part of the park, so it\'s a good
excuse to wander around the woods and drink.

Also: bougiest festival food ever. Instead of your usual street food
nonsense like fries and corndogs, my usual fare was more like: a steamed
pork bun, oysters and a cheese plate. So that part was pretty great.
