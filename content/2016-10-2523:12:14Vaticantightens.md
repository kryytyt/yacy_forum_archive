[![](https://www.jwz.org/images/ewcm14r.gif)\"Following the most ancient
Christian tradition, the Church insistently recommends that the bodies
of the deceased be buried in cemeteries or other sacred places,\" state
the guidelines released Tuesday by the
Vatican.](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/25/499286415/vatican-dont-scatter-cremation-ashes-and-dont-keep-them-at-home)

> The guidelines do not represent a change the church\'s overall policy
> on burial and cremation, but rather underline \"the doctrinal and
> pastoral reasons for the preference of the burial of the remains of
> the faithful and to set out norms pertaining to the conservation of
> ashes in the case of cremation\" \[\...\]
>
> The newly articulated ash norms include not storing human cremains in
> the home and refraining from scattering ashes \"in the air, on land,
> at sea or in some other way \... in order that every appearance of
> pantheism, naturalism or nihilism be avoided.\" \[\...\]
>
> \"The Church raises no doctrinal objections to this practice, since
> cremation of the deceased\'s body does not affect his or her soul,\"
> the guidelines continue, \"nor does it prevent God, in his
> omnipotence, from raising up the deceased body to new life.\"
