added experimental shortlink service
The shortlink uses the message index to resolve a message id into a link
which is given in the link text. In this implementation it is only
possible to resolve one link if only exactly one link is given in the
link text. The shortlink for an id= is then
/x?id=
i.e.
/x?id=660663455268151297
```
