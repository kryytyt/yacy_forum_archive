Didn\'t know that it have to be a integer. Thanks for clearing out this
one for me.\
\
The only thing left for me is to hunt down, where that constant (default
maximum pages per domain in sec) is stored in the source code.\
\
Once again, thanks for the quick responses.\
Good night.\
\
edit:\
Aaaand done. LOL\
I must say, I really like this project. I can see it taking off in the
feature, especially for the advanced users.\
\
Thanks for the help, Orbiter. I appreciate it.
