I would like Debian to stop shipping XScreenSaver
=================================================

[![](https://www.jwz.org/images/obsolete.png)](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/)If
any of you reading this have decision-making ability along those lines,
I would appreciate your assistance in making this happen.

If you\'re wondering why: they are still shipping a version of my
software that I released in *[2014]{.underline}*. Since that\'s a
roughly a decade in software years, it recently began popping up a
single warning dialog when it launches, imploring the user to upgrade.
The comment in the source code justifying this action reads:

> ::: {style="text-indent: -2em;"}
> ` /* ` If you are in here because you\'re planning on disabling this
> warning before redistributing my software, please don\'t.
> :::
>
> I sincerely request that you do one of the following:
>
> ::: {style="padding-left: 2em"}
> 1: leave this code intact and this warning in place, -OR-
>
> 2: Remove xscreensaver from your distribution.
> :::
>
> I would seriously prefer that you not distribute my software at all
> than that you distribute one version and then never update it for

To the surprise of nobody, many of the people commenting on [the Debian
bug report](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=819703)
take the attitude of, \"Well if it\'s *legal* to do something, then it
must also be *right* to do it\", and want to distribute an altered
version of my software against my explicit wishes.

As I said above, I\'d really rather they not do that. I\'d rather they
not distribute it at all.

(\"Upgrade the software more often than every several years\" is
apparently an option they won\'t even countenance, but that\'s neither
here nor there. Though in case you were wondering whether there have
been serious bugs fixed since 2014 \-- security-related bugs \-- the
answer is yes.)

The issue here is taking advantage of a creator\'s work, ignoring their
wishes, and giving nothing back in return. That\'s just lame.
