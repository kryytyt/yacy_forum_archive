A Mozilla Burial
================

It crossed my mind that the Mozilla billboard on the side of my building
might be someone\'s idea of a joke \-- but that would presume that
anyone still working for Mozilla remembers who I am, which seems
unlikely.

But you\'ll note that they didn\'t bother to tear down that billboard
before pouring concrete right up to the property line, so perhaps when
these condos are demolished decades from now to make way for some new
construction the sign will be re-exposed and make someone go, \"What the
hell is *that* supposed to mean?\"
