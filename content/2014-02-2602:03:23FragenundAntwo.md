Fragen und Antworten â€¢ Re: Why settings reset/change on update?
===============================================================

Is there any central resource where package updates could be tracked?\
I\'d love to track the changes and their effects in the configuration.\
I\'m running YaCy on a stable debian box having daily auto update
configured from the YaCy debian repository.\
My experience is that various settings reset from time to time which is
not appropriate for a stable production system.\
\
Thanks,
