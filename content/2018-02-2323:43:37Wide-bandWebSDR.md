> On this page you can listen to and control a short-wave receiver
> located at the amateur radio club ETGD at the University of Twente. In
> contrast to other web-controlled receivers, this receiver can be tuned
> by multiple users simultaneously, thanks to the use of
> Software-Defined Radio.
>
> The system is currently composed of a \"Mini-Whip\" antenna, a
> homebuilt SDR board which samples the entire shortwave spectrum and
> sends all of this via a gigabit ethernet link to a PC, where a special
> version of the WebSDR server software processes it.
