Advertising nonstop
===================

going through today\'s feeds, and there\'s a just-slightly-clever music
video. The music is shitty, the theme is infantile, but it has some
pretty cool visual effects in it. I\'m considering adding it to the list
when I notice that every 20 seconds, there\'s a blatant product
placement for a certain notably-shitty beer.

And not even *clever* product placement: more like, \"we ham-handedly
photoshopped in a bottle of beer into every scene that didn\'t include
someone driving, and only omitted those because the Comics Code
Authority or whatever says we can\'t.\"

It didn\'t end with a sarcastic \"DRINK RESPONSIBLY\" banner, so I guess
they don\'t *literally* believe that this was a commercial. This must
mean it\'s an attempt to do an end-run around someone\'s advertising
guidelines.

No, obviously I\'m not linking to it.
