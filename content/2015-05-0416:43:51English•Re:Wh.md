Hello + Thank you,\
I have copied the indicated api.bheap file from the original machine
into the Work folder of the 2nd and new machine.\
I had tested the new machine with an RSS feed before doing this.\
\
The new machine contains the segments and the data appears to be
normally accessible.\
Hence, the new machine contains the segments of the old machine\...but
not the entire DATA folder, as it was damaged.\
However, the process scheduler shows an empty environment with no
instructions.\
\
It is the instructions we need, of course. There are hundreds of API
based RSS type instructions, plus individual URLs that are needed to be
transferred intact, please.\
\
Both machines were off when the copy and insert too place.\
\
This file comes from a previous machine that could not see the outside
and is the subject of other tickets where we tried to make it see the
outside, again, normally. Hence, it has not crawled for several months.
Understandably, the current api.bheap file is identical in size to the
one we saved when the problem began.\

To help you remember the situation, the original server still shows the
following when the status URL is accessed (n.b., its Ubuntu and YaCy
have been updated to the currently available versions as of today):\
\

> <div>
>
> \
> HTTP ERROR: 403\
> Problem accessing /Status.html. Reason:\
> proxy use not allowed (see System Administration -\> Advanced Settings
> -\> Proxy Access Settings -\> Transparent Proxy; switched off).\
> Powered by Jetty://\
>
> </div>

\
\
\
Thank you for your advice.
