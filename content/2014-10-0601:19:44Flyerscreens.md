Lazyweb,

What\'s the cheapest way to display a full screen HTML animation over
HDMI?

Specifically, I want a device that can:

1.  Output HDMI 720p or better;
2.  Render [this page](http://www.dnalounge.com/flyers/upcoming/) and
    [this page](http://www.dnalounge.com/flyers/upcoming/?cascade) at
    better than 20 FPS;
3.  Boot to a web browser at power-on, displaying said page in
    full-screen mode (no toolbars, etc.)
4.  Ideally, restart automatically after power failure.

This is to replace the Apple TVs that are current running the flyer
display screens located around [DNA Lounge](http://www.dnalounge.com/)
and [DNA Pizza](http://www.dnapizza.com/), since the latest Apple TV and
Flickr updates have rendered those [nearly useless to
us](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/07/appletv/). (Basically: they
introduced a bug that makes the slideshow never refresh unless you
manually delete and re-add the gallery, and it shows no signs of ever
getting fixed.)

We tried a \$90 [Keedox Amlogic
s802](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KF061MQ/), running Android on a 2GKz
quad core, but it only manages about 7 FPS on those pages. We also tried
a Raspberry Pi B, and it was worse than 1 FPS.

I\'m having a hard time believing that the answer is \"a \$600 Mac Mini
is the cheapest, best solution\", but so far I suspect that\'s the
answer.

Aren\'t Linux PCs that can display web pages supposed to be so cheap and
tiny now that they come in cereal boxes?
