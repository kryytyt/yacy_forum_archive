English â€¢ Suspend crawler during a time-window every day
========================================================

Is it possible to configure the process scheduler to periodically pause
the crawler(s) during a specific time-window, every day?\
Looking at my /Table\_API\_p.html, I see listed in the table the entry
for starting the crawler, as it was automatically recorded from my
manual interactions onto /CrawlStartExpert.html. (thank you orbiter for
[teaching me
this](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5601#p31970){.postlink}
:) However there\'s no entry for stopping it, even if I did manually
stop the crawler from /Crawler\_p.html.\
\
Also, I noticed that every time I stop the crawler, YaCy seizes a
serious amount of upload bandwidth for several minutes while the number
of entries in the local crawler queue gradually reduce from a few
millions to zero, by which point the stopping procedure appears to be
complete. So, by this, I\'m not even sure if stopping the crawler for
two or three hours a day on a specific time-window would be effective at
preserving the bandwidth for other purposes.\
Maybe it is possible to just slow down the crawler periodically, without
stopping it completely?
