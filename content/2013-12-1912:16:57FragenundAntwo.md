when you have more RAM in the server, you must assign that in
/Performance\_p.html, otherwise YaCy does not use that.\
Crawling cannot be enhanced much with RAM since crawling obeys speed
rules applied by the response time of the crawled servers. You can speed
up crawling if you crawl a lot of different remote servers at the same
time. YaCy can index tenthousands of documents per minute, but only if
the number of remote servers is large.
