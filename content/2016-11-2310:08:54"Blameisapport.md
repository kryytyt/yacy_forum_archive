[A git repository of Unix commits,
1970-present:](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo)

> The project has achieved its first major goal with the establishment
> of a continuous timeline from 1972 until today:
>
> -   snapshots of PDP-7, V1, V3, V4, V5, V6, and V7 Research Edition,
> -   Unix/32V,
> -   all available BSD releases,
> -   the CSRG SCCS history,
> -   two releases of 386BSD,
> -   the 386BSD patchkit,
> -   the FreeBSD 1.0 to 1.1.5 CVS history,
> -   an import of the FreeBSD repository starting from its initial
>     imports that led to FreeBSD 2.0, and
> -   the current FreeBSD repository.
>
> The files appear to be added in the repository in chronological order
> according to their modification time, and large parts of the source
> code have been attributed to their actual authors. Commands like git
> blame and (sometimes) git log produce the expected results.
