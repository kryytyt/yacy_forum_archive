English â€¢ Peer downgaded from Sr to Jr. Why??
=============================================

Date: 2014-05-06 21:56:27

Hi,\
Yesterday I installed Yacy over a fresh Ubuntu 14.04 Server.\
\
I left it running overnight and now, looking at /Network.html, I
realized that my peer has been downgraded from Sr. to Jr.\
\
Also, in /Status.html, there\'s a warning stating that I can\'t be
reached from the outside (which, I believe, has something to do with the
downgrading).\
\
However, I double checked the server\'s (ufw) and the router\'s firewall
(dd-wrt) and both are showing Yacy\'s port as opened.\
\
Besides, both <http://www.portcheckers.com/> and
<http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/> services show port 8090
as opened.\
\
Is there any way to identify the moment when my peer was downgraded, any
kind of log where I can look for any clue?\
\
Thanks
