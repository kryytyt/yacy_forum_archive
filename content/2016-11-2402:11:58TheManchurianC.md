time the KGB got their goon elected President of the United States?
It\'s like if in *The Manchurian Candidate*, Laurence Harvey was going
around saying \"Chairman Mao is a good friend of mine, he\'s got some
great ideas. Yuge ideas.\"

[Russian Officials Were in Contact With Trump Allies, Diplomat
Says](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/world/europe/trump-campaign-russia.html?_r=3)

> MOSCOW \-- The Russian government maintained contacts with members of
> Donald J. Trump\'s \"immediate entourage\" during the American
> presidential campaign, one of Russia\'s top diplomats said Thursday.
>
> \"There were contacts,\" Sergei A. Ryabkov, the deputy foreign
> minister, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. \"We
> continue to do this and have been doing this work during the election
> campaign,\" he said.
>
> Mr. Ryabkov said officials in the Russian Foreign Ministry were
> familiar with many of the people he described as Mr. Trump\'s
> entourage. \"I cannot say that all, but a number of them maintained
> contacts with Russian representatives,\" Mr. Ryabkov said.

(Electronic voting machines have been a slow motion apocalypse for
*decades*. It would be really ironic if Jill Stein ended up helping to
keep Trump out of the White House, but hey, I\'ll take it.

[As additional votes have been counted in the presidential election,
especially on the West Coast, Hillary Clinton\'s national popular-vote
lead over Donald Trump now exceeds 2 million
votes.](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/hillary-clinton-s-popular-vote-lead-now-over-two-million-n687701)

> To put that popular-vote margin into perspective, Al Gore\'s
> popular-vote lead over George W. Bush in 2000 - when Bush won the
> Electoral College - was 547,000 votes. Also noteworthy: Clinton\'s
> 64-plus million votes is nearing in on the 65.9 million Barack Obama
> won in 2012.

> Of course, presidents are elected by the Electoral College, not the

[Interestingly, Trump has deleted a number of tweets he sent in 2012,
including:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/15/trumps-flip-flop-on-the-electoral-college-from-disaster-to-genius/)

> \"He \[Obama\] lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election. We

> \"The phoney \[sic\] electoral college made a laughing stock out of

> \"More votes equals a loss\...revolution!\"
>
> \"This election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a

>
> \"The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.\"
