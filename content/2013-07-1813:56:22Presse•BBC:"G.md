> \
> Instead of using its own servers to index the web, it relies on its
> users\' computers to do the work via software it provides. The
> information gathered is then shared to a common database, fragments of
> which are distributed across the network.\

> Because the answer to any query is obtained from other volunteers\'
> computers rather than a central portal, Yacy says it is impossible for
