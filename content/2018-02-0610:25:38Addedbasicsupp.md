Added basic support for autotagging microdata annotated item types.

With the appropriate vocabulary settings in Vocabulary_p.html page, this
can produce Vocabulary search facets displaying item types referenced in
html documents by microdata annotation.
Tested notably, but not limited to, vocabulary classes/types defined by
Schema.org and Dublin Core.
