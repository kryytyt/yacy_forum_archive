That is not the intention of this proposal to present best/good ranking
only by after-treatment (e.g. via JS).\
I strongly belief that this is one of the main and important task for
the engine to spit things out in the desired order.\
\
P.S. as mentioned elsewhere\.... maybe have a look at the unmaintained
JS search interface under htroot/yacy/ui/\* if the aftertreatment path
can be incorporated there to revitalize that route.\
\
Maybe I\'d read your github article again, because the algorithm
(criteria) for re-sorting via JS to improve ranking order might be
what\'ve overlooked but is what I\'m after.
