Well, i think i will try your recommend setup. However not having the
ability to search within the p2p is not what i want. I have no problem
getting \"unwanted\" results if i search the network, i just don´t want
to contribute storage to stuff i am not interested in. Aka: [My books
are your books, and your books are my books. But don´t put your books on
my shelf.]{style="font-weight: bold"} (with whitelist (unless i have a
dedicated shelf for them)
