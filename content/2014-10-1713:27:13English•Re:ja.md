I was able to reproduce this problem. During debugging I found a hint to
the actual problem which is described in
[http://teknosrc.com/javax-net-ssl-sslpr \...
me-solved/](http://teknosrc.com/javax-net-ssl-sslprotocolexception-handshake-alert-unrecognized_name-solved/){.postlink}
which means this appears only in Java 1.7. Since we are forced to use
Java 7 now, I made the suggested fix which is up in
[https://gitorious.org/yacy/rc1/commit/1 \...
d8070d806d](https://gitorious.org/yacy/rc1/commit/11074d8d246c5d5cb1bfb7835f64eed8070d806d){.postlink}\
\
please upgrade to yacy\_v1.81\_20141017\_9106 which includes the fix.
