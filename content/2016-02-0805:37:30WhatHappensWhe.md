> tucked me back into bed with a big bag of salt and vinegar potato
> chips and turned on Gilmore Girls. After hallucinating that Lauren
> Graham\'s face was morphing into Ryan Gosling\'s face for just a few

> proceeded to nap for four hours. I woke up with potato chips all over
> my body, then asked my boyfriend to help wash me off in the shower
> because I didn\'t feel capable of doing that on my own. I also vaguely
> remember having a mild panic attack about the fact that I didn\'t know
> where our cat was. We don\'t have a cat.

> The next few days are a blur of snacking and crying. There are 10 text
> threads on my phone that I don\'t remember typing and mysterious empty
> bags of Cheetos strewn about my apartment.
