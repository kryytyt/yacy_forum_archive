Actually, I\'m not forwarding the graphs to a dyndns account, but giving
[direct access to my Cacti server]{style="font-style: italic"}, through
a guest account.\
\
Anyway, I like your idea: much simpler, safer and robust.\
\
On my side, I\'m ready to send the graphs somewhere.\

As for the web space, do you have already one to which I should ftp the
graphs? (I\'m assuming that those graphs will be made public in your
site or anywhere else, right?) In this case, I would need to know
username/password.
