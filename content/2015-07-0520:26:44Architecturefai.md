Architecture fail

has this central waterfall in the middle of its huge atrium. For years,
there has been a sign next to it saying, and I paraphrase, \"Stop
whining at us about wasting water, this thing is a part of the
building\'s HVAC system, we\'re so green.\"

But now, it\'s turned off, and there\'s a new sign that says \"No
waterfall for you, because drought.\"

I AM SURROUNDED BY LIES AND I DON\'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE!!

Also: this fountain is one of my favorite examples of design not
surviving contact with The Enemy. The water lands in this flat circular
area that is level with the rest of the floor, pooling only about half
an inch deep before draining off at the edges, like a small-scale
\"infinity pool\".

But it\'s surrounded by sixteen absolutely hideous planters that look
completely out of place, and break everything up.

I *guarantee* those planters weren\'t a part of the plan. I\'m certain
that they went in on *day two* after they realized that 50% of the
people passing through the building just blindly walked underneath the
waterfall and got soaked.

Which would be the best feature *ever*. They should have left it alone.
That would have *never* stopped being funny!
