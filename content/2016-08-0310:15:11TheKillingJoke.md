shit.

When I heard they were adding a larger Batgirl plot to this story, I
thought, \"Oh good, they\'re going to make her more than the awful prop
she was in the comic.\" Nope, they went in completely the opposite
direction.

Spoiler, because I want to spoil it for you so that you won\'t see it:
the first 30 minutes is Batgirl pining after Batman, swooning about him
to her Gay Best Friend from Central Casting (yes, really). And then she
fucks Batman. And he won\'t return her calls, so she quits being
Batgirl.

It was as bad as you\'d expect, having read about [this lovely
exchange](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/07/23/using-sex-and-pining-for-bruce-the-killing-joke-qa-from-the-san-diego-screening/)
at Comicon:

So that\'s Brian Azzarello removing any doubt that not only did he write
a terrible story, but that he\'s also human garbage.

Mark Hamill\'s voice is perfect \-- he will always be the One True Joker
to me \-- but he can\'t save this movie.
