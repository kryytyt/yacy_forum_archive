ok, for now, I managed to upload the graphs to ucoz.com, the only free
web hosting company that allows ftp.\
\
On my side, I created a script that uploads the graphs on an hourly
basis.\
\
The link is <http://yacystats.ucoz.com/>\
\
By clicking on each graph, you\'ll get different types of granularity.\
\
I\'m just still not sure if ucoz.com will keep this site forever, or if
they will consider that it is not being updated frequently.
