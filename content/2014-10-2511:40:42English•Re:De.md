Yes, i have the same opinion. But i think the most important Step in
this direction is the inclusion of the SSL-Port into the Seedlists,
after this i will add a HTTP[S]{style="font-weight: bold"}-Forwarder to
my tool.\

66k what? HTTP[S]{style="font-weight: bold"}-Accesses to your
YaCy-Peer?\

Yes, this information is included in the Seedlists, but the Port-Number
is not.\

Thanks. After some small fixes and improvements of the current
feature-set of my tool, the DNS-Server (for UDP-Port 53) is the next
task on my todo-list.\
