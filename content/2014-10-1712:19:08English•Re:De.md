I do not think that this is a good idea, the design goal of the
Peer-to-Peer-Management-Logic in YaCy is too much different. And the
Logic in the most YaCy-Peers does not know really all active YaCy-Peers,
and the Logic in YaCy is too slow for a fast changing network.\

Nice idea! If you can do that, i would be happy. When the problems with
IPv6 in YaCy are solved, we can add the IPv6-Address of my Server.\
But please note that the HTTP-Server in my Tool does not answer for the
URL \'/\' (it generates a 404) and it is not available at Port 80. If
you create a real Domain-Name than there must be a Forwarder to my URL
that do listen on Port 80 and for the URL \'/\' (or ignoring the URL at
all).\
I have a small Web-Space (on a shared Web Hoster) and i will try a
similar Feature for a subdirectory with a special .htaccess (i have
talked about this kind of idea with flegno 2 weeks ago, see
[here](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?t=5379#p30838){.postlink}).\

This is exactly the reason why i think on yacy.net should be an iframe
or a Link or something similar to
<http://130.255.73.69:5353/forward?random>.\
This would show the Power of a distributed System and enable all Users,
that are not able to run their own YaCy-Instance, for using the
YaCy-Search-Engine without overstressing a single machine (or a small
number of \"special selected\" machines).\
\
I am not sure but i think my service should be able to handle more than
100 forwarding-operations per second. This means there must be at least
100 new Searchers per Second to overstressing my service. This means not
that my Service is absolute \"DoS proof\" but you need much more power
to DoS my Service compared to the DoS-Power needed for overstressing
multiple YaCy-Peers.\
