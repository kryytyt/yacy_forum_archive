Hey DNcrawler, for now I
[updated](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commit/9cea7cbb10449f0b1b4a3b871424298836bbe633){.postlink}
the webstructure Javadoc to reflect as much as possible the current
usage and implementation.\
\
With my own tests it looks like it worked as expected, even if at first
the \"latest\" parameter can be a little confusing.\
\
Regarding your remark

could it be that you crawled example.net and example.ru but not
example.com (because of crawl depth setting for example)?\
In that case it is normal behavior that the api only report inbound
links from example.net and example.ru to example.com because YaCy
doesn\'t know links coming out from example.com until you crawl it\...\
\
Regarding performance, I have some ideas to explore, but it will take
some time to measure and test.
