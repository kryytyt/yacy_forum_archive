Sorry, for my hard words.\
\
In my Opinion, from a users point of view, it is far too inappropriate
than a developer of a software write a [not
working]{style="text-decoration: underline"} software is not enough
pressure for doing anything. What kind of problem can be more pressure
(from the point of view of an affected user) than a completely [not
working]{style="text-decoration: underline"} software? I can not believe
that xioc752 is glad to read this kind of statement from the developer
of a software he use. Near a statement that means it is a
[fact]{style="font-style: italic"} that his Browser is misconfigured, in
a scenario that clearly proves that the Browser is not the problem (one
of two Peers is successful accessible, probably with the same Browser,
and the Proxy in YaCy is disabled that means with a Browser that use
this Proxy is [nothing]{style="font-style: italic"} reachable).\

In this forum is the 403-Error reported multiple times by multiple
users:\

(okay, this is the current problem and it may not count here)\
If you really mean this Error does not exist, why is it reported so many
times by so many different people?\
Most of the reported scenarios describe that only some ways for
accessing a YaCy-Peer does not work and other ways does work, this fact
implies that the used Browsers are not misconfigured (in the way you
write [here (last
line)](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?t=5165#p31375){.postlink}).\
\
If you really mean this Error does not exist, what do my Browser wrong
in my test
[here](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?t=5165#p31378){.postlink}?
(the Code-Snippet is one complete TCP-Connection)\

How can it be? A real existing Error without erroneous Code?\
It may be a problem that is created by the interaction between multiple
pieces of Code, or by a presumption of one piece of Code about an other
piece of Code.\

Yes, this is exactly that i did expect. I think the 403-HTTP-Response
comes from inside of the Proxy. In the HTTP-Server-Front-End exist a
piece of Code that distinguish between HTTP-Server and Proxy, and a
wrong decision (using the Proxy instead of using the HTTP-Server)
results in the well known 403-HTTP-Response. From the point of view of
the Proxy, the 403-Error is correct, in cases the Proxy is disabled or
not usable by the Client-IP-Address. The problem is not the 403-Error
from the Proxy, the problem is produced by using the Proxy for accesses
that must handled by the HTTP-Server. You should look for Code that do
the decision between Proxy and HTTP-Server.\
\
Please tell me what is the function/intention of
\"net.yacy.cora.protocol.Domains.isLocal()\". It seems that it is used
in \"net.yacy.http.YacyDomainHandler.handle()\" for the decision between
local and nonlocal HTTP-Destinations.\
\
If this is the wrong spoor, i have written that i can reliable produce
the 403-Error on [your]{style="text-decoration: underline"} YaCy-Peer
(last tested a few minutes ago). Why not inserting a Stack-Trace-Dump
into the Handler for \"HttpServletResponse.SC\_FORBIDDEN\" and tell me
the time when i should access your Peer and you can see the reason of
the 403-Error in [your]{style="text-decoration: underline"} Log-File? If
you want i can tell you my IP-Address before this test, this makes it
possible to log with Wireshark only the interesting HTTP-Access and you
must not trust on me if i say my Browser use only the simple
GET-Command-Variant.\
\
I think there are a lot of possible ways to produce and observe this
Error, we must just do it.\
\
\
\@xioc752:\
i was wrong, the decision code seems to be configurable:\
Insert a line with \"network.unit.domain = any\" into your
%yacy-home%/DATA/SETTINGS/yacy.conf or set the value to \"any\" if a
line with \"network.unit.domain =\" is already present.\
This configuration-line sets the property \"isAllIPMode\" to \'true\'
and this sets the property \"noLocalCheck\" to \'true\'. In the class
\"net.yacy.cora.protocol.Domains\" exists some methods \"isLocal()\", as
far as i can see this methods decides for every incoming HTTP-Request it
is for the local YaCy-Peer (and handled by the internal HTTP-Server) or
it is for an external resource (and handled by the Proxy), and this
decision depends on the property \"noLocalCheck\" (among other
properties). But please be warned, the property \"AllIPMode\" seems to
be responsible for a lot of other internal features in YaCy and may have
[interesting]{style="font-style: italic"} side effects.\
