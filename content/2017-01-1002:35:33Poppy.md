[This Is Not an Interview with
Poppy](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-is-not-an-interview-with-poppy)

> Poppy\'s internet presence can be traced back to a YouTube video
> upload on November 4, 2014 which features her eating cotton candy.
> Today, this account is populated with hundreds of absurdist videos
> like the one above, the vast majority of which feature Poppy in a
> featureless space, posing existential questions over an ethereal
> soundtrack. The content of these short videos varies widely: there are
> two videos that are just 50 minutes of Poppy reading the Bible, a
> video of Poppy showing her viewers how to load a pistol (this video
> has since been removed), a video in which she shills for Tide
> detergent, and another where she talks about browsing /b/, an image
> board on 4chan.
>
> But if you have the patience to work your way through all the videos
> on this channel, certain trends start to emerge. The most obvious is
> Poppy\'s fixation with the internet and social media culture, which
> she claims to love. But far more interesting is the general tone of
> the videos, which have gotten progressively darker over the last two
> years. Poppy\'s early videos feature a bright-eyed young girl clearly
> enamored with her glamorous pop lifestyle and her fans. Yet Poppy\'s
> character soon changes \-- she begins posing increasingly dark
> questions (\"Do you know what\'s happening? Have they told you? What
> rhymes with breath?\"), talks about running away and wanting to
> disappear, references secrets that her \"handlers\" won\'t let her
> tell her viewers, and suggests that she is being controlled by a vague
> \"they\" from whom she cannot escape.
