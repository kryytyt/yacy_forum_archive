I have done some more tests. Of several tests I find this one very
interesting:\
\
Server is doing one crawl, 30PPM. Network is set peer-to-peer mode.
Inbound traffic on port 8090 has been firewalled during the test period.
The installation was working fine and got remote results from other
peers just fine for a whole week. (Sunday to Sunday)\
\
Then, I opened port 8090. Two hours later the software was unresponsive.
The process was running and port 8090 was open but when telneting to the
port the server was accepting the connection but not responding to any
HTTP-commands. The process could be killed without force. (using normal
kill PID, not kill -9 PID)\
\
This shows that the server are not responding well to inbound
peer-to-peer requests. My investigation shows that during the timeframe
of about 2 hours the port was open the server got about 8.000 requests
on port 8090. I will do some more tests, trying to analyze the traffic
more using some network tools.\
\
What do you think? Is this just YaCy overwhelmed with traffic from its
peers, or could it be some kind of DoS attack towards the network? Why
is it the software just stop responding? (not crashing/exiting)
