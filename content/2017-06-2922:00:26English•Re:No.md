Just out of interest I ran a test to check your peer performance /
response. You might have your connection swamped at the moment.
<https://www.webpagetest.org/result/170629_00_1BK8/> Its easy to retest
and gives a lot of information about your site.\
\
This is the result from an old PC 1GB and adls2 connection.
<https://www.webpagetest.org/result/170629_F7_1BJ4/> it may time out
sometimes due to what I am doing.\
\
Not knowing your system total ram setting of 3 GB I think consumes 6 GB
it sets Xmx and Xms the same.\
I have a spread sheet that is in experimental testing for Java Xmx and
Xms in yacy at <https://github.com/smokingwheels/chopper>\
If you wish to try then shutdown peer change Xmx and Xms in
/DATA/SETTINGS/yacy.conf and start peer again.
