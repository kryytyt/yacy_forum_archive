Fragen und Antworten â€¢ Stop-Words
=================================

Date: 2014-10-12 17:19:17

Hi,\
somehow the option to activate stop-words is missing from
CrawlStartExpert.html (actually I can find it anywhere). Version
1.81/9030 or higher.\
\
Additional questions:\
1. Is it right that the option to use stop-words is activated by
default?\
\
2. What is the correct layout for the yacy.stopwords file?\
\
is it:\

Code: 
:   `# Commentyacy.stopwords.en #special for ENyacy.stopwords.de #Special for DE#html, htm, www, src #Default, these are always used, independent of Country Code....`

?\
\
3. Is there a good Stop-Word list somewhere ready?\
\
4. Is it possible to clean the index with a new stop-word list? Or do I
in need to re-crawl?\
\
Thanks
