====================================

``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
Added a CSS class for infobox block.

This will prevent mistakenly hiding a div element not designed to be an
infobox but having a ".info" parent (After having previously added the
possibility for a div - and not only a span element - to be an infobox).
```
