> Again, I just go in and work the energy. And there are different
> stones that work really well on computers, chloride is one of them.
> Also, some people really like amethyst for computers. It doesn\'t
> really work for me, but I\'m psychic. So when I go into the room where
> somebody\'s computer is, I go in fresh, I step in like a fresh sheet,
> and I\'m open to feel what\'s going on with the computer.
> Everything\'s unique, which is why my spell work changes, because each
> project I do is unique.
>
> Sometimes I do a magic spell or tape a magic charm onto the computer
> somewhere. Sometimes I have a potion for the worker to spray on the
> chair before they sit down to work. Jet is a stone I use a lot to
> protect computers.
>
> Tell me about a time when you successfully cleared a virus.

> I got contacted by a small business owner in Marin county. She had a
> couple of different viruses and she called me in. First, I cast a
> circle and called in earth, air, fire and water, and then I called in
> Mercury, the messenger and communicator. Then I went into a trance
> state, and all I was doing was feeling. I literally feel \[the virus\]
> in my body. I can feel the smoothness where the energy\'s running, and
> then I feel a snag. That\'s where the virus got in.
>
> Then I performed a vanishing ceremony. I used a black bowl with a
> magnet and water to draw \[the virus\] out. Then I saged the whole
> computer to chase the negativity back into the bowl, and then I
> flushed that down the toilet. After this I did a purification
> ceremony. Then I made a protection spell out of chloride, amethyst,
> and jet. I left these on the computer at the base where she works.
