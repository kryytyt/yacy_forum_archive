English â€¢ Re: Filter specific urls from scarping
================================================

For example I started crawling on \"http://askubuntu.com/questions\",
and on path I selected the \"load only files in a sub-path of given
url\" option. I also added \"askubuntu.com/users/\*\" to blacklists, but
crawling monitor still displayed user URLs like
\"http://askubuntu.com/users/163406/user1945827\" in the list of scraped
URLs.\
\
It also reported crawling URLs like
\"http://askubuntu.com/questions?page=2&sort=newest\", so I guess that
\"?\" filter is not being applied.\
\
At askubuntu.com you can choose to list 15, 30 or 50 questions / page. I
wonder if Yacy is smart enough to avoid scraping this list tree times
instead of once. On the other hand questions themselves have been
scraped already, so it isn\'t too bad to go over this list multiple
times. Correct me if I\'m wrong\...
