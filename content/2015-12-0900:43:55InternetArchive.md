Would you like to perform at the telethon? If so, let me or
[Jason](mailto:jason@textfiles.com) know.

The Internet Archive is awesome and important and you should give them
your money!

I offered to help them find some acts, and I got them in touch with a
few folks, but of the more-than-a-dozen local bands that I and my booker
have reached out to over the last couple of weeks, exactly one has even
*written back* (and that was a no.)

I guess I shouldn\'t be too surprised, since it seems like the only
bands we\'re capable of booking at DNA lately are either black metal, or
90s Sunset-Strip-hard-rock acts on a reunion tour. And I didn\'t ask any
of those. Sigh.
