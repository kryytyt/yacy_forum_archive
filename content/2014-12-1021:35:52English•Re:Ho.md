English â€¢ Re: How to get YACY working as a proxy
================================================

I tried yacy.info which worked fine without exceptions. I reloaded about
20 times without one error.\
I looked into the YaCy http server code (again) there is not even a code
line which contains the number \"403\" or
HttpServletResponse.SC\_FORBIDDEN.\
From my view this error does not exist and there is no code that it can
produce.\

From a moderators point of view, this is a far too inappropriate
proposition to be acceptable.\
As a forum moderator I suggest you take a time-out from this place.
