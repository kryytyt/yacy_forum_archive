Astronomers from around the world will gather in Japan later this month to present the most detailed images of quasars ever seen, produced with data from the Very Long Base Interferometry Space Observatory Program. Space VLBI, as this is known, is a new type of astronomy mission that uses a combination of satellite- and Earth-based radio antennas to create a telescope more than two-and-a-half times the diameter of the Earth.
