as an average user this log output is all gibberish to me but thanks for
the snarky response.\

However, I would like to point out that on a mac with Java 6 installed
it is very difficult to simply disable and re-enable Java 6, let alone
delete it entirely, without Unix experience. Expert users may elect to
delete key files to prevent Java 6 apps from ever running, but it\'s not
a great idea for the average user without Unix and command line
experience. It\'s better to be aware if you\'re running a native Java
app, built for Java 6, and then keep Java 6 updated (with Software
Update in OS X). Otherwise, find an alternative non-Java solution or do
a complete fresh reinstall on my OS.\

Yeah, OK. So in order to just even try out YaCy I have to do a clean
reinstall. Good luck with that.
