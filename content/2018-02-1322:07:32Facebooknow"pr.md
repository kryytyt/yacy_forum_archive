Facebook iOS app now has a menu item labelled \"Protect\" that installs
a Facebook\'s own VPN app. This lets Facebook \"protect\" you by
intercepting and spying on the traffic of *every other app on your
phone* including your web browser.

So that\'s pretty sweet.

> Marketing Onavo within Facebook itself could lead to a boost in users
> for the VPN app, which promises to warn users of malicious websites
> and keep information secure as you browse. But Facebook didn\'t buy
> Onavo for its security protections.
>
> Instead, Onavo\'s VPN allow Facebook to monitor user activity across
> apps, giving Facebook a big advantage in terms of spotting new trends
> across the larger mobile ecosystem. For example, Facebook gets an
> early heads up about apps that are becoming breakout hits; it can tell
> which are seeing slowing user growth; it sees which apps\' new
> features appear to be resonating with their users, and much more.
>
> This data has already helped Facebook in a number of ways, most
> notably in its battle with Snapchat. At The WSJ reported last August,
> Facebook could tell that Instagram\'s launch of Stories \-- a
> Snapchat-like feature \-- was working to slow Snapchat\'s user growth,
> before the company itself even publicly disclosed this fact.
