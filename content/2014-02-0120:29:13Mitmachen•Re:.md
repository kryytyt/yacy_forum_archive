Also Olimex has now an own ARM based Linux board system: OLinuXino (eg.
A20 dual core 1GByte RAM and SATA for 55,00 Euro).\
\
see <https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/A20/>\
\
The special of this boards are a lot possibilities in order to connect
hardware. From a lot of GPIOs until grafic displays. These displays are
tested and distributed from Olimex. And the price seems really good.\
\
There are low price boards similar to RasPi.\
