I heard that [9.7% of San Francisco voted for
Trump](http://sfist.com/2016/11/09/who_are_you_people.php), I was
puzzled, because does San Francisco even *have* that many cops?

Turns out, no: 26k Trump voters, 2,100 cops. So the rest of them must
work for Peter Thiel and his Brownshirt Combinator.

Last night we had an event that was a [musical tribute to the movies of
John Carpenter](https://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2016/11-18.html), so
I busted out my *\"MAKE AMERICA
[OBEY](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/10/they-live-and-the-secret-history-of-the-mozilla-logo/)
AGAIN\"* costume. On
[Halloween](https://www.dnalounge.com/gallery/2016/10-29/), that costume
seemed funny. After last week, it doesn\'t seem so
[funny](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/11/john-olivers-half-hour-monologue-on-trump-is-amazing/)
any more.

And then\... some guy thought I was *not joking* and straight up
admitted that he voted for Trump. To the guy dressed as a
methane-breathing space zombie.

Can you imagine how disconcerting that is? \"Very disconcerting\", is
the answer. Judges would also accept \"baffling\", \"horrifying\", and
\"hyperventilating inside a latex mask seems like it might be bad for
you\".

Then *some other* pinhead told me I was \"brave\" for wearing that
costume and that he voted for Johnson. \"Because Hillary? Is like
corrupt? Or something?\"

I mean we only had like 200 people there, and 1% of them not only boldly
admitted to [voting to fuck us all with
switchblades](https://www.jwz.org/images/spider_jerusalem_on_voting.jpg),
but weren\'t even ashamed of it.

It\'s enough to drive me to drink, I tell you.
