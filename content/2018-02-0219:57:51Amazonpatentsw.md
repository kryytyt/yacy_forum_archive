[If a worker\'s hands begin to move toward the wrong direction, the
\"haptic feedback system\" would cause the wristband to buzz and direct
their hand in the correct
direction.](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/amazon-patents-wristbands-designed-steer-employees-movements-article-1.3792895)

> The wristbands, according to the [patent
> documents](https://www.google.com/patents/US20170278051), were
> designed as a means to keep track of products within Amazon warehouses
> as well as up day-to-day productivity.
>
> The proposed tech could also provide Amazon management with a new
> means of workplace surveillance that would alert them to staffers who
> are wasting time or breaking for too long.
>
> Amazon in the past has been accused of unbearable workplace conditions
> \-- including timed bathroom breaks and 55-hour work weeks \-- put in
> place to ensure the company is fulfilling shipping goals. The company
> did not immediately return a request for comment.

*Imagine if instead of \"employees\", these could be force-feedback
Waldoes controlling ~~zombies~~ Residual Human Resources from a remote
location!*
