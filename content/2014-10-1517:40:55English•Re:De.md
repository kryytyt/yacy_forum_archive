If YaCy gets successfull and the demo portal would scale to so much
people who wants to use that, than at any point we would need a data
center [and]{style="font-style: italic"} a business model. But that is
not what this project is about.\

If you think this to the end then you must conclude that the demo portal
is not a good idea at all. so.. this brings me (again) to the point
where I believe that removing the demo is the only way to protect YaCy
from criticism in the way you argued.
