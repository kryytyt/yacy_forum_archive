Can anyone find a higher resolution copy of [this deleted scene from
*Tank Girl*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIb5PrjcHLI)?

Apparently they spent \$5,000 on Booga\'s prosthetic penis, and then\...
cut it.^`*`^

I would very much like to edit this back into the movie for our
screening of it at [*Cyberdelia* on Fri, Jan
29](https://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2016/01-29.html), but a 360x240
postage stamp isn\'t gonna do it\...
