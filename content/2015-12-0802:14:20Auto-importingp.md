Auto-importing phone photos on OSX 10.11
========================================

Date: 2015-12-08 02:14:20

When I plug in my phone, I want the photos on it to be automatically
copied, unaltered, as files, to some folder; and then deleted from the
phone.

I will not use iCloud. I do not want to ever use the Photos or iPhoto
interface to get at my photos. I just want the damned files.

Apparently the \"autoimport\" option in Image Capture is gone now. So
how do I make this happen?
