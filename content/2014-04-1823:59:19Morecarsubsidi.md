[SFMTA Board Repeals Sunday Parking Meters: Get ready for the return of
Sunday traffic dysfunction and double
parking.](http://sf.streetsblog.org/2014/04/15/sfmta-board-repeals-sunday-parking-meters/)

> Mainstream news reporters who have covered the Sunday metering issue,
> like columnists Phil Matier and Andrew Ross at the SF Chronicle and
> CBS affiliate KPIX, typically don\'t mention that the SFMTA found that
> meters cut cruising times for parking in half and increased turnover
> for businesses by at least 20 percent. Instead, parking meters have
> typically been framed as a way to collect revenue, even in the
> Chronicle report on today\'s vote. \[\...\]
>
> As we reported, there\'s [no evidence to support Mayor Lee\'s
> claims](http://sf.streetsblog.org/2014/03/20/contrary-to-ed-lee-records-show-no-popular-revolt-against-sunday-meters/)
> that anyone besides church leaders have pushed to give away Sunday
> parking. Indeed, the only speakers who showed up to encourage the
> SFMTA Board to repeal Sunday meters were the same church leaders who
> campaigned against the policy in the first place. \[\...\]
>
> Tanev said the parking meter reversal \"violates all semblance of
> competence in government and public process. Your own report shows
> that meters are beneficial to businesses and shoppers, reduce
> congestion and increase pedestrian safety.\"
>
> \"Sunday meters were passed in collaboration with many stakeholders,
> including the Chamber of Commerce. It is a betrayal that they are
> revoked without the same process applied when they passed.\"
>
> \"You\'re nobody\'s puppets,\" Tanev told the SFMTA Board. \"You work
> for free. Be willing to be fired, do the right thing, and let the
> politicians take the blame if they interfere in your work.\"
