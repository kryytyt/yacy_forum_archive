These addresses are used as an yacy-internal identifier and are not
resolvable/reachable on the internet. The modsecurity module \"sees\"
this kind of traffic because the YaCy P2P-Communication isn\`t
encrypted. I think the devs are on it to implement secure YaCy \<=\>
YaCy communications in future releases.\
\
I\`m working as an security engineer and I\'m participating over 6 years
in the YaCy Community. I\`m able to assure that YaCy doesn\'t have any
spy or phonehome features built in. When you sceptical about your
security I recommend to install an intrusion detection system such as
Snort.
