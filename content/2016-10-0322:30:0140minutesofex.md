> The nixie tube is a vintage display device which had been used until
> 70s when it was replaced with LED displays. The complex knowledge of
> manufacture of nixie tubes literally died with tube factory\'s
> engineers, glassblowers and machine operators.
>
> I discovered nixie tubes in 2011 and since then, I\'ve devoted all my
> time to studies of nixie tubes and its manufacturing processes. After
> years of intensive work, with help of many people, I eventually
> succeeded and have revived the knowledge and equipment for production
> of nixie tubes.
