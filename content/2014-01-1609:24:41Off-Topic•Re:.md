Concerning the English forum: It has been set up by a person who lost
interest in YaCy some time ago but kept running the forum anyway. I am
a/the moderator of the English forum and I try to keep it clean from
spam and illegal content, but I don\'t have the time to contribute much
content-wise.\
\
To allow me to have more control on the forum (updates, plugins, \...)
the person who runs the forum at the moment and I agreed to move the
forum to my webspace and to transfer the domain to me. Currently I am
trying to create a running copy of the forum to be able to make a smooth
transition later. Unfortunately the lack of time on my side is the
limiting factor at the moment. I hope we get the transition done in
January though.\
\
I was thinking about giving away subdomains for free (for example
fr.yacy-forum.org, es.yacy-forum.org), but I am still hesitating for the
legal reasons Orbiter mentioned.
