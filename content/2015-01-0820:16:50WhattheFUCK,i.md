I didn\'t even \"upgrade\" anything!

Do I now have to do a full reset and wait 2 days for all of my music to
sync again?

Answer: Yes. Yes I do.

I tried dicking around with using ifunbox to delete
medialibrary.sqlitedb but that didn\'t make \"Other\" transmute back
into \"Music\". Then I used it to delete all the music, and after iTunes
got unconfused it re-synced everything. *Maybe* this is marginally
better than restoring from backup because I won\'t have to re-enter all
of my passwords (iTunes\'s idea of \"backups\" being \"don\'t actually
back up anything that *matters*\") but it\'s still going to take 2 days
to do the sync.

FFFFFFUUUUUUU\...
