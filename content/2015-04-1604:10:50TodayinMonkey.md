Milk Without the Cow Is Coming to Change Food
Forever](http://www.wired.com/2015/04/diy-biotech-vegan-cheese/)

> They\'re trying to make cow\'s milk cheese without the cow. Using
> mail-order DNA, they\'re tricking yeast cells into producing a
> substance that\'s molecularly identical to milk. And if successful,
> they\'ll turn this milk into cheese. Real cheese. But vegan cheese.
> Real vegan cheese.
>
> That\'s the name of the project: Real Vegan Cheese. These hackers want
> cheese that tastes like the real thing, but they don\'t want it coming
> from an animal. Abandoning real cheese is one of the hardest
> sacrifices vegans must make, says one member of the group, Benjamin
> Rupert, a chemist by training and a vegan for the past decade. With
> Real Vegan Cheese, they won\'t have to. \"What we\'re making is

> anything up, really.\"

This is what we call \"burying the lead\":

> The possibilities include not just vegan cow cheese, but, well, vegan
> human cheese. The same basic process for synthesizing cow\'s milk
> applies to milk from any other mammal. You just need different genes.
> Cheese made from engineered human breast milk may not sound like a top
> seller at the deli counter. But the team says it can serve a practical
> purpose: Human milk cheese could offer an option to people who have
> allergies to non-human dairy products. (Chavez said the group has put
> its experiments with human milk on hold due to Food and Drug
> Administration concerns about possible autoimmune reactions.)
>
> They also hope to engineer cheese based on the milk of the narwhal,
> the most outlandish mammal they could imagine. They hear the milk has
> the consistency of toothpaste.
