Its good your brought this subject up like a revisit.\
The country probably has a very small primary industry.\
It looks like Google has rejected there site (not to sure yet). They
sell just about anything related to do with computers.\
There site is massive and it has improved over time and has valid email
address\'s for contact. Unlike some of the sites.\
\
If I want to buy things online now, I run a web portal on the site of
interest with the category I need as a start point then they are easier
to locate the bargains.\
In (/IndexSchema\_p.html) there is some settings that may help.
