Would you like to supersize that for a dollar extra?

How many more roadblocks can these companies throw between them and
their customers\' money?

Back in the 90s, a friend was the engineer at Amazon who built One Click
Ordering. It was a pretty nice time-saving innovation (though in no way
deserving of [patent
protection](https://www.google.com/patents/US5960411)). He tells me that
internally they referred to it as \"The Money Vacuum\", and joked about
the day, soon, when all US currency would be replaced with Amazon gift
certificates.

So if you\'re buying a physical object from Amazon, and you\'re already
logged in, here\'s how that works, even today:

1.  Click \"Buy\".

No complaints there.

Oh, but if you want to buy a digital album, a whopping 100 MB spread
across 10 files? Here\'s how that goes:

1.  Over on the right where it used to say \"Buy\", now it says \"Go
    Unlimited\". I imagine [some
    people](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/01/things-real-people-dont-say-about-advertising/)
    find that self-explanatory, but I don\'t know what it means and I
    don\'t care. Click the small text link at the bottom that says
    \"More options\".
2.  Click the button that says \"Buy MP3 Album\".
3.  A dialog box pops up: \"We are processing your order, please wait
    out this artifical 10 second delay.\"
4.  A new dialog box replaces it: Click the button that says \"Download
    your music now\".
5.  Another dialog box! On this one, ignore the buttons and click the
    microscopic text at the bottom that says \"No thanks, just download
    music files directly\".
6.  Dialog box number four! \"Your download will start automatically \--
    please sit here and stare at this screen for another artificial 10
    second delay.\"

BONUS ROUND!

7.  Except that 30% of the time it will instead say, \"There was a
    problem with your download.\" When that happens: Aimlessly wander
    around the screen for a while until you can figure out how to get
    into the music archive thingy. Maybe it\'s under \"Departments →
    Amazon Music → Amazon Music Unlimited\"? Nope, that\'s not it,
    that\'s an ad.
8.  Maybe it\'s \"Departments → Amazon Music → Prime Music\"? Nope,
    another ad.
9.  Maybe it\'s \"Departments → Amazon Music → Open Web Player\"? Which
    spawns a new browser window. Yeah, that\'s it.
10. Now click \"Recents → Added\".
11. Now multi-select *each track* of the album that you just bought.
12. *Now* click the \"Download\" button.

SO EASY!

They should totally patent \"Seven to Twelve Click Purchasing\". It\'s
the next big thing, I\'m telling you.

And hey, let\'s contrast that with the insane up-sell that you have to
sit through every time you upgrade iOS:

1.  Settings → General → Software Update.
2.  \"Install\".
3.  \"Yes, I am sure\".
4.  \"Yes, I accept the license that I have not and will never read\".
5.  Wait, like, an hour.
6.  Unlock your device.
7.  Click \"Continue\".
8.  Decline to type in your Apple ID password, because this step is
    *completely unnecessary* \-- the password is still saved on the
    phone!
9.  Click \"Yes I am sure.\"
10. Click \"Turn off iCloud Drive\". Note that this is a *lie* because
    it was never *turned on* in the first place.
11. Do I click \"Cancel\" or \"Continue\"? Which one means \"fuck off\"?
    I think it is \"Continue\".
12. Click \"Don\'t share analytics\".
13. Click \"Get started!\" Hey, you know what would have been a better
    way for me to get started than clicking on \"Get started!\"? I\'d
    say, *not* clicking on \"Get started!\"

What did the computer say in that *Black Mirror* episode? \"Your eyes
must be open while viewing this commercial, or penalties will apply\".
