Wunschliste â€¢ Whitelist
=======================

Date: 2014-10-14 15:23:25

Hi,\
i really get too much crap into my index by other peers. Blacklisting is
nice depending on what role you want to give to your server. I would
like to narrow it down a lot. I failed to use Regex for \"exclude
beside\" aka whitelisting.\
With a whitelist i could still exchange DHTs -\> Robinson with DHT\
\
Maybe there could be the option of having a whitelist? It would be a
nice feature (at last for me)
