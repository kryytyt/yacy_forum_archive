> Behold the Camden Bench. This pale, amorphous lump of sculpted
> concrete is designed to resist almost everything in a city that it
> might come into contact with. Named for the London authority that
> commissioned it, the Camden Bench has a special coating which makes it
> impervious to graffiti and vandalism. The squat, featureless surface
> gives drug dealers nowhere to hide their secret caches. The angled
> sides repel skateboarders and flyposters, litter and rain. The
> cambered top throws off rough sleepers. In fact, it is specially
> crafted to make sure that it is not used as anything except a bench.
> This makes it a strange artifact, defined far more by what it is not
> than what it is. The Camden Bench is a concerted effort to create a
> non-object.
>
> As such, the Camden Bench is a strange kind of architectural null
> point. A piece of the city that by design will not interact with it in
> any way. It is a bench by the slimmest of margins \-- hardly
> comfortable, affording none of the qualities that would make it more
> than simply a place to sit. This is the bench\'s sole concession to
> being part of the city, and it does it with the least conviction
> possible.
>
> I\'d like to see what the Camden Bench would look like if it didn\'t
> have to be a bench \-- if that final design constraint was removed,
> what would it become? Just some nebulous lump of concrete? Would it
> shrink or grow? Would it even be visible, or would it exist as a space
> hidden behind a physical wrinkle in the map? The Camden non-Bench
> would be like a hard pearl in the mouth of an oyster, of the city but
> not part of the city, just an inert lump.
