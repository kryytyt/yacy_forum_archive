New keyboard
============

Date: 2015-03-13 20:55:48

I switched from a [Kinesis
Freestyle2](https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-for-mac/) to a
[Matias Ergo Pro](http://matias.ca/ergopro/pc/), and I\'m pretty happy
with it! It feels much more solid. The springs feel a lot like the old
Kinesis Evolution (which is to say, \"like springs, not bubble wrap\"),
and it\'s a lot quieter.

I ordered it almost a year ago, and it only just arrived.

There aren\'t a lot of options for two piece, separated keyboards.

Things I like about the Matias:

-   The connecting cable is removable. The Kinesis was hardwired, and
    wasn\'t as long as I liked. The cable that comes with the Matias is
    also kind of short, but it\'s just a standard 3.5mm 4-conductor
    cable, so that\'s a [cheap
    fix](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FJEGXLW/).
-   The bottom row is much taller, and **Ctrl** is wider.
-   **Esc** is tall and awesome and in the right place, so I don\'t keep
    hitting **`` `~ ``** by mistake.
-   The Delete Forward key is banished off to the **Fn** row, which is
    great because now I can stop hitting it by accident all the time.
-   Right-Shift doesn\'t have **â†‘** to the right of it begging to be hit
    by mistake.
-   The bank of function keys on the left is smaller, which is nice
    because I never used those anyway.
-   **Fn** is a chord instead of **FnLock**, so you have to hold it down
    to switch between function keys and media keys. I\'m on the fence
    about this but I think I like it.

Do Not Want:

-   Separated keyboards are supposed to have **`6^`** on both sides! The
    Matias has it only on the right. This is horrible. It is literally
    ruining my life.
-   **Opt** is only on the left side, instead of on both sides. **Cmd**
    is on both, but really I want all three on both sides.
-   There\'s a **NumLock** key to the left on the **N** that turns the
    right side into a numeric keypad. I hit it by mistake all the time
    and then v50 c6. 64 352 5 6 53. 5\' 250 6 .050.
-   Guess what keycode the **Paste** key sends? If you guessed **Paste**
    you\'d be wrong. It sends **Cmd-V** and Emacs sheds a single tear.
-   For some reason [USB Overdrive](http://www.usboverdrive.com/)
    doesn\'t recognize it as a keyboard at all, so I can\'t remap any of
    its keys.

Still, it\'s an improvement overall.
