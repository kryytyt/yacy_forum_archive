I think too, a standard war distribution would be a nice option\
and tackled it once in a while.\
But as it includes major rewirte of existing features, I\'m not sure if
it is worse while the effort.\
The development is likely only feasible as separate branch with not much
chance to be joined together later, splitting possibly the available
development resources.\

Simply, because there is no way easy way of getting this done (at least
I don\'t see it).\
\
I probably would join the club to make it work, once a starter skeleton
is defined. But I see other things which would benefit the main
target/user group more.\
But still, for spreading YaCy it would be a nice/additional option and
imho, the way to go (compared to httpd module).
