[![](http://www.jwz.org/images/1259446742039331363.jpg)The reason you
should boycott bottled water is because it enables a bullshit, backwards
vision for
society.](http://gizmodo.com/stop-drinking-bottled-water-1704609514)

> Boycotting bottled water means you support the idea that public access
> to clean, safe water is not only a basic human right, but that it\'s a
> goddamn technological triumph worth protecting. It means you believe
> that ensuring public access to this resource is the only way to
> guarantee it will be around in a few more years.
>
> Clean, safe drinking water that flows freely out of our faucets is a
> feat of engineering that humans have been been perfecting for two
> millennia. It is a cornerstone of civilization. It is what our cities
> are built upon. And over the years the scientists and hydrologists and
> technicians who help get water to our houses have also become our
> environmental stewards, our infrastructural watchdogs, our urban
> visionaries. Drinking the water these people supply to our homes is
> the best possible way to protect future access to water worldwide.
>
> Companies that package water in a single-use bottle are not concerned
> with the future. They are not invested in the long-term effects of
> climate change on an endangered watershed, nor are they working to
> prepare a megacity for an inevitable natural disaster. What they are
> interested in is their bottom line: Marketing a \"healthy\" product to
> compensate for the fact that people are buying less of their other
> products that are known to case obesity and diabetes \-- and selling
> it for at prices that are 240 to 10,000 times higher than what you pay
> for tap water.
