It looks like in the end your upgrade to Java 1.8 didn\'t solve the
problem related to the too many files open\... At least I think this is
the key problem in the trace you report, as for example the error
\"Exception during facet.field: coordinate\_p\" is normally not a
blocking one.\
I will try to dig again in that direction to find an eventual fix\...
unfortunately this kind of issue takes some non negligible time to test.
