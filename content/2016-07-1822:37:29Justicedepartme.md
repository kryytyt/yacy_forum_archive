> FOIA requests to the FBI are processed by searching the Automated Case
> Support system (ACS), a software program that celebrates its 21st
> birthday this year.
>
> Not only are the records indexed by ACS inadequate, Shapiro told the
> Guardian, but the FBI refuses to search the full text of those records
> as a matter of policy. When few or no records are returned, Shapiro
> said, the FBI effectively responds \"sorry, we tried\" without making
> use of the much more sophisticated search tools at the disposal of
> internal requestors.
>
> \"The FBI\'s assertion is akin to suggesting that a search of a
> limited and arbitrarily produced card catalogue at a vast library is
> as likely to locate book pages containing a specified search term as a
> full text search of database containing digitized versions of all the
> books in that library,\" Shapiro said.
>
> The DoJ has contended to Shapiro and others that only one of ACS\'s
> three search functions, the Universal Name Index (UNI), is necessary
> to fulfill the law. The UNI search does not include the text of the
> files in the ACS, merely search terms entered \-- or not \-- by the
> FBI agent handling the case in question.
>
> Shapiro told the Guardian that the reason the DoJ gave for refusing to
> use its \$425m Sentinel software to process FOIA requests after ACS
> had failed to recover records was that a Sentinel search \"would be
> needlessly duplicative of the FBI\'s default ACS UNI index-based
> searches and wasteful of Bureau resources\". \[\...\]
>
> The FBI\'s chief technology officer during the second George W Bush
> administration, Jack Israel, \[\...\] said four years ago. \"It\'s
> based on an IBM mainframe with legacy database and programming
> technology, and I would say one of the main things that strikes you as
> a user of ACS is that you\'re dealing with the old IBM green screens.
> You\'re not dealing with a web-based environment, which everyone is
> used to from the internet.\"
