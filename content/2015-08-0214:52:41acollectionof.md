``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
a collection of search query enhancements:
- fixed superfluous space in query field list
- fixed filter query logic
- removed look-ahead query which caused that each new search page
submitted two solr queries
- fixed random solr result orders in case that the solr score was equal:
this was then re-ordered by YaCy using the document hash which came from
the solr object and that appeared to be random. Now the hash of the url
is used and the score is additionally modified by the url length to
prevent that this particular case appears at all.
```
