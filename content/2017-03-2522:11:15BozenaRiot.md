> BOZENA RIOT is a remotely operated, armored vehicle designed to handle
> riots and mobs in the streets and urbanized areas. The system offers a
> solution for both protecting the law-enforcement units in action and
> controlling the situation whenever peace maintenance is required.
>
> High pressure tear gas guns guarantee control of crowds in extreme
> situations. And the high-tech video system means every moment is
> captured from all angles.
