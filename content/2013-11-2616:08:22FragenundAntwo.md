As far as I know, yacy runs smoother under unix-based operating systems
(like linux and mac osx). Maybe yould think about switching. Linux mint
works well with yacy, and it\'s free and easy to handle for ex-windows
users. I\'m using it on my own computers. <http://www.linuxmint.com/>\

I found by installing JAVA version 6 u 26 then 7 u25 it runs real smooth
on P4 3 G unless its index time. YaCa is About 2% of CPU time at normal
operation on Windows XP desktop PC.
