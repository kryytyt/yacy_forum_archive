> Klockars blacksmith shop on Rincon Hill has endured as an obvious
> contrast of the old San Francisco and the new, a blue-collar relic
> amid sleek residential towers. But if plans now in the works bear
> fruit, the two-story wood structure from 1912 will be a symbol of
> transition all on its own \-- from a place where metalwork is forged
> to a nook where marijuana is consumed.
>
> \"Tony\'s not going to be here forever, and there aren\'t a line of
> blacksmiths waiting in line to take over,\" said Travis Kelly, the
> grandson of Tony Rosellini, who has operated the blacksmith shop
> pretty much on his own since 1970. \"This way, at least we can
> preserve the building into the future.\"
>
> The building is owned by Rosellini\'s ex-wife, the daughter of Edwin
> Klockars, who died in 1994 at the age of 96. The family has never had
> interest in selling despite the offers that routinely come their way.
>
> With his grandmother\'s blessing, Kelly and investors have filed a
> proposal with the city to restore the structure and bring it up to
> code \-- no mean feat given the dirt floors in the back and an airy
> tin roof. The new function would be a cannabis dispensary, for now
> called \"The Weedsmith.\"
>
> \"The old machines, the wide-plank redwood floors, we\'d want to keep
> it all and preserve the atmosphere,\" said Kelly, 29, an attorney who
> grew up in Burlingame. \"We\'d want something high-end, like a Sephora
> or an Apple Store.\" \[\...\]
>
> There was a time here when a blacksmith\'s shop was nothing special,
> especially in a part of town where small operators were part of the
> industrial bustle. But Klockars is the only one left, a designated
> city landmark with 20 stories of condominiums on one side, a massive
> electrical substation on the other, and a 55-story tower going up
> across the street.
>
> \"It\'s kind of cold already,\" Rosellini, 86, said one afternoon last
> week. \"Now it\'s going to be shady, too.\"
>
> Rosellini lives in South San Francisco, and most days his exercise
> consists of long, slow walks at the mall. But he still comes in one or
> two days a week, firing up the forge and making the hooks used to lift
> manhole covers, or prongs, or pry bars.
>
> Nothing glamorous.
>
> The affable blacksmith loves to tell how he entered the trade: \"I was
> married to the boss\' daughter, I got fired somewhere else, and my
> wife said, \'You better give Tony a job.\'\" That was in 1960. A
> decade late, Edwin Klockars was ready to retire.
>
> \"I took over the business,\" Rosellini said with a laugh, then
> gestured at the spare tools and dusty keepsakes piled high in every
> direction. \"I never made any money. But all this junk is mine.\"
