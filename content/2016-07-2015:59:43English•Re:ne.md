Thanks for the tips, too.\
\
We are still trying to find a strong, reliable solution to\
NEW PAGE =FAILED. REASON: EXIST-TEST FAILED: ERROR EXECUTING\
1) \> the issue of new pages reporting incorrectly at known 1st crawl,
hence initial crawling being stopped \[as described above\] and\
\
2) previously harvested, and what were functional DATA sets non being
readable when moved to fresh a YaCy\
\
I am wondering if it is needed to reinstall the same -by now- older
version / generation of YaCy to achieve readability?\
It was my understanding that this was not required.\
\
We have many large, older DATA sets after several years of cloud based
harvesting and now we to \'mount\' the older data sets and use them.\
\
Many thanks for your expertise!
