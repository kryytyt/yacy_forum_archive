> Yes, these monuments were put up to honor Confederate leaders. But the

> They were mostly built during times when Southern whites were engaged
> in vicious campaigns of subjugation against blacks, and during those
> campaigns the message sent by a statue of Robert E. Lee in front of a
> courthouse was loud and clear.

> No one should think that these statues were meant to be somber
> postbellum reminders of a brutal war. They were built much later, and
> most of them were explicitly created to accompany organized and
> violent efforts to subdue blacks and maintain white supremacy in the
> South. I wouldn\'t be surprised if even a lot of Southerners don\'t
> really understand this, but they should learn. There\'s a reason
> blacks consider these statues to be symbols of bigotry and terror.
> It\'s because they are.
