Support parsing gzip files from servers with redundant headers.

Some web servers provide both 'Content-Encoding : "gzip"' and
'Content-Type : "application/x-gzip"' HTTP headers on their ".gz" files.
This was annoying to fail on such resources which are not so uncommon,
while non conforming (see RFC 7231 section 3.1.2.2 for
"Content-Encoding" header specification
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.2.2)
```
