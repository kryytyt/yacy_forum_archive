Add a configurable limit to tags initially displayed in search results

When the limit is reached, a button allow expanding/collapsing remaining
tags.

When this feature is activated without a limit to the number of
displayed tags, when encountering search results with a very large
number of keywords, the results page can become almost unusable (very
long vertical scrollbar)
