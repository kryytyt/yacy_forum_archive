English â€¢ Has anyone ever tuned Java for YaCy.
==============================================

I started to watch a few videos on the tube and realized if you have a
large machine it might need help tuning Java to suit. There are lots of
command line options.\
\
Seek professional help, I think the email address is present at the peer
shutdown page.\

I am experimenting with some settings and I have noticed my machine
sometimes goes wild on the swap partition, I usually hit the reset on
the machine and am unsure of the exact cause.
