They had some cool lighting instruments: two grids of individually
addressable LEDs, 4096 total, I think. They mostly just ran sweeps but
there were a few volumetric effects too. Basically the Bay Bridge lights
but with depth.

Also I liked her 50s space-girl outfit.

But when that\'s all I remember about a show\... sigh. It\'s hard to see
the point of seeing a singer-plus-producer act at a large venue. They
sounded exactly, totally, 100% like the CD. Much of the vocal track was
canned, too. There wasn\'t really a performance. I saw them at Bottom of
the Hill and it was basically the same show, lights aside, except that
this time I was watching it from two blocks away and couldn\'t amuse
myself by mentally reverse-engineering the drum-trigger pods.
