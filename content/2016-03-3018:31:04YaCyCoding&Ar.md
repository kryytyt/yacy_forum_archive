YaCy Coding & Architecture • Re: Java Web Start launch alternative
==================================================================

Date: 2016-03-30 18:31:04

Hello, thank you very much for reviewing, that\'s encouraging!\
\
Yes the only purpose of all changes I made on my branch was to allow
launching through a single runnable jar and then through Java Web Start.
My ultimate goal would eventually to allow launching YaCy as a browser
embedded applet.\
Most of the work is only refactoring on resources loading : the idea is
to load necessary resources as classpath resources URLs instead of
relative or absolute file paths.\
I also modified icon tray enabled/disabled conditions for linux because
user also need feedback on this OS when YaCy is not launched as a
service.\
\
Before merging to main branch there are still non regressions tests to
run with classical ditribution and OS dependant installers. I think some
modifications are still to be done at least in pom.xml (htroot,
defaults, lang, and other resources should only be included in the new
all-in-one runnable jar, and kept out of yacycore.jar as currently done
in main distribution).\
\
I will try to finalize these tests as soon as possible. If you have some
other questions don\'t hesitate!
