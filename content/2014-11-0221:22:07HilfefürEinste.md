ok, sorry about the late answer.\
\
Here\'s what\'s happening from the server cpu consumption standpoint:\

\
The issue I initially reported is clearly visible in the green (Nice CPU
usage) spike.\
\
Late in the evening, I decide to reboot the server with shutdown -r. I
expected that this command would shutdown Yacy with service yacy stop,
since my Yacy client startup/shutdown is automated by a LSB Init
script.\
\
But it wouldn\'t stop after half an hour. So I decided to force the
server shutdown with my finger.\
\
When I restarted the server, it tried to start Yacy automatically, but
it didn\'t succeed.\
\
Today, I manually simulated an attempt to start Yacy by issueing ./
startYACY -d \> logyacy, and the log and screen output are:\
\
1 - Log -

\
2 - screen output -
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8FDexrYy_FKNkRSalVPbnU2S2s/view?usp=sharing>\
\
What should I do?
