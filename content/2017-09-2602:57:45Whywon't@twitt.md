As far as I can tell, the account complies 100% with the random crap in
that \"Help\" article.

Especially hateful is the fact that replies to this email are
blackholed. There seems to be no mechanism to ask \"WHY?\", which is
presumably by design. And then they make you wait another month before
submitting again, with \"But WHY?\" appended to your request.

\"At this time\" my ass.
