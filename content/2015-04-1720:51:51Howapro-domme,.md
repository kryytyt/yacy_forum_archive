[In 1978, the CIA was caught up in a BDSM Cold War
affair.](https://medium.com/cuepoint/cia-allegedly-behind-1980s-club-hit-about-sleeping-dominatrix-66508c6581bf)

> A potential Soviet asset had fallen for a professional dominatrix who
> made decent money peeing on entertainment lawyers. Also in play was
> Mary Tyler Moore\'s landscaper, merely because he was sweet on the
> dominatrix and her record collection.
>
> The most actionable intelligence from these black leather ops would
> not be obtained by the Agency, but by the landscaper himself, Stuart
> Argabright. Under the alias Dominatrix, Argabright recorded *\"The
> Dominatrix Sleeps Tonight,\"* a New York club hit released in 1984.
> \[\...\]
>
> This all started like so many high-school dreams: with no wheels and
> dumb luck. In 1977, Argabright was picked up while hitchhiking back
> home on the Key Bridge crossing the Potomac from Washington, D.C. He
> was 18, wearing a Tubes T-shirt and had just won tickets to see the
> Stooges. He was six years away from borrowing Iggy Pop\'s swim trunks
> in West Berlin, and seven from Dominatrix turning Iggy and Bowie\'s
> \"Play It Safe\" into a post-punk seizure.
>
> The woman driving was older, and her red Corvette Stingray smelled of
> spy perfume. \[\...\] They began seeing each other, spending nights at
> her East Side apartment, getting high and listening to Bowie records.
> After Argabright noticed the bull whips and manacles hanging in the
> closet, it became apparent that his friend\'s occupation entailed
> visiting all manner of welt and contusion upon the no-account hides of
> wealthy degenerates.
>
> They soon compared clientele: He had Dylan, Paul Simon and Rock
> Hudson. She had music executives and a Russian official in D.C., who
> apparently had been beaten senseless enough to fall in love, with
> ambitions of defection and marriage. (\"But a dominatrix doesn\'t
> often entertain marriage thoughts,\" says Argabright.) Always game for
> defection, the CIA contacted the dominatrix and encouraged her to
> \"play ball.\" She reluctantly agreed while continuing to make the
> landscaper late for his mulching appointments on the Upper West Side.
> \[\...\]
>
> \"The Dominatrix Sleeps Tonight\" was recorded in the studio of
> Tangerine Dream\'s Peter Bauman, with vocalist Claudia Summers, Ken
> Lockie of Public Image, Ltd., and Bow Wow Wow remixer Ivan Ivan.
> \[\...\] One imagines the boys at Langley picking up this 12-inch and
> adding it to the Argabright-Argabright folder, somewhere between
> \"weeded Paul Simon\'s periwinkle bed\" and \"shared stage with Klaus
> Nomi.\" Not to mention those gigs with Rammellzee, G.G. Allin, and
> good lord, Max Headroom. Best keep that tab open.
