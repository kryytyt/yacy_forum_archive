Money Quote:

> The tension has been exacerbated by an increasing financial dependence

> over black motorists at a greater rate than whites. In 2013, Ferguson,
> with a population of about 21,000, had the highest number of arrest
> warrants --- often served by municipal courts when someone fails to

> warrants per 1,000 people**.

Wie krass ist DAS denn?!
