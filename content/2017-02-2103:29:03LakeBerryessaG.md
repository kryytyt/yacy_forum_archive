I have visited the [Whiskeytown Glory
Hole](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.6001445,-122.5365847,216m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en)
but I didn\'t realize [we had one closer to
home](https://www.google.com/maps/@38.5120622,-122.1053158,237a,42.6y,0.78t/data=!3m1!1e3).

Which reminds me that I have yet to drop a video camera down the chute
and into my building\'s trash compactor.
