English â€¢ YaCy equivalent of Solr\'s debugQuery?
================================================

Date: 2014-05-31 09:44:48

In Solr, you can use the debugQuery field to get information on how each
result\'s ranking was calculated:
[https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrReleva \...
22wings.22](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrRelevancyFAQ#Why_does_id:archangel_come_before_id:hawkgirl_when_querying_for_.22wings.22){.postlink}\
\
Is something similar available for YaCy\'s ranking? I\'d really like to
be able to get YaCy results and see how the ranking was calculated (both
Solr and RWI).
