[![](https://www.jwz.org/images/c8h9ymnxyaaponz.jpg)But, you might be
asking yourself, \"What in the hell was anyone even thinking trying to
stick a radioisotope generator into a human being\'s chest
cavity?\"](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/the-true-story-of-the-government-programs-that-tried-to-build-an-atomic-heart/274266/)

> Fair question. If you take the goal for an artificial heart to be the
> true replacement of the human heart in perpetuity, then power becomes
> a primary concern, trumping all other engineering constraints. When
> contractors like Westinghouse Electric and McDonnell-Douglas offered
> bids for the government work, they made sure to note the atomic
> solution as the only possibility.
