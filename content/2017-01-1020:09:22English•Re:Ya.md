Hi marcdraco, dont\' hesitate to update the wiki instructions with your
own experience.\
\
Regarding Java efficiency : IMHO performance issues are not so much tied
to a programming language or another\... Solr or ElasticSearch are
examples of Java projects dedicated to indexing and are not really
exotic choices for these tasks. What\'s more adopting Java has other
advantages than portability, one example can be its extended core
library (the JDK).\
\
But of course, in a better world there would be multiple implementations
of YaCy concepts in many languages
