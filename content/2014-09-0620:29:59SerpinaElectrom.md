[\"Dust on the seesaw destroys the
theory.\"](http://holzmechanik.de/serpina_eng.html)

> These clocks are working without a pendulum. Instead of the pendulum a
> ball is rolling down an inclined plane, for which it takes 20 seconds.
> Then the Seesaw tends to the opposite direction and the process begins
> again.
>
> This clock type is relatively unknown although the first examples were
> built in the 17th century. Serpina was inspired by the design of Sir
> William Congreve from the early 19th century.
>
> Rolling ball clocks are primarily great entertainers. Although Galileo
> Galilei already discovers, that a ball needs on an inclined plane
> always the same time for the same distance. In practice, however, all
> rolling ball clocks have a problem with the accuracy, because dust on
> the seesaw destroys the theory.
