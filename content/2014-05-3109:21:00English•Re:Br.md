Personally I wouldn\'t want the HTTP header to determine what results I
get. I think it would be reasonable for YaCy to support a set of
configurable \"default languages\" so that if I choose French and
English as my default languages, YaCy should automatically include those
constraints on searches unless I choose otherwise for that specific
search. It would also be fine with me if YaCy detected my HTTP header
languages the first time I used it, and asked me if I wanted to use
those as the default languages for future searches.
