English â€¢ Re: No remote results in peer-to-peer mode
====================================================

Date: 2017-06-29 21:22:37

After I downloaded and configured Yacy on an empty index and after I
started a crawler job, I realized that remote results weren\'t
displayed. (the \"remote\" counter in the search page remained at 0).\
Since then I continued to consistently not receive remote results if the
system load was high (\> \~10), even the following day, up until I set
those \"maxload\" options as explained.\
\
With \"background processes\" I mean processes running on the same
computer which are unrelated to Yacy.
