town mayor relinquishes electronics and passwords to agents at
SFO](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/small-town-mayor-relinquishes-electronics-and-passwords-to-agents-at-sfo/)

> Stockton, California Mayor Anthony R. Silva attended a recent mayor\'s
> conference in China, but his return trip took a bit longer than usual.
> At the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) this week, agents
> with the Department of Homeland Security detained Silva and
> confiscated his personal cell phone among other electronics. According
> to comments from the mayor, that may not even be the most alarming
> part.
>
> \"Unfortunately, they were not willing or able to produce a search
> warrant or any court documents suggesting they had a legal right to
> take my property,\" Silva told SFGate. \"In addition, they were
> persistent about requiring my passwords for all devices.\"
>
> The mayor\'s attorney, Mark Reichel, told SFGate that Silva was not
> allowed to leave the airport without forfeiting his passwords. Reichel
> was not present for Silva\'s interaction with the DHS agents, either.
> The mayor was told he had \"no right for a lawyer to be present\" and
> that being a US citizen did not \"entitle me to rights that I probably
> thought,\" according to the paper.

*(Also, \"rights\" by definition are not \"entitlements\", you
illiterate motherfuckers. If you\'ve sworn to uphold the Constitution
and you can\'t explain the difference between rights and privileges,
maybe you don\'t deserve its protection either.)*
