While I constantly try to keep the memory and CPU demand low (I partly
develop and test on a 2006 macbook) there might be use cases for very
large memory demands. Memory may speed up search performance and it will
ensure the capability for large indexes while the p2p architecture
ensures unlimites scalability.\
Which means: \@fherb is right demanding a non-high-cpu-ram ability
favoring p2p technology while \@netsearch is right to enlarge his
capability for high load/high document number.\
I really like tests on such string hardware because it will tighten the
professional application of YaCy. It is costly to do such tests and it
is very valuable to have such users and their experience reports here.\
The other end of the performance options is hardware like RaspberryPi
which I also would like to see as a YaCy plattform. But it is not right
to demand that YaCy should be made for a single way of configuration and
a \'typical\' class of home computers.
