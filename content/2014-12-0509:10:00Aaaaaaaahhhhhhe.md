[![](http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/src/slideshow/colorbars.jpg)](http://www.dnalounge.com/webcast/)Since
we still have no video webcast, Streamup continuing to be nonfunctional
approximately 100% of the time, I had a stupid idea: I\'ll webcast
*silently* through Youtube Live, so those [pigfuckers won\'t Content-ID
me](http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2014/09/03.html), and then do
audio playback from the MP3 webcast.

Downside: there\'s not even a remote chance that audio and video will
ever be in sync. Upside: by not using Streamup, there\'s a chance that
there might sometimes be any video at all.

But now I can\'t figure out what the hell I did last time to get video
into Youtube at all. FMLE is chugging away, telling me that it has been
connected for 26 minutes, but the Youtube \"Live Control Room\" keeps
saying \"We are not receiving data from your encoder\".
FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU\...
