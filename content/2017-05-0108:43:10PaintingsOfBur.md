[Alex Shaeffer: *Disaster
Capitalism:*](http://www.mutantspace.com/alex-shaeffer-paintings-burning-banks-disaster-capitalism/)

> Alex Schaefer set up an easel across the road from a Chase bank and
> began painting the building in flames. However, before he had finished
> the police arrived, asked him for his information and if he was
> planning on actually carrying out an arson attack on the building.
> Later they turned up on his doorstep asking about his artwork and
> looking for any signs that he was going to carry through an
> anarcho-terrorist plot based on his paintings. \[\...\]
>
> > Homeland Security considers drawing or photographing \"sensitive\"
> > locations and buildings is suspicious activity. But my painting
> > protest is different because it\'s so slow and blatant. I was not
> > \"casing\" the location. I was standing on the street in full view
> > painting for four hours, talking with people, interacting. I suspect
> > it was someone from the bank that notified authorities that they are
> > \"threatened\" by my painting. And that was the exact word the
> > police used when first confronting me. Someone was \"threatened\" by
> > my art and called them.
> >
> > Once it was sketched out I started immediately with the flames.
> > \[\...\] The reaction of everyone who commented was positive. Thumbs
> > up. \[People would say\] \"They suck.\" \"they screwed my checking
> > account,\" \"my brother\'s losing his home.\" I could feel that the
> > image was a catharsis for lots of people. Three hours into it the
> > police came and the rest is history.
