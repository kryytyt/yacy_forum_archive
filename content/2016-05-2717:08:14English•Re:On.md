English â€¢ Re: Only get 20 results from API
==========================================

Hi, I was thinking and just tested another workaround (maybe a bit late)
: if your intend is to get json results coming only from your peer
index, another solution is to use directly embedded solr api. Of course
the output format won\'t be the same as yacysearch servlet, but this way
is reliable to get ALL results, with page size up to 100, starting at
any page.\
\
Thus your inital query :\

Code: 
:   `curl "http://youhost:8090/yacysearch.json?query=my+url-encoded+query&maximumRecords=200&resource=local"`

\
\
could be translated to :\

Code: 
:   `curl "http://youhost:8090/solr/select?q=my+url-encoded+query&wt=json&start=0&rows=100&core=collection1"`

\
\
and you may loop, increasing start by 100 on each step, or jump directly
to the page you wish.
