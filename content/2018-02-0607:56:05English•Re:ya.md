Ah great, a French project wishing to use YaCy?\
\
I suggested you to have a look at the DidYouMean class implementation,
because it is the class normally involved in suggesting terms both in
the top of the /yacysearch.html results page, and in the /suggest.json
API. You can try the API for example with
<https://doc.ouahpiti.info/suggest.json?query=remina&count=10> and you
will see it provides some indexed entries.\
\
So why doesn\'t it work in your search results page? I have to dig and
test a little bit more the question, but I found a first reason :
DidYouMean can currently not be called in the Web Portal Mode (your
running mode I guess), but only in P2P mode when the RWI index is
enabled. This is apparently the result of the various modifications that
occurred on the suggestions implementations, but it should now probably
fixed.\
I will try to have a look at this soon and push a fix on GitHub if it is
conclusive.
