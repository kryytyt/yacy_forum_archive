Erik\_S,\

I created a web forward to your url it did not work at first so I did
one other action then it worked.\
\
Is it possible for you to create a random list and then step thru them
one by one because while I was testing I hit 1 server 4 times out of
64?\
\
Some are very slow in loading the search page even one dead,
search.yacy.de loads in 1.8 seconds.\
\
It might be a good idea if you have a list of subscribers that users can
register with you if they want to be on the random list.
