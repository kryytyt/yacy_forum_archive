We don not have a simple tool which can do that. It would be necessary
to merge two Solr indexes which is possible, see
<http://wiki.apache.org/solr/MergingSolrIndexes>\
But there is a lot of organization around to do that. We would need a
simple function in the web pages to do the merge automatically but we
don\'t have this now.
