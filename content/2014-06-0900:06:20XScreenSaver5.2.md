XScreenSaver 5.29
=================

Date: 2014-06-09 00:06:20

[XScreenSaver 5.29 out now](http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/). The DMG
of this version should work again on MacOS 10.6 and 10.7. I had to
downgrade to Xcode 5.0.2 to make that work, because Apple are jerks.

I have had two people report, with previous versions, that the
auto-updater appeared to run the installer but then didn\'t actually
install anything. If you can reproduce that, please let me know.
