> However, there is good news - while Caterpillar\'s revenues and cash

> According to the WSJ, Caterpillar is eager to reassure shareholders it
> won\'t get burned on equipment leased to customers in China even as
> the economy cools there. CAT Financial Services President Kent Adams
> said during a conference call on Tuesday that the company keeps tabs
> on the position of machinery electronically through its Product Link

> \"If a customer falls behind, we have the ability to derate the engine
> or turn the engine off, and we\'ve set up a legal presence in all of
> the provinces of China.\"
>
> In other words, any and all Chinese lessors who fall behind on their
> payments will suddenly find their excavator\'s engine shut down and no
> longer operable, stuck in the middle of a mine, quarry, or
> construction site with a paperweight weighing dozens of tons.
