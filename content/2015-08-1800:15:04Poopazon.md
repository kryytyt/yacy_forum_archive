> Even more alarming was the bathroom culture. I can only speak to the

> The most horrifying moment of my employment at Amazon was the time I

> to me. He asked me why I had not responded to his very pressing email.
> I closed my eyes and pretended this wasn\'t happening. What email
> could be so important that it could not wait five minutes for me to
> use the bathroom? He began tapping on the wall between our stalls,
> asking why I wouldn\'t respond, as if inter-stall conversation should
> be a totally normal, not disgusting means of communication.

> He became more specific about what he needed \-- referencing a project
> I\'d never heard of, nor would I ever have involvement in \-- and I
> realized he had misidentified me from my shoes. (Many brown dress
> shoes look alike, apparently.) We both exited our stalls around the
> same time, and he realized his mistake. He didn\'t apologize, only
> explained that he thought I was someone else. As we washed our hands,
> he just laughed, and I vowed I would never use the stalls on that
> floor again.
