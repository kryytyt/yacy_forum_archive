I\'ve installed the [Postmatic Social
Commenting](https://wordpress.org/plugins/postmatic-social-commenting/)
plugin on the jwz and DNA blogs, so now you can auth using Twitter,
Facebook or Google, rather than lying to me about your identities
*directly.* It seems to work pretty well. Let me know if you notice any
problems.
