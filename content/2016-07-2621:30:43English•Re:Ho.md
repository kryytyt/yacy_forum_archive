Hi, if craigslist ban anyone intending to crawl their sites, I am not
sure YaCy would currently help you\...\
However I suppose YaCy network could theorically do it, using \"global
crawl\" feature (see \"Do Remote Indexing\" on the bottom of the
CrawlStartExpert.html page on a running YaCy peer), but I fear currently
there are not so much YaCy peers accepting remote crawls, and also maybe
not enough peers running at the same time\...\
\
YaCy heuristics feature (/ConfigHeuristics\_p.html) could also help, but
it is designed to only configure some OpenSearch URLs which will fill
P2P search results with some more items, and won\'t be the only results
source.\
\
But maybe a Meta Search engine such as Searx could help you more\...
