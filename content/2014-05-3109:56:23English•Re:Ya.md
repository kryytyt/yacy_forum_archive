good point. You can of course use the Solr API in YaCy to get Solr query
results including debugQuery information but you point out that there is
no transparency in connection with RWI ranking and you are right. I will
see how I can add this in the same fashion as Solr does with debugQuery;
i.e. in the opensearch API
