Hi webbingbcn ,\
as said earlier in this thread YaCy is decentralized.\
So if you would like your content to be indexed and present in this p2p
network, I believe the best thing to do is to set up your own YaCy peer
and then crawl your own website! You can run YaCy in the so called
\"WebPortal\" mode if you want only to expose your own indexed content
and don\'t want to share some parts of the globally distributed index.\
Alternatively you can ask someone else to do so\...\
\
Best regards
