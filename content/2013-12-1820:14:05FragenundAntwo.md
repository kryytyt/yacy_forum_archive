My experiences are similar.\
\
When you have a very slow processor (like my ARM at RaspberryPi) so you
see the processor load around 100% and this is the bottleneck. Otherwise
look for your HDD io access. In Linux you can use iotop. Write access is
not so intensive. But read.\
\
When this HDD access brakes to much and the web reaction is in slow
motion following can help to make the system more stable: (I tried it on
a dual-core ARM system and a virtual server) Increase the busy-sleep
time of crawling and DHT distribution and set performanceIO to a higher
value. performanceIO is a %-value and said how much time is used for io
processes. So the system gets more time to work with the hard disk and
to answer on web front-end. I don\'t know if this is the best way, but
it seems to help when the system starts to lame. But, what you not get,
is a higher crawl and DHT distribution rate. Then you should think about
a faster HDD (SSD of course) or HDD-Interface when it is not the newest
one. But I\'m not sure if the costs for changing the hardware are in a
good relation to the benefit of YACY for your system.
