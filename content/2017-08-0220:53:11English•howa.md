Hi everyone,\
\
what if someone, creates a website.\
how this new website could be referenced by yacy-p2p-cloud ?\
\
The video \"Search Result Processing and Fraud Protection\" explain well
the internal process of searching some website and how the rank is
build.\
in my limited knowledge of Yacy, when we do a resarch the engine search
on (1) local cache database and (2) yacy-p2p database. It then create a
rank, and after that go get the real information directly to the ranked
websites then print the result.\
what if the website is neither on n°1 local cache nor the n°2 yacy-p2p
database ?\
in other words : how a unknown website enters into the yacy-p2p database
?\
in other words : what is the link between the creation of a new website
and its presence into one yacy search result ?\
\
thank you for your answers.
