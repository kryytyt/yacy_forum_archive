English â€¢ Re: How to get YACY working as a proxy
================================================

Thank you very kindly for your most interestingly detailed & educational
reply.\
I am concerned that the error was accidently - induced -, however, and
not the result of an environmental problem.\
It worked before.\
\
The server is in Robinson mode, one of 2 separate servers that read each
other but do not write to each other.\
Each server has its own collection of topic focused RSS instructions
that repeat daily or more frequently and individual URLs that are
inserted via \"Advanced Crawler\": items to ALSO crawl & index from the
open Internet.\
There is no intranet.\
\
Searches go to one of the servers, and to generate results, that
consults its own and the remote server solr files.\
\
The error comes, I believe, from a mistake I made in configuration of
the proxy choices. Lack of experience.\
Can you tell me please what is the file and where & how can I edit it to
the correct \'default\' setting?\
It worked before I made the mistaken proxy instruction change.\
\
Hence, the result of the error in configuration is as described before.
There is so little documentation on this issue. =Newbie problem\
You are so experienced in this. Perhaps you could pm me, please? Thank
you very kindly.
