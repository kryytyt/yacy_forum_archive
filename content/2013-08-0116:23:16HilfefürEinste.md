As in the topic, what is the host with the name
\"[central\_server](http://78.47.48.246:8090/Status.html){.postlink}\"?
It\'s such a strange one and in communication with it my YaCy starts
acting strangely. There are strange entries in the potential peers list
with the name of my peer, the ip address of that peer, and each with
diferent hash. After some time, there are hundreds of these entries.
Currently I filtered out its ip on firewall so such behavior does not
occur. Someone knows something about it or maybe seen similar behavior?
