> The 15-second ad triggers Google devices with the command, \"Ok
> Google, what is the Whopper burger?\" The spot will run nationally
> during primetime starting Wednesday \[\...\]
>
> Here\'s where we encountered the major flaw with Burger King\'s ad.
> Someone had edited the Whopper\'s Wikipedia page to say that the
> burger is made of a \"medium-sized child,\" instead of beef patty, and
> that it contains the toxic chemical Cyanide.
>
> Burger King later edited the Wikipedia page to a more accurate
> description of the burger. But people keep changing it.
>
> On Wednesday afternoon, the definition had been changed to: \"The
> Whopper is the worst hamburger product sold by the international
> fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise
> Hungry Jack\'s.\"
