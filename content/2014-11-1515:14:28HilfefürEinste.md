Hilfe für Einsteiger und Anwender • Status API question
=======================================================

Date: 2014-11-15 15:14:28

Does the information showing in
<http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8090/api/status_p.xml> apply only to the crawler
or does it also contain global status information?\
\
According to the API button description (in /Crawler\_p.html, from where
we load the status\_p.xml page), they refer only to the crawler status,
but some of the fields (if not most of them) seem to refer to global
values (like Disk Space, RAM, etc)\
\
I want to code a driver to parse that page and output some of the values
to Cacti, in order to graph them.\
\
Is there some kind of field description available for the fields that go
in that page?
