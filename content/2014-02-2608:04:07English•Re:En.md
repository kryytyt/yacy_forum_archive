You are right, there should be a default navigation setting which
selects the browser language to set a flag for the ranking. Documents in
the browser language can then be selected to have a higher ranking.\
\
My personal usage of search results has mostly no language preference,
they are either english or german. I usually prefer english results over
german if the content is just better. This is of course connected to the
fact that I am able to read and understand english.\
A language navigation also depends on the language recognition of the
parser, which was always a problem in the past. Lets see how the status
there is.\

If you register, then you can select the language for the registration
in the top right corner, see screenshot:\
select\_english\_in\_forum\_registration.png\
After you select \'english\' you also get a registration captcha
question in english language.
