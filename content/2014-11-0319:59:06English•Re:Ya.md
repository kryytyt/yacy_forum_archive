However the 500 Error Screens are still there and WE Cannot add URLs or
RSS links to work on.\
It only processes links it already has.\

We applied the current updates ( 1.81/9140 ) and things are better, but
the Error pages are still there.\
We must RECONNECT MANUALLY\...but HOW+WHERE, please????\
Thanks
