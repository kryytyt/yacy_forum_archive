I found the possibility to easily download and test a development
version a pretty good feature, helping none git users testing and using
the latest and greatest
![;)](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif "Wink")\
Sure, there is a risk to distribute a new introduced bug (but imho,
better figure it out early as not and in the past there were very few
real issues).\
\
As it looks like no updates of development 1.91 are available, should we
make some development releases available again for the update servlet ?\
\
P.S. if it is just a question of having a system run some build scripts
(and not intention to go with main releases only) \... I could share a
24/7 box doing it.
