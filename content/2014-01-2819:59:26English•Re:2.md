Yeah, because, yacy uses the port 8090 by default, so if you start a
peer the very first time it uses this port, but you can\'t run two peers
at the same time which are configured to use the same port.\
\
So you have to:\
1. Make sure all your yacys are shut down.\
2. Start the peer for which you want to use port 8091\
3. Open your web browser and go to the yacy \'basic configuration\'
page:\
<http://localhost:8090/ConfigBasic.html>\
4. Under \"peer port\" set the port 8091\
5. Click on \'set configuration\"\
6. Start the peer for which you want to use port 8090 (you don\'t have
to change the port settings, since the port 8090 is used by default.)
