lived in this brief, multi-decade state of grace, that ran roughly from
the demise of the cassette tape to about three years ago, when you could
be out and about in the world and be blissfully unaware of the shitty
musical taste of passing strangers. Pedestrians, bicyclists, commuters
on public transit: they were all aware of this amazing invention called
\"headphones\". Sure, there was the occasional gangsta in a car
impressing all the ladies with the phlegmatic buzzing snare of his door
panels, but mostly you could go days without hearing something terrible
squirted out of the tinniest excuses for speakers in the world.

What went wrong?

Now, every junkie and every fixie hipster is assaulting the world with
battery powered external speakers, and headphones are apparently no
longer a thing that exists. Did the manufacturers of these things even
consider the evil they were unleashing?

In summary, your music sucks, and your speakers suck too.
