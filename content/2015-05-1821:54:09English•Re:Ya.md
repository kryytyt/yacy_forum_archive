English â€¢ Re: Yacy grabbing all the RAM - too many JVM processes

Thank you for your suggestions.\
\
I do not use any custom script to start yacy, and it does not feel yacy
start several times (I assume some strange stuff would appear on my
ports, and the log would tell me some things about it, or the new
instances would crash maybe).\
\
Your suggestion about config first surprised me, since I can not
remember tinkering with the config. However, when I try a fresh Yacy
install, only 60 processe show up in \"pstree\" (up to 85 if I display
the web portal), for about 300 Mb. Hence I guess you \'ve got a point
there: something must be wrong with my config.\
\
So thanks again for your helpful reaction; I shall tell you more when
further investigated.
