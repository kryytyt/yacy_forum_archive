> Court was told Lawrence set off the metal detector at an exit from the
> \"secure area\" with more frequency than any other employee \-- save
> those with metal medical implants. When that happened, the procedure
> was to do a manual search with a hand-held wand, a search that he
> always passed.
>
> Investigators also found a container of vaseline in his locker and the
> trial was presented with the prospect that a puck could be concealed
> in an anal cavity and not be detected by the wand. In preparation for
> these proceedings, ***in fact, a security employee actually tested the
> idea,*** Barnes said. \[\...\]
>
> Barnes implied there were many ways Lawrence could have legitimately
> obtained the gold \-- he could have bought the coins, for instance \--
> and said he made no efforts to be devious with the gold buyers or the
> bank. Further, Barnes said, the Mint isn\'t even sure a theft took
> place.
>
> \"In fact, I would submit the Mint doesn\'t even know if anything is
> missing.\"
