Now I realize I didn\'t answer Orbiter\'s question.\
\
As far as my SNMP knowledge goes, an SNMP interface for a specific
package like Yacy means creating new OID\'s for each variable you want
to monitor.\
Example: a OID for Free Memory, a OID for Used Memory, etc.\
You can create new OID\'s by adding directives in snmpd.conf file, much
like as in here
(<http://www.zwamneus.nl/creating-a-custom-snmp-oid-for-a-bash-script/>)\
\
But as far as Cacti (and other monitoring tools like Zabix) is
concerned, a SNMP OID as data input method is one of the alternatives,
the other being a stand-alone script like the ones I showed above.\
\
So, in summary, if you want to let Yacy be monitored by tools like
Cacti, make sure you provide xml pages with as many attributes as you
may want to monitor.\
\
In my humble opinion, you don\'t need to focus in creating a SNMP
interface since you already provide the xml interfaces that can easily
act as data input methods for those tools.\
\
My suggestion would be, maybe, to add some more attributes to
Network.xml (or create a new xml for those new attributes), for example,
disk usage, or any other attribute that currently doesn\'t show in the
xmls but is already present in the /Status pages.
