The Follower Factory
====================

Date: 2018-01-28 02:11:03

A data-heavy and well researched article about the \"buy followers\"
scams. It is ***JUST SO WEIRD*** that the New York Times was able to
crunch the numbers and see obvious botnets pop out, but Twitter and
Facebook are incapable of this. ***SO WEIRD.***

> The real Jessica Rychly is a Minnesota teenager with a broad smile and
> wavy hair. She likes reading and the rapper Post Malone. When she goes
> on Facebook or Twitter, she sometimes muses about being bored or
> trades jokes with friends. Occasionally, like many teenagers, she
> posts a duck-face selfie.
>
> But on Twitter, there is a version of Jessica that none of her friends
> or family would recognize. While the two Jessicas share a name,
> photograph and whimsical bio \-- \"I have issues\" \-- the other
> Jessica promoted accounts hawking Canadian real estate investments,
> cryptocurrency and a radio station in Ghana. The fake Jessica followed
> or retweeted accounts using Arabic and Indonesian, languages the real
> Jessica does not speak. While she was a 17-year-old high school
> senior, her fake counterpart frequently promoted graphic pornography,
> retweeting accounts called Squirtamania and Porno Dan.
>
> All these accounts belong to customers of an obscure American company
> named Devumi that has collected millions of dollars in a shadowy
> global marketplace for social media fraud. Devumi sells Twitter
> followers and retweets to celebrities, businesses and anyone who wants
> to appear more popular or exert influence online. Drawing on an
> estimated stock of at least 3.5 million automated accounts, each sold
> many times over, the company has provided customers with more than 200
> million Twitter followers, a New York Times investigation found.
