Ok Sorry I did not explain very well.\
I have Exported my index.\
I tried to process it with QuickBASIC 4.5 and when I input the data from
the exported file, I get Out Of String Space error on a line input.\
For this error to happen the data in the line in the export file is
longer than 23800 characters. eg a Title or Description.\
\
Currently I have to open the exported file with a text editor an remove
the first 100 lines of the file.\
I will have to export it again and then copy what I find in a few days.\
It mainly looks like a lot of extended ASCII characters eg above code
127.\
\
Is there any way to limit the length of the data in an export?\
\
Looking at some of the exported data the average would be approx 150
characters or less, depends on the web site though.\
\
Links like this one I have to remove.\
