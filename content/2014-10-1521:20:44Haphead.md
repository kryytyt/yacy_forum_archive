> Ten years from now, videogames are so immersive that teenagers learn
> lethal skills just by playing. They\'re called hapheads.
>
> Maxine is a quiet teenage girl working at a factory that\'s
> manufacturing new haptic cable inputs. After she steals one, her
> favourite rabbit-ninja game gets a whole lot more punishing, with the
> haptic feedback loop beating skills into her muscle memory.
>
> But it\'s just a game\... until a fellow haphead causes her father\'s
> death. Then she starts to apply her new deadly abilities to finding
> out why.
>
> For more of the story, check out our original proof-of-concept trailer
> that we made earlier this year to get our production funding.
