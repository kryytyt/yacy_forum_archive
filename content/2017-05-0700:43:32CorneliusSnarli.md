[The camera caught a glimpse of a young white-tailed deer standing near
the skeleton with a human rib bone in its
mouth.](http://www.popsci.com/deer-eating-human-remains)

> Then it happened again on January 13 \-- the camera caught a deer with
> another rib sticking out of its mouth like a cigar. It\'s not clear
> whether it was the same deer in both cases, but it\'s certainly
> possible first one came back for seconds.
>
> This is the first known evidence of a deer scavenging human bones, and
> the authors published their findings in the Journal of Forensic
> Sciences.
