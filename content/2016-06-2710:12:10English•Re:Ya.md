Hi peevacorn, as it is said on the apple page you used, they offer a
deprecated java version (java 6). Current official Oracle java version
is java 8, and YaCy require at least java 7 to run.\
So you should \"download the latest version of Java for OS X directly
from Oracle <https://www.java.com> \" as stated on Apple page.\
Don\'t hesitate to ask again if you encounter other issues.
