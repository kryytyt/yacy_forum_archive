Hello,\
as you may have noticed, even the W3C is [now
supporting](https://www.w3.org/blog/2016/08/memento-at-the-w3c/){.postlink}
web resources versionning on its own web site through the
[Memento](http://mementoweb.org/about/){.postlink} Protocol.\
\
Interesting points with the Memento project is that it appears to be
already supported by many large web archives, and it also support
self-archiving with
[SiteStory](http://mementoweb.github.io/SiteStory/){.postlink}.\
\
So one can imagine some YaCy support at various levels (crawling, index
sharing, search results links\...). I am not sure providing alternative
versions links in search results is the most relevant to start with,
considering it is supposed to be handled soon natively by browsers
themselves\...
