The requested option does not exist directly, but it is e.g. possible to
remove all entries from the index which are older than a specified time.
I guess that makes quite sense to drop search results older than one
year, for example. This can be acchieved within two steps:\
\
1.) Go to \"http://localhost:8090/IndexDeletion\_p.html\" and delete
entries older than a specified age.\
2.) At \"http://localhost:8090/Table\_API\_p.html\" you find this
deletion as a recorded action and you\'ve got the possibility to set it
as a repeated action, e.g. after every start.
