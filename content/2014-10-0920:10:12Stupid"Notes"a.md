Stupid \"Notes\" app.
=====================

Date: 2014-10-09 20:10:12

It seems like every time I edit a \"note\" on my iPad, then later edit
it on my iPhone, the page duplicates, with both edits, and I have to
merge them by hand. (What year is this?)

I can\'t duplicate this bug when I try, but I\'ve been seeing it for
*years*. Do you understand the conditions that trigger it? Is there a
workaround? Notes are sync\'ed to an IMAP account on my server, not
iCloud.

I know there are a ton of way-more-complex note-sharing apps out there
with way more features, but I really only need something dead simple \--
I need nothing more than what Notes does, minus this irritating bug \--
so evangelizing all the hairy features of other apps will be
uncompelling.
