== Set up Raspberry Pi with YaCy ==\
\
The \[http://www.raspberrypi.org/ Raspberry Pi\] (\'RPi\') is a
credit-card-sized single-board computer which can run Linux kernel-based
operating systems. We consider the usage of a \'Model B\' with 512 MB
SDRAM. Since this computer consumes only 3.5 W it is an ideal plattform
for private \'cloud\' applications and also to run a YaCy peer 24x7.\
\
There is a wide range of \[http://elinux.org/RPi\_Distributions
available operating systems for the RPi\]. There is also a \'default\'
system recommended by the makers of the RPi, called \"Raspbian\" which
is based on debian wheezy.\
\
=== Running YaCy on Raspbian ===\
\
\* Download the soft-float ABI version of Raspian called
\"wheezy-armel\" from http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads\
\* Write the image to a SD card, a manual for Windows, Mac and Linux is
at http://elinux.org/RPi\_Easy\_SD\_Card\_Setup\
\* When the RPi starts up the first time, enable the ssh server in the
Raspi-config menu and run expand-rootfs to use the full sd card
capacity.\
\* log in to your RPi using ssh with the user \'pi\' and the password
\'raspberry\'.\
\* install YaCy by following the \[\[En:DebianInstall \| YaCy for debian
how-to\]\] - this will also automatically install Java. We recommend to
lower the RAM to about 180 MB (this is still experimental)\
\
After YaCy has started, it takes some time until the web interface is
available.
