So basically [FASHIONCLEFT](http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35672.pdf)
is [IP Over Avian Carriers](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149), NSA
Edition.

It\'s a protocol for encapsulating hashed, possibly encrypted, packets
from other protocols inside a completely different protocol: you allow
outbound ssh (let\'s say) so it dumps your internal network traffic onto
the end of legitimate ssh packets that were on their way out anyway!
I\'m not entirely clear on whether this encapsulation is happening at
the transport layer (munging TCP packets) or the session layer (munging
in protocol-specific ways, like MPEG frames or something).

Those packets can be going *anywhere* and NSA will still be able to see
them all because they own the midpoint routers, passively inspecting
packets during transit. They\'re using existing connections as
dead-drops, but the payload is copied before it even makes it to the
drop.

And it\'s probably your BIOS that\'s doing this. Good times.
