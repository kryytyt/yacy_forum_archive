English â€¢ How to search all of craigslist?
==========================================

I want to search search multiple craigslist.org sites at once and almost
real time. The problem is, they won\'t allow that. They let you search
one sub-page per query. Many sites use google to offer customized
craigslist searches. However, google doesn\'t offer up to date results.
So those pages have poorly results. There are many scripts out there but
most of them are out of date. Plus the craigslist.org administrators ban
everybody who intent to index their site.\
I wish to make a personal search engine similar to the:\

Unfortunately the service was forced to shut down:\

\
I know, I could make an RSS feed reader, but that\'s very inflexible. So
the question is, is YaCy suitable for the job or shall I write a script
instead? Than is possible to avoid getting banned?
