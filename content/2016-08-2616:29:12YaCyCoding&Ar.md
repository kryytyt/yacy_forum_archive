YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: YaCy Release 1.90

Hello, indeed YaCy is writing its DATA folder inside its own
YaCy.app/Contents/MacOS folder, so this can not work from a write
protected parent container.\
I still have a YaCY 1.82 MacOS release and it is working this way\... I
didn\'t check the standard MacOS policy regarding where to write app
data. Do you think writing data directly to an app package is bad
practice?\
If so I think we can choose explicitly the DATA folder when launching
startYACY.sh with \"-startup
\[folder\_path\_relative\_to\_user\_home\]\" options\...
