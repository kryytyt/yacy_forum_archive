> This isn\'t 2009. Your phone doesn\'t have a floppy drive, and it
> shouldn\'t have a headphone connector either. When we made iPhone 6
> and 6s, the world wasn\'t ready for the future. Now, it is. Apple Plug
> is the perfect solution. Fill in your archaic headphone connector with
> beautiful aluminium and plug yourself into the future.
>
> Perfect Fit
>
> Innovation isn\'t always obvious to the eye, but look a little closer
> at Apple Plug. You\'ll find it is designed to fit seamlessly into the
> outdated headphone connector, transforming last year\'s phone into a
> modern masterpiece as beautifully as you\'d expect from Apple. Once in
> place, Apple Plug cannot be removed. But why would you want to? Would
> you want to downgrade? We didn\'t think so.
>
> Pure Invention
>
> Innovation questions everything you know. We removed the floppy drive,
> and people said we were wrong. We weren\'t. We removed the CD drive,
> and again people said we were wrong. We weren\'t. We never are. Apple
> Plug isn\'t just a pristine product. It\'s an essential part of
> showing others who you are.
>
> Aluminium. Crafted with precision.
>
> Just trust us. It\'s better.
