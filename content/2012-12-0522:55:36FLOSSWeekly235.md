BroadleafCommerce is an open-source, eCommerce framework written
entirely in Java.

It is targeted at facilitating the development of enterprise-class,
commerce-driven sites by providing a robust data and service model, a
rich administration platform, and specialized tooling that takes care of
core commerce functionality.

To accomplish this goal, we have developed the platform based on the key
feature sets required by world-class online retailers and we\'re
committed to continually expanding our feature offering. We\'ve also
taken extra steps to guarantee interoperability with today\'s enterprise
by utilizing standards wherever possible and incorporating
best-of-breed, open-source software libraries from the community.

Hosts: [Randal Schwartz](http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/) and [Dan
Lynch](http://danlynch.org/).

Guest: [Jeff
Fischer](http://docs.broadleafcommerce.org/current/Home.html).
