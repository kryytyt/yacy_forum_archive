> There\'s been a lot of press about Uber\'s latest problem \-- the
> California Department of Motor Vehicles has announced that
> ride-sharing drivers, who are in fact using their vehicles for a
> commercial purpose, need to get commercial plates.
>
> That\'s not the end of the world \-- but it\'s a big blow to the Uber
> model, which calls for people to buy cars, with Uber-backed financing,
> and turn them into taxis without following the rules that apply to
> taxis. Getting commercial plates takes a little longer (if there are
> 11,000 Uber drivers in San Francisco, and all of them have to get
> appointments at the DMV, the backup could take a while.)
>
> But Uber is saying it doesn\'t care: The company protests the ruling,
> and will keep right on encouraging people to register their cars as
> personal, noncommercial vehicles \-- the same way the company has
> offered to pay the fines in some cities for Uber drivers who illegally
> pick up and discharge passengers at airports.
>
> The same way Airbnb encouraged people to violate city zoning and tax
> laws and rent out their homes as hotel rooms.
>
> Here\'s the motto: It\'s better to ask forgiveness than permission \--
> particularly if you have a billion dollars or more in the bank and
> some very powerful people on your side.
