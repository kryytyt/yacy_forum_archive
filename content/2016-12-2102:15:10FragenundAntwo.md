Fragen und Antworten â€¢ Crawl/Index all files found
==================================================

Date: 2016-12-21 02:15:10

Hello,\
\
I\'d like to setup a crawl to collect all images, videos, pdfs, Word
documents, etc found on some intranet sites. I don\'t see any options in
any config file to allow for this to be completed. Storage space is not
an issue. Even if yacy cannot parse the file (such as video files), I\'d
like the name and location on the site indexed. Currently, I\'m parsing
the log files to find files the indexer refused to create a list on a
wiki, which is then indexed by the crawler.\
\
Thank you.
