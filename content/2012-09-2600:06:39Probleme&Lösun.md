Probleme & Lösungen • Configuring to only process single (or limited) domains
=============================================================================

Hi :)\
\
We have an internal top-level domain with many thousands of servers.\
Let\'s call it g3n. , that\'s g3n dot, the dot meaning the DNS root, to
be clear\
this is a top-level domain.\
\
The servers might be:\
a.g3n, b.g3n, c.g3n, w2x9y5z.g3n, etcetera.\
\
Due to design and partitioning, the full list of servers is considered
to be\
both unknown and unlimited.\
\
These servers may have links in their HTML, plain text documents, files\
served via web/ftp, etc\... to the usual public internet sites, google,
yahoo, etc.\
\
How do I configure Yacy to crawl and index ONLY the entire g3n domain?\
\
How do I configure Yacy to crawl and index and share subsets of the g3n\
domain amongst Yacy peers? ie:\
\
yacy1 gets to do 0.g3n through g.g3n, ignoring h.g3n through zzzz.g3n as
it encounters them.\
yacy2 gets to do h.g3n through zzzz.g3n, ignoring 0.g3n through g.g3n as
it encounters them.\
\
The servers do follow a regular expression, let\'s say:
\'\^\[0-9a-z\]{10}.tld\$\'\
\
We also have another domain, call it k5a.\
\
How do I configure a limited list of only those domains (g3n, k5a, etc)
we\'re interested in?\
And how about the work dividing subset configuration within that?\
\
The second level domain (2ld.tld) is usually the server. But in some
cases, the third\
or further levels are the servers (server.3ld.2ld.tld). How does that
affect things?\
\
Thank you.\
\
(I will try to use google translate on replies.)
