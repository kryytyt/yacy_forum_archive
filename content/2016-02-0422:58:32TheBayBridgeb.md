The Bay Bridge bike path designs are completely insane.

To call me an advocate for bicycling infrastructure would be putting it
mildly\... but the money it would require to put a bike lane on the Bay
Bridge is an idiotic use of public funds that completely dwarfs the
Super Bowl and the America\'s Cup combined by several orders of
magnitude. I can\'t believe they\'re still spending money \-- and *so
much money* \-- still even *thinking* about this.

They\'ve already set fire to [*ten million
dollars*](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/11/10m-study-for-1b-bike-path/)
just on this *study!* That\'s *more than half* of SFMTA\'s 2015 budget
for bike infrastructure (\$17.8M) for this powerpoint of science fiction
nonsense. That\'s real bike lanes you are not riding on right now.

How about something more practical, like a [six mile bicycle
zip-line](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2010/03/i-want-a-zip-line/), or the
[Alameda-Weehawken burrito
tunnel](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2007/04/the-alameda-weehawken-burrito-tunnel/).
