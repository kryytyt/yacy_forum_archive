added a framework for loklak apps using schema.org and json-ld.
To get a list of apps, just call http://localhost:9000/api/apps.json
This list is made from single json files which must be attached to each
loklak app. The required files had been added as well with this commit
for the already existing apps.
Please read apps.md for more details.
