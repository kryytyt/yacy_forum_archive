[The system gives the agency access to billions of license plate records
and new powers of real-time location

> Vigilant Solutions has amassed a database of more than 2 billion
> license plate photos by ingesting data from partners like vehicle
> repossession agencies and other private groups. Vigilant also partners
> with local law enforcement agencies, often collecting even more data
> from camera-equipped police cars. The result is a massive
> vehicle-tracking network generating as many as 100 million sightings
> per month, each tagged with a date, time, and GPS coordinates of the
> sighting.
>
> ICE agents would be able to query that database in two ways. A
> historical search would turn up every place a given license plate has
> been spotted in the last five years, a detailed record of the
> target\'s movements. That data could be used to find a given
> subject\'s residence or even identify associates if a given car is
> regularly spotted in a specific parking lot. \[\...\]
>
> ICE agents can also receive instantaneous email alerts whenever a new
> record of a particular plate is found \[\...\] With sightings flooding
> in from police dashcams and stationary readers on bridges and toll
> booths, it would be hard for anyone on the list to stay unnoticed for
> long. \[\...\]
>
> The biggest concern for critics is the sheer scale of Vigilant\'s
> network, assembled almost entirely outside of public accountability.
> \"If ICE were to propose a system that would do what Vigilant does,
> there would be a huge privacy uproar and I don\'t think Congress would
> approve it,\" Stanley says. \"But because it\'s a private contract,
> they can sidestep that process.\"

> There is no evidence to support claims made by ICE officials that
> sanctuary policies compromise public safety, and a host of studies,
> including one from the Journal of Law and Economics, that found no
> correlation between public safety and increased deportation. There is
> little dispute that immigrants commit fewer crimes than citizens. And,
> the Center of American Progress found that sanctuary jurisdictions are
> actually safer than those without sanctuary policies.

> ICE regularly engages in enforcement action without any judicial
> oversight. Under the Bush Administration, ICE agents routinely raided
> homes without warrants, where they arrested people on sight, often
> breaking up families in the middle of the night. ICE often acts in
> secret, and provides very little information to the public about their
> operations.
