Arrh sorry! I forgot to mention that the authentication method switched
in the meantime from Basic HTTP to Digest HTTP, thus encoding
differently the admin password.\
So, after upgrading from 1.92/9000, you currently (this may be improved
for the next official release, as well as the error message you got\...)
have to explicitely run

Code: 
:   `dpkg-reconfigure yacy`

and enter again your admin password. Then it should be ok!
