Extended Apache HTTP Digest Auth. for use of YaCy encoded password

When programmatically requesting the local peer with Apache http client,
authentication credentials must be passed as clear-text values. 
This extension to the apache org.apache.http.impl.auth.DigestScheme
permits use of the YaCy encoded password stored in the
adminAccountBase64MD5 configuration property.
