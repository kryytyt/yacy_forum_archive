Bot

![](http://www.jwz.org/images/replicator.jpg)Look, I want to make a bar
bot that is a spider that climbs up your leg, uses its forelegs to pry
open your mouth, then gently inserts its silicone ovipositor to inject
you with your chosen shot of liquor.

And as it is squirting pressurized tequila down your esophagus, it will
say, *\"I am the GoogleBot! I am here to index you! I am the GoogleBot!
I am here to index you!\"*

Is that so wrong? Who do I know who can help me develop the necessary
skill set?
