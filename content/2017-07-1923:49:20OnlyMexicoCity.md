> So before nuclear war ends all life on Earth, for shits \'n giggles,
> why not have this artwork displayed on billboards right where much of

> be alerted, and they won\'t even need the glasses!
>
> It turned out to be a little more difficult than I imagined.. The
> first billboard company, \'Clear Channel\', was good to go. I had it
> all planned out with them before I started the crowd funding. They had
> seen the \"Make America Great Again/They Live\' art and didn\'t voice
> any objections. When I was ready to give them the money to actually
> install the Washington billboard they got cold feet and changed their
> minds.
>
> \'Outfront Media\' was the next company that respond to my inquiries.
> Again, I showed them the art first. They explained the no way in hell
> was this going to fly in Washington, so I went with a Chicago
> billboard that was around 25 by 30\' for \$2800. I redesigned the art
> to fit but just as I finished they also emailed with second thoughts
> and backed out.
>
> I went to \'Interstate Outdoor Advertising\' and sent them the art.
> Again, no problem. What I could get for our \$3000 was a 14 by 48\'
> billboard outside of Chicago on I-55. I again redrew the art to fit,
> signed the contracts and sent them my payment information. Then they
> came to their senses and said no-go.
>
> I went back to \'JCDecaux\' a company I had sounded out earlier that
> only offered those 5\' high panels on the side of bus stops in
> Chicago. At this point, I\'m open to most anything. For \$3000 I could
> have one on Michigan Ave for a month, but a day later this was waiting
> in my inbox \"I\'m afraid that since this is political in nature,
> especially with the bad press Kathy Griffin gave recently, the City
> will turn down your ad copy\" was their thanks but no thanks response.
>
> In all I think I contacted over thirty billboard companies, some that
> had thousands of ones for rent, and many that had only a few regional
> offerings. Most didn\'t even respond to multiple inquiries. The ones
> that did, started to realize that this is a President that, in all
> likelihood, will make it a personal vendetta to destroy whatever
> company dares mock him. Others were more upfront with their reasoning,
> \"Thanks for your e-mail. I will discuss your artwork and idea with
> the owner of our company on Monday. However, I need to let you know
> that we are all huge Trump supporters and we would not post anything
> on our billboards that would appear to disparage the President in any
> way. Love Donald Trump!!!!\"
>
> Yes, I don\'t think much of Donald Trump, but I soft-selled this as
> much as humanly possible when making the pitch to anyone I could find,
> but it was a no-go TO EVERY SINGLE BILLBOARD COMPANY IN THE UNITED
> STATES! I thought that was the end of it. But then, cue music, the
> brave folks across the border, the upstanding heroic citizens of
> Mexico that Trump based his campaign on objectifying as rapists and
> criminals, had the cojones to give Trump the FU.
>
> God Bless Mexico, the only country left that has the freedom to
> display the The Trump / They Live Billboard!
