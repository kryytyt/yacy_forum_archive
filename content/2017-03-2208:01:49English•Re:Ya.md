Hi Mario, and sorry for this late answer.\
\
Even if possible, I would not recommend modifying directly the
/usr/share/yacy/htroot/index.html file as it is part of the distributed
YaCy debian package : it would be later overridden when upgrading your
YaCy version, and it is generally not a good idea to modify files that
are part of a package because doing so you break the interest of using a
package manager.\
\
So I would rather suggest you to copy the
/usr/share/yacy/htroot/index.html file to /usr/share/yacy/DATA/HTDOCS
and then modify it. I just checked to be sure and it works as expected.\
\
Best regards
