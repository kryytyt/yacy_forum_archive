![](https://www.jwz.org/images/head-asplode.png)When a multi-billionaire
puts out a press release saying that *eventually* they will transfer
all-but-a-billion-or-so into a \"charitable foundation\" that they *also
completely control*, that is not a *donation*, that is just moving your
money from one bank account to another! And it\'s not even that, it\'s
claiming that he\'s fixin\' to get ready to do that some day.

I\'ve even seen people saying, \"I feel better about using Facebook
now!\" Fuck you.

This is just how billionaires launder money. It buys you good press and
also gives you great opportunities to hand out million-a-year management
salaries and board positions to your lesser cronies.

Save your applause for when he\'s actually built a desalinization plant
or something, rather than being one of the primary drivers of the
Public-Private Surveillance Partnership.
