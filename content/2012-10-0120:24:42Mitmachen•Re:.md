Yeah I hated doing servlets at uni. With it already being in CSS can\'t
we just create a new CSS stylesheet and upload that? There\'s no reason
to create new HTML / server-side code for a new look and feel. But that
could be what you mean already.\

Yacy desperately needs a new UI if it\'s to attract the attention of the
masses. At the moment it has a very dated look to it.
