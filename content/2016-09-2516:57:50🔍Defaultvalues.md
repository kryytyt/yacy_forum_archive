🔍 Default values for description and link in rss (#845)

* 🔍 Default values for description and link in rss

🔍 This resolves the issue https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server/issues/828 by providing default vaues to description and link which is used in case, the fields are empty. This uses the title as the default description and http://loklak.org/ as the default link.  👍

* Link will not be empty :sake:
