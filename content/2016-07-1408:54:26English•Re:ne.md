Thank you for your patient and detailed reply and testing.\
\
Your comment on potential problems reading the Solr files, flags a
recurring problem / issue\
I/we have seen this problem, before, in the 1.83/9857 +related
generations.\
This is seen, notably, when we need to move DATA sets to a fresh,
certified, public build \#.\
This happens most frequently when the move becomes urgently needed.\
This happens when /ConfigHeuristics\_p.html is suddenly unavailable, and
shows Solr error mssages, due to a breakdown in the surrounding
machine.\
Typically it is in the Heuristics page that we see this failure, and
when it fails, it produces what seems to be a non-recoverable error.\
\
Following instructions from Orbiter, some years ago, for this specific
type of case, we have relied on moving DATA sets to fresh, healthy
installs.\
This has not always been successful, to say the least.\
We have lost access to DATA sets.\
Our DATA sets are frequently on the order of 20+ GB or more.\
\
Despite carefully recovering and patiently moving them, we frequently we
have huge trouble getting the moved DATA pack to be read, at all.\
This is shown in the new \'fresh build\' vm refusing to start.\
Removing the DATA set and letting the new vm build a new empty DATA set,
shows the vm is comparatively healthy.\
Stopping it, properly, removing the \'fresh\' empty DATA set and
replacing it with our DATA set, and restarting - even in
\'administrator\' mode in the Win version, generates a \'no start\'
reaction.\
I have struggled with this in both Ubuntu installs for 3+ years and more
recently in Windows installs.\
\
I am wondering about the UTF- 8 issue.\
I may be totally wrong, of course.\
Our focused crawls are done in up to 40 languages. Our DATA sets are, of
necessity, heavily loaded with many languages and types of characters.\
By looking at front end search result \'symptoms,\' this may give us a
clue to the / or an / underlying problem.\
Users need to search from the front end in any of the source languages,
of course.\
\
I have noticed, also, that sometimes when a front end search is done
specifically in Ukrainian or Russian (for example) the results are very
limited, even though there has been a lot of suitable original data
mined and cross indexed, previously.\
Results in Ukrainian are smaller than Russian results and sometimes only
a few pages of results display.\
The front end search, using a built in generic display panel, tends to
go back to Page 1 - even when a Page 3 or Page 4 is selected to be
displayed next.\
This happens also when we know that there is substantial \'extra\' data
results that can be displayed.\
The numbers of potential results shown at the top of the results page
also seems smaller than should be available.\
Reverting to Page 1 happens in cases where we know there is more data
and larger available results are shown to be available.\
\
Can this create a weakness in the later readability of DATA sets that
have been moved to a fresh vm?\
If \'yes,\' how can this be \'strengthened\' to make the DATA sets more
reliably readable, when moved?\
\
I appreciate your thoughts on this, please.\
As noted above, I may be totally off base in this examination, but some
of the impacts could - perhaps - be as we are seeing them.\
\
Thank you very kindly, once again, for your patient help!\
Your seasoned expertise is most appreciated
