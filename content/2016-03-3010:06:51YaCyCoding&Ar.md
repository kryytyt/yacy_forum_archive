Hey luc,\
I just tried this and it is working fine! Thats a good thing!\
We should integrate this into the main branch. I had a look into your
commits: that was a lot of work and you changed quite a bit. I must take
some time to read all the changes. I believe you fixed a lot of path
issues to make this possible?
