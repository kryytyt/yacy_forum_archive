reger is working on the auth mechanism and he wants to migrate from
BASIC auth to DIGEST auth. This is a work in progress and I am confident
that this is a matter of some days to work again.\

jre6-headless should be sufficient, i don\'t know if there is a
jre7-headless. I would also suggest to try jre6 in favor of jre7 and
check resource amount. I remember that jre7 had some issues in the
beginning and that i.e. solr was not working on jre7. Maybe oracle had
messed it up when their developers first tried to enhance jre\...\

I was very happy to see that you had (a kickstarter) experience with
other projects on the RPi and that had a connection on the selection of
a different OS than raspian. I though this experience could be a missing
element for the YaCy-on-RPi challenge.\

We have seen this out-of-nothing crashes of YaCy without leaving a
message in the log a lot. Until today I don\'t know how to find out what
it is. I belive it could be different in different jre versions because
it is an in-jre bug. What did you find out?
