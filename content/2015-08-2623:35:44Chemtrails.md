I mean, I love apocalyptic illuminati conspiracy fiction as much as the
next guy \-- ok, a lot more than the next guy, because that guy\'s a
sheeple \-- but come on.

Slow news week? Ran out of Dirt Rave stories already?

We should *be so lucky* as to have a vast, faceless meta-governmental
conspiracy that was competent enough to pull this off. It would mean
that *adults* were in charge. Or Gods.

> A thumbnail sketch of the science behind chemtrails is difficult
> because there are competing theories about what that science entails.
> But most activists, including Roddie, agree that curbing global
> warming seems to be the purpose. In layman\'s terms, chemtrails are
> believed to be an aerosol that contains aluminum (which deflects
> sunlight), as well as a cocktail of other toxic elements such as
> barium and strontium. According to Roddie, this aerosol has insidious
> side effects, including Alzheimer\'s, autism, asthma, respiratory
> failure, pulmonary failure, and stroke.
>
> Another major side effect: California\'s historic drought. \[\...\]

> Hall says she protects herself as best she can, but as a gardener, she
> works outside every day and is vulnerable. She no longer drives with
> her windows down, she says, and she bought a water filter to sift out
> impurities. Occasionally, she detoxes from the heavy metals in her
> blood by taking supplements such as chlorella, zeolite powder, and
> bentonite clay. She also eats as much cilantro as she can, which
> assuages metallic contamination, she claims.
>
> Rumors of sickness and bodily mutation run rampant through the
> chemtrails community. Hall mentions a fellow activist who tested her
> dog\'s blood for heavy metals and discovered thorium, a radioactive
> element that has been used as nuclear fuel.
>
> She also mentions Morgellons, a controversial condition \-- classified
> by most physicians as a delusional parasitosis \-- in which people
> develop sores they believe to be caused by parasites, insects, or
> invasive synthetic fibers. In 2008, the Centers for Disease Control
> and Prevention investigated Morgellons among patients in Northern
> California, a hotbed of self-reported Morgellons diagnoses, and
> concluded there was \"no infectious cause and no evidence of an
> environmental link.\"
>
> Hall is unconvinced. \"All of us have fibers in us because they spray
> them in the sky, and they\'re all over the ground, and they\'re in the
> soil, and they\'re in the water,\" she says. **\"These fibers are
> self-replicating nanotechnology. To me, those are the scariest words
> I\'ve ever heard in my life.\"**
>
> Marsha Dawson, a North Bay activist who works with Roddie and Hall,
> agrees that chemtrails exact a disastrous human toll. She says she
> experiences \"memory problems\" and lung pain because of her exposure.
> Dawson drinks Fiji and Volvic water constantly because both contain
> silica that, she claims, loosens the aluminum particles in her body.
> She also finds relief in black cherry bark syrup from Whole Foods.

> The scope of the program Herndon envisions is mind-boggling. According
> to him, the fly ash is transported on railways that connect coal
> plants to military and civilian airports across the country. The ash
> is loaded onto a fleet of 1,000 or more planes, he estimates, all of
> which fly off-the-radar, often at night, without transponders or
> flight plans. These ghost planes, Herndon says, have poisoned the
> country and induced California\'s drought. He alleges that certain
> leafy plants in the Golden State now exhibit high concentrations of
> thallium \-- Saddam Hussein\'s favorite poison for political
> assassinations. \[\...\]

> \"Pretty much one hundred percent of people who believe in chemtrails

> a \"nonpartisan, independent media organization\" that promotes the
> idea of a 9/11 cover-up.) \[\...\]

> As West points out, the scope of the program that Herndon suggests

At least chemtrails are vegan. Better drink Pepsi-branded bottled water,
though, just to be safe. STAY VIGILANT.
