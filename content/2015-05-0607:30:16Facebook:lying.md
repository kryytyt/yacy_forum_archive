Well guess what, it took seven months, but said drag queens have finally
noticed that Facebook\'s [bullshit was
bullshit](http://sfist.com/2015/05/05/drag_queens_renew_fight_over_facebo.php).
Now they have a
[petition](https://www.change.org/p/noprideforfacebook-ban-facebook-from-sf-ny-pride-parade)
to ban Facebook from the SF and NY Pride parades. Which you should
probably sign, because why the hell not. Anything that causes discomfort
to their PR flacks can\'t be bad.
