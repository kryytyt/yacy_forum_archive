Lazyweb, do X11 PseudoColor displays still exist in the real world? Does
that even *work* on modern Linux GUI desktops?

My guess is that even the bittiest bittybox 5v microcontroller from the
last decade that is capable of running Unix has an HDMI output and a
24-bit-deep TrueColor frame buffer.

And therefore I no longer have to worry about breaking compatibility
with, like, pre-ANSI SunOS 4 systems in current XScreenSaver releases.

Dissenting opinions?
