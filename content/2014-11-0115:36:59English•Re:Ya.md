English • Re: Yacy on an Olinuxino board
========================================

Date: 2014-11-01 15:36:59

I might ask Olimex about this issue, juts like I can fill a bug report.\
\
About the hardware, the board I am using (A20-Lime2, as said in the
first post) cost me something like 65€ including VAT, shipping and SATA
cables. In addition to the 1Gb of RAM, I set up 2Gb of SWAP, just in
case.\
\
But before doing anything, I will try another thing. I have noticed this
morning that my laptop kernel is 3.14, while the one shipped on Raspbian
nowadays is 3.12. Yacy seems to run on both. My Olinuxino board has only
a 3.4 kernel; so I will try to upgrade it or compile a kernel (3.12
minimum) to see if it can solve the issue.\
\
In any case, I will let you know about this try, and will fill a bug
report and/or contact Olimex, depending on my findings.\
\
Thanks for your links, especially the one to fill a report.\
\
EDIT: it seems there are no images available for my boards with kernel
3.12 or higher. Since I will not have much time to work on it in the
next days, I have sent an email to Olimex. I shall keep you informed.
