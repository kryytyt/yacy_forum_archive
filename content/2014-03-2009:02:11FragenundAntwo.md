since last release the postprocessing does not start when memory
assignment is unchanged. The postprocessing task is a high-cpu, high-RAM
task and should not be performed in the default configuration any more.
It is not a big problem if the process is not done.\
\
I will change the display of the postprocessing information to inform
about that a bit more. If you want to start the postprocessing, you must
increase RAM strongly.\
\
If your files are not postprocessed, everything is fine. The process
just creates a bit more information which can be used for a better
ranking but your search should work without the postprocessing fine.
