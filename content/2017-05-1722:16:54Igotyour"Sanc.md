> Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church is a powerful
> reactionary figure in the country\'s toxic political scene, which has
> welded a tale of thwarted imperial destiny to a thin-skinned
> fundamentalist theology that can\'t bear the slightest sign of
> mockery; he\'s blamed ISIS on secularism and Pride parades and says
> that marriage equality literally heralds the imminent apocalypse.
>
> So there\'s a lot of context behind this photo of Kirill spraying holy
> water on sensitive Russian government computer systems to fight the
> Wcry ransomware worm \[\...\] the real nexus of this photo is the
> government official with the \"you\'ve got to be kidding me\"
> expression, who exists in a power-structure that requires solemn
> professions of belief in this powerful weirdo\'s dumb rituals.

Patriarch
Daniel:](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-27885626)

> The leader of Romania\'s Orthodox church has been mocked for using a
> paint-roller dipped in holy oil to bless new TV and radio studios,
> it\'s been reported.
>
> A church spokesman later told Adevarul that it\'s not the first time
> Patriarch Daniel had used the \"sanctification rod\", one of a number
> of tools of his trade, as it helps anoint rooms with higher walls and
> ceilings which would otherwise be difficult to reach.
