The Really Big One

This is some really nicely written disaster porn.

> take place beneath the ocean, displacing a colossal quantity of

> collapse. One side will rush west, toward Japan. The other side will
> rush east, in a seven-hundred-mile liquid wall that will reach the

Hey, remember [that
time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service_bulletin_for_New_Orleans_region#Bulletin_text)
the National Weather Service put out a bulletin about \"HUMAN SUFFERING
INCREDIBLE BY MODERN STANDARDS\"? Yeah, good times.
