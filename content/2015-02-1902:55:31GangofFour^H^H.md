is *so much* snark in this article:

*Gang of Four Have Been Taking the Piss Out of Pop Culture Since 1979:*

> \"His main point is that he doesn\'t think musicians should get
> paid,\" says Andy Gill, laying into his ex-bandmate turned digital
> music guru Dave Allen, now an artist relations specialist at iTunes.
> \"He thinks music should be free. And when you actually push him on
> that, he comes up with things like, *\'Earn some money on
> ringtones.\'* Literally.\" Sniggers ripple across Andy\'s new band
> members. \"So what better person to work for Apple, having come from
> Gang of Four,\" he concludes of his ex-comrade, \"although so
> briefly.\"
>
> To be fair to Dave Allen, that last \"briefly\" dig at him lands
> slightly off the mark. The bassist, who quit suddenly during a 1981 US
> tour, played on both *Entertainment!* and *Solid Gold,* the two Gang
> of Four records the world at large cares about.

*Ooh, burn!*

> The press response was predictably confused: \'XTC meets G4NG\' should
> mean herky-jerky agitprop or a bleak industrial take on the Beatles,
> surely? Not this understated, deeply arty, bottom-heavy and lyrically
> inscrutable piece of weirdness, edging -with *\'here comes my
> handclap\'* -into avant-garde difficulty.
>
> An hilarious flame-war took place in the NME between Dave and Andy
> Gill (shades of me and Andy Partridge). Dave had accused the G4NG -in
> one of the recent articles, and in response to the inevitable *\'why
> did you leave?\'* question, of lacking ideological commitment.
>
> When *\'Tench\'* came out, of course, Gill retaliated: *\'Dave dares
> to raise the banner of ideology then releases an album about a fish\'*
> he fumed. The Two Headed, Revisionist Running-Tench that he clearly
> was.
