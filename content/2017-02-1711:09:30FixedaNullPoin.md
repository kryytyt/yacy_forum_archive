Fixed a NullPointerException case possible on Index Export

As reported by Palulukas in YaCy forum
(http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=5944&sid=dcef5b899ab4aa9b40e3a3d158c13aed#p33454)
the Index Export operation can fails, notably when the Solr index
contains one or more documents with empty (despite required)
"load_date_dt" field.

This fixes the export failure when the situation finally occurs, but
more should be done to harden verifications on minimum required fields.
