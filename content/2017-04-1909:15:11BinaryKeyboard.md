got my Emacs setup just how I like
it:](https://github.com/Chris-Johnston/BinaryKeyboard)

> Each bit is typed out from the least significant bit to the most
> significant bit (left to right). After all 8 bits have been entered,
> it will type out the ASCII value equivalent of that binary valiue.

Back in my day, we programmed with a paper clip, a nine volt battery and
a steady hand, so this is all only reasonable.
