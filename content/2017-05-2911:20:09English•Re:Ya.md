Hi,\
\
I\'m not running Yacy on a Virtual Machine, the OS has 256 GB RAM (96 GB
are dedicated to Yacy) and a 64 GB SWAP partition.\
\
Since I installed version 1.92/9218 I noticed some improvements: I can
now restart Yacy without messing up the index or the crawl, and the
crawl seems to be somewhat faster, at least for some time after the
restart.\
\
Unfortunately there are still problems: I\'ve been forced to restart the
server a couple of times because, after about 20 hours, the crawls slow
down considerably to 5-10 pages per minute until they basically stop and
the web interface becomes unresponsive. Restarting the server every 10
hours or so seems to fix the problem. The log reported multiple Solr
exception, unfortunately the logs got wiped when I restarted the server,
I\'ll post them next time it happens.\
\
I\'m running multiple crawls simultaneously as suggested in the
documentation and I get an indexing speed of about 100 to 800 pages per
minute (at least after a yacy restart, then it slows down), is that a
reasonable speed? Bandwidth shouldn\'t be a bottleneck since I\'m on a
fast gigabit fiber connection at the University.\
\
BTW: the server I\'m experimentig with is
