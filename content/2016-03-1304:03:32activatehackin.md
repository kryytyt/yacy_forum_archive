``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
activate hack in libbuild/pom.xml to include main project as build module
This allows to use libbuild/pom as main maven project to build all needed
libs to compile and run YaCy, including YaCy itself.

Furthermore, maven is well supported by Netbeans IDE so we can discontinue
to maintaine Netbeans IDE specific project settings (in directory nbproject,
which lack config for debug anyway, nbproject can be deleted and NB will
compile YaCy via maven).

Additionally adjusted pom's project name to match the name in the repository.
