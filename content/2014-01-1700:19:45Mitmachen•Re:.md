To get the latest thread dump before a peer dies I sometimes run the
following script:\

Code: 
:   `` #!/bin/sh                                                                                                                                                                                           # nohup ./grab.sh > /dev/null &echo $$ > grab.pidwhile [ -f grab.pid ]; do  wget -t 3 -O threaddump_`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`.txt "http://localhost:8090/Threaddump_p.html?plain=true"  sleep 15done ``

I still use Java 6 for my test environments, especially on my 8-year old
MacBook which still works fine. Thats also the computer I use to create
the Mac Release of YaCy. When I do the Mac Release on a much younger Mac
I am not able to run it on my old MacBook\...\

I have some important news about the search performance and performance
adaption on the RPi: today I commited a feature which reduces the number
of remote search tasks when the computer resources are low. This is what
I measure:\
\
- solr indexing Queue buffer size (if not empty thats a sign that the
computer has an IO issue/ is too slow writing things to disk\
- CPU load (signal is: load \> 2)\
- number of CPU cores (reduces search threads by less than 4 cores and
furthermore if only one core present)\
- short memory status (if assigned memory is almost taken)\
\
Please try this on a RPi to check if search can overload that. You can
run the threaddump-script as shown above during that to catch a deadlock
