this last night and it is
*amazing*:](http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/4535-the-speakeasy-is-everything-i-love-about-san-francisco)

> Part of what makes The Speakeasy such a special event are the number
> of intricate layers revealed \-- about the storyline, the set, and
> your experience with both \-- as you go along. You buy your ticket
> online and await instructions on where to meet up on the appointed
> night. You\'re given passwords and strict instructions on staying mum
> over the course of the evening. And you\'re rewarded for playing along
> with access to a labyrinth set where secret passageways offer some of
> the best seats in the house.
>
> The Speakeasy is less a straight narrative and more a
> choose-your-own-adventure collection of character studies of the folks
> who populate a San Francisco speakeasy in the 1920s. There are the mob
> bosses and the showgirls, the fallen heroes and the families they
> (tried to) leave behind. The dramatic tension here is romantic and
> political, it comes out through dialogue, song, and dance, and it\'s
> performed in the chair next to you one moment and behind glass the
> next.

[Go get your tickets, seriously.](http://www.thespeakeasysf.com/) It\'s
totally worth it. I\'m probably going to go again.
