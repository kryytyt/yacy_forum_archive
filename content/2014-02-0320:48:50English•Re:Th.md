Well I\'m an American who understands very little German.

But I respect the right of the developers and German speakers to use
their own language if they prefer. I just think it\'s great that we have
a English section on this forum now.

Sure changing to English probably would make it so more people can read
it more easily. But it feels a lot like going to Germany as a guest and
demanding everyone speak only English.
