English â€¢ Decentralized forums with Yacy - MetaNet
==================================================

Date: 2017-12-26 20:23:03

The idea is a decentralized forum that works with the help of Yacy or
any other search engine.\
\
Forums would essentially be categorized by a tag in a webpage\'s
metadata (like a hashtag).\
Everyone could post to any forum simply by creating a page with text and
adding the appropriate tag to the pages metadata (\#cars \#pets \#jobs
\#movies \#questions \....) The average person could use Wordpress or
any other CMS to make this easier.\
\
Instead of having to browse a centralized forum, one would use Yacy to
search for a \"hashtag\" and order the results by date. The results
should show posts and responses by everyone while eliminating spammers
since the search engine will be less likely to index posts with low
value.\
\
To respond to a \"forum post\" of this kind anyone else could simply
write a response on their own website with the same forum tag in the
metadata and also an identifier in the metadata linking the response to
the original post (perhaps the url of the original post).\
\
To \"follow\" someone we can use good old RSS or Atom feeds that seem to
be very under appreciated lately.\
\
This approach provides decentralized and censorship resistant forums
with already existing tools instead of requiring the development
specialized software such as Diaspora, Steem, GNUsocial and other
decentralized social networking projects.\
\
I believe the main difficulty will be for a large enough group to agree
on how exactly to tag posts and responses in the metadata.\
\
For this I have created the github project \"Metanet\"
<https://github.com/Cam-B/MetaNet>\
\
I would like to know what others think. Please share your ideas.
