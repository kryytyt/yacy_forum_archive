> You can no longer expect forty years of drudgery and then a

> You can\'t make it through life hating your boss instead of yourself,
> not when new forms of labour discipline demand that you be your own
> boss. Your flesh is already obsolete. But there\'s an answer: to
> survive in the coming era of automation, you have to bring it in
> faster; announce its apocalypse, learn to code, add yourself to the
> army of programmers building an appier tomorrow. \[\...\]

> Desperation is everywhere; exhibitors make lunging grabs for any
> passers-by wearing an \"INVESTOR\" lanyard, proffer stickers and
> goodies, scream for attention on their convention-standard signs.
> These do not, to put it kindly, make a lot of sense. \"Giving you all
> the tools you need to activate and manage your influencer marketing
> relationships,\" promises one. \"Leverage what is known to find,
> manage, and understand your data,\" entices another. The gleaming
> technological future looks a lot like a new golden age of hucksterism.
> It\'s networking; the sordid, stupid business of business; pressing
> palms with arrogant pricks, genuflecting to idiots, entirely unchanged
> by the fact that this time it\'s about apps and code rather than dog
> food or dishwashers.

> None of these start-ups are doing anything new or interesting. Which
> shouldn\'t be surprising: how often does anyone have a really good
> idea? What you actually get is just code, sloshing around, congealing
> into apps and firms that exist simply to exist. Uber for dogs, GrubHub
> for clothes, Patreon for sex, Slack for death, PayPal for God,
> WhatsApp for the spaceless non-void into which a blind universe

> Capitalism doesn\'t know what to do with its surpluses any more; it
> ruthlessly drains them from the immiserated low-tech manufacturing
> bases of the Global South, snatches them away from a first-world
> population tapping at computer code on the edge of redundancy, but
> then has nowhere better to put them than in some executive\'s
> gold-plated toilet. This soil breeds monsters; new, parasitic products
> scurry like the first worms over the world-order\'s dying body.
