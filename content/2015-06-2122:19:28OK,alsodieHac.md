OK, also die Hacker, die da die Angestelltendaten aus der US-Regierung
rausgetragen haben, das waren Chinesen!1!! Weil, äh, damit können alle
gut leben, wenn das die Chinesen waren. [Guckt euch mal an, was die so
an Security überwinden
mussten](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/us/attack-gave-chinese-hackers-privileged-access-to-us-systems.html):

> At the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which regulates nuclear
> facilities, information about crucial components was left on unsecured
> network drives, and the agency lost track of laptops with critical
> data.
>
> Computers at the I.R.S. allowed employees to use weak passwords like
> "password." One report detailed 7,329 "potential vulnerabilities"
> because software patches had not been installed. Auditors at the
> Department of Education, which stores information from millions of
> student loan applicants, were able to connect "rogue" computers and
> hardware to the network without being noticed. And at the Securities
> and Exchange Commission, part of the network had no firewall or
> intrusion protection for months.

Völlig klar, das *können* überhaupt nur die Chinesen gewesen sein!
