noted, those [annotations I\'ve been adding to the hateful surveillance
signs](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/09/exercise-vague-caution/)
haven\'t had a long life expectancy. Anyway, the day before I was
leaving town for a couple weeks, I got this email:

> I\'m a resident of \[YOUR ADDRESS\] and I\'ve been greatly enjoying

I replied:

I don\'t think anyone stepped up in my absence, and that\'s sad.

BUT YOU GUYS, the day I got back, I SAW THE GUY WHO\'S TEARING THEM
DOWN!

It\'s this old dude with a little rat-dog and I\'ve never, ever seen him
smile. I assume the dog is incontinent because he walks it like five
times a day, which explains why he\'s noticing them so quickly.

Maybe I should superglue them now. Or I could just tear down the fucking
signs once and for all, but that\'s probably going to leave glue-gunk on
the glass, and that would be lame.

I\'m torn.
