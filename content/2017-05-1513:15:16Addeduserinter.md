Added user interface feedback on results feeding termination status.

Added as an additional icon with title in the search progress bar, to
inform about background search feeder threads terminated or still
running. While giving a bit more information to users about the p2p
search process, this can help choosing whether or not wait a little bit
more time before going to the next page, in order to get results from
various sources sorted as best as possible (see #91 for a discussion
about sorting accuracy and network latency).

Other related modifications included :
 - regular updates to statistics in the progress bar until the
background feeders are completely terminated.
 - removed some uses of unsecure and discouraged JavaScript elements
```
