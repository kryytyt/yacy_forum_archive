English â€¢ Re: About Elasticsearch
=================================

There is actually currently a new YaCy \"flavor\" which uses
elasticsearch: the YaCy Grid.\
The grid is a set of four applications which can be deployed in a large
scale to massively index mass-data. It uses elasticsearch instead of
solr.\
The grid is made out of YaCy code and I currently think about an
opportunity to re-integrate this in legacy YaCy.\
\
To find out more about the YaCy Grid, please have a look at
