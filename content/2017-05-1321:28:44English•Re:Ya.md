Thanks for your reply Luc.\

Code: 
:   `cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max26251184cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr1248   0   26251184ulimit unlimited`

it looks like the crawl was within the limits. In any case I deleted the
\"freeworld\" directory in the index and I was able to start yacy. I
then restarted the crawl from scratch, but I\'m afraid it will happen
again in case yacy crashes or if I need to reboot the machine. I\'ll try
and terminate (or at least pause) the crawl before shutting down yacy,
but what worries me is that the whole application doesn\'t seem to be
very robust, if a system crash can compromise days of crawling.\
\
Also: does the crawl ever really end on it\'s own? I suppose it could go
on potentially forever, do I need to stop it manually after a while?\
\
I\'ll experiment some more.
