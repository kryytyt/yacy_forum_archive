Hello Orbiter (or any other developers reading this).\
\
I\'ve successfully implemented this, and will be sending a pull request
as soon as the code is cleaned up a little bit. Before I do so, I have a
quick question. I assume that this feature should be off by default,
since it results in a lot of extra data being generated and most users
don\'t care about it. What is the right way for a user to enable this
feature? Solr uses an HTTP GET parameter to enable this. Is that the
preferred method for YaCy as well? It\'s probably also possible to add a
setting in the ranking settings page, which would enable/disable this.
Personally I prefer using an HTTP GET parameter since it\'s somewhat
easier to quickly enable/disable than adding a ranking settings page
entry. Opinions?\
\
Cheers.
