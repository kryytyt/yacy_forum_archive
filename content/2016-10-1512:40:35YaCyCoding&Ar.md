Ok, at least you have some improvements\... As I did on my dev peer, I
propose to add some log information that would be activated only with
log level = FINE on BlackList, and would thus allow to detect what
remaining kind of URL is using too much CPU power.\
I will have some time to do it in the coming days.\
