Wunschliste â€¢ Planet - Solar System - Deep Space
================================================

Date: 2014-10-16 23:04:32

Since this is a wishlist, those are my wishes for the future:\
\
1. Planet:\
a) Augmented Crawling, with private & open mode. Private= protected
private index. Open = can be distributed to the network\
b) Cache of the most prominent searches + results within the yacy
network.\
c) Search frontend for the cache and to yacy peers\
(no \"real\" searchengine!)\
\
2. Solar System:\
An extension to the planet. It adds the crawler & solr and db features.
Planet + Solar System = What we know as YaCy - but in components\
\
3. Deep Space:\
A special index for the most rare results. You can launch a deep space
probe which will search for specific information on the net. Its crawler
which evaluates every visited page but indexes only those pages which
hold the search pattern. A webgraph is build and used to determine which
\"galaxies\" do not contain the search pattern. The starting vector
towards the \"dead galaxy\" is blacklisted. If more then one probe is
send, the blacklist can be used to avoid dead galaxies. Each probe is
given a certain lifespan (number of links to follow)\
\
Along with some other dings and dangs, this comes pretty near to my idea
of a p2p search machine - and yacy is the nicest foundation i have found
so far.
