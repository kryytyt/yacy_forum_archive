> It was close to 4am on the quiet morning of November 22, 1963 when the
> Steam Ferry Cornelius G. Kolff vanished without a trace. On its way
> with nearly 400 hundred people, mostly on their way to work, the
> disappearance of the Cornelius G. Kolff remains both one of New
> York\'s most horrific maritime tragedies and perhaps its most
> intriguing mystery. Eye witness accounts describe \"large tentacles\"
> which \"pulled\" the ferry beneath the surface only a short distance
> from its destination at Whitehall Terminal in Lower Manhattan. Nobody
> on board survived and only small pieces of wreckage have been
> found\...strangely with large \"suction cup-shaped\" marks on them.
> The only logical conclusion scientists and officials could point to
> was that the boat had been attacked by a massive octopus, roughly half
> the size of the ship. Adding to the tragedy, is that this disaster
> went almost completely unnoticed by the public as later that day
> another, more \"newsworthy\" tragedy would befall the nation when
> beloved President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated. The Staten
> Island Ferry Disaster Museum hopes to correct this oversight by
> preserving the memory of those lost in this tragedy and educating the
> public about the truth behind the only known giant octopus-ferry
> attack in the tri-state area.
