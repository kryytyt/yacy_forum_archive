Veruca Salt, OMG!

This one is late because [my computer is still all fucked up and I still
don\'t know why.](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/04/video-stuttering-2/)

Also, Youtube has completely fucked up the playlist editor again. Not
only did they stash the \"edit start and end times command\" under a
popup menu, but they put that popup menu basically right on top of the
\"delete this video from the playlist\" button. And half the time when
you try to edit a video, it gives you the *previous* video you edited
instead. Well played, Youtube. Well played.

That damned thing never worked very well \-- thanks for bouncing me back
to the keyframe all the time, that\'s *obviously* what I wanted \-- but
now it\'s *even worse*.
