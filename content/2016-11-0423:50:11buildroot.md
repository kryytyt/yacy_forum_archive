Lazyweb, if you can point me at working instructions for getting a
MacPorts-based Raspberry Pi cross-compilation environment up and running
on MacOS 10.12, that would be appreciated.

(Be advised before you point me at instructions for an older release of
MacOS, I have tried that, and it doesn\'t work.)

I\'m trying to get
[buildroot](https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html) going
but Apparently Apple\'s \"clang can *totally* just impersonate gcc\"
theory is false, and even after doing `"port select --set gcc mp-gcc7"`,
MacPorts seems to be using the wrong compiler. I can\'t even find a
straight answer on whether I should be installing `"arm-elf-gcc"` or
`"arm-none-eabi-gcc"`, but neither of them will build when doing
`"port install"`.

Fun fact: buildroot requires GNU sed. Because we\'re still innovating in
sed syntax here in the 21st century, FFS.
