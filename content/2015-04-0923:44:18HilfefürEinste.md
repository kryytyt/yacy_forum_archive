Hilfe für Einsteiger und Anwender • Re: yacybot indexing my own data?
=====================================================================

When I ask my Yacy instance to crawl someone\'s website, wouldn\'t it
try to do that on that host\'s port 80? That host has probably nothing
to do with Yacy, and it probably listens to the standard port 80.\
\
According to this, that Apache log entry would be the result of someone
else\'s Yacy instance crawling \"my website\".\
\
But\... what website?\
\
Although I recently created a website - it has only a week - it is still
not public, in the sense that not even Google, who knows everything, has
already indexed it, neither do I advertised it in whatever means, just I
and two persons know about it for testing purposes. Besides, it is not
even listening to port 80.\
\
So, this yacybot log entry is still puzzling me: who was trying to crawl
my host and why?
