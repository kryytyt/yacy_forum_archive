> The onetime Thai shopping emporium was shut down in 1997 due to
> building code violations and a massive fire that destroyed its roof.
> Apparently rainwater slowly filled the abandoned building and caused a
> major mosquito outbreak in the area. It was a bad enough problem that
> in an effort to stop the mosquitos, locals introduced freshwater fish
> to the abandoned mall to eat the insects.
