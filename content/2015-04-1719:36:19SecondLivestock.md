Range™](http://www.secondlivestock.com/)

> Eliminating the need for the physical space required for free-range
> livestock our Virtual Free Range™ gives livestock the experience of
> Free Range life while in the safe confines of our facility.
>
> Free Range life, though providing a diverse diet, exercise, and
> socialization, is inherently stressful to the animals. It can also
> result in a high loss for the producer due to injuries and predation.
>
> Virtual Free Range™ combines the physical and psychological benefits
> of free range life with the safety and security of conventional
> agriculture. Chickens are free to roam, socialize and \"eat\" virtual
> food, which appears in the virtual world where their real food trays
> are located.
