English â€¢ Re: Yacy grabbing all the RAM - too many JVM processes
================================================================

I do agree with you about the reverse words index cause, for some hints
I came across when looking at the logs and trying to set proper settings
to reduce the RAM footprint.\
\
About the initial memory, I did set it to different values, but it does
not have any impact on the RAM used for caching.\
\
As for changing the hardware, I just upgraded my install. I intended to
dedicate some of its resources to Yacy, but if I have to commit nearly
all the RAM to this single process it might affect my other uses of the
server. Hence at the moment I do not really know if I keep on going with
Yacy.\
\
I wish there was a way to free all this cached RAM, but I do not know
the mechanics of the software and do not feel like I have enough time to
learn it. Still, maybe storing the RWI in a file (or several) could
offer a solution, even if it would be slower than caching? I guess that
developpers have already thought about this problem and this type of
solution, and have made a decision about it.\
\
So I suspect there is indeed no easy solution within my reach, beside
upgrading the hardware, which I won\'t do in a near future.\
\
In any case, thank you for your concern.
