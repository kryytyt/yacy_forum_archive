Hey bubul, in the Peer-toPeer network page (/Network.html) your peer
appears as not receiving DHT index. You should check in your Network
Configuration page (/ConfigNetwork\_p.html) that \"Index distribution\"
and \"Index receive\" are enabled. The bug occurring when switching mode
might have broken this part of your config.\
\
And again I would suggest you to upgrade to the last version (backup
your DATA folder if you want to be sure not to loose some data) as it
includes many bug fixes and support will be easier for the currently
limited number of active developers.\
More generally, when you encounter some unwanted behavior, having a look
at your logs and looking for errors is a good idea.\
\
Happy new year!
