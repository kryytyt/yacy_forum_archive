> Finland\'s speeding fines are linked to income, with penalties
> calculated on daily earnings, meaning high earners get hit with bigger
> penalties for breaking the law. So, when businessman Reima Kuisla was
> caught doing 103km/h (64mph) in an area where the speed limit is
> 80km/h (50mph), authorities turned to his 2013 tax return. He earned
> 6.5m euros (Â£4.72m) that year, so was told to hand over 54,000 euros.
>
> The scale of the fine hasn\'t gone down well with Mr Kuisla. \"Ten
> years ago I wouldn\'t have believed that I would seriously consider
> moving abroad,\" he says on his Facebook page. \"Finland is impossible
> to live in for certain kinds of people who have high incomes and
> wealth.\"
>
> In 2002, an executive at Nokia was slapped with a 116,000-euro fine
> for speeding on his Harley Davidson motorbike. His penalty was based
> on a salary of 14m euros.
