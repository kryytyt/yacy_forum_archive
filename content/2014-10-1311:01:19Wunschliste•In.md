Wunschliste â€¢ Integration von MediaWiki API (wikipedia)
=======================================================

Hi,\
probably like most, my crawls did index quite a lot a Wikipedia pages.
This is great but rather pointless at the same time.\
\
Instead of having wikipedia in the YaCy indexes it would we great if
YaCy would return a wiki snippet by default if the keyword exists in
Wikipedia.\
This could be achieved by using the MediaWiki API. YaCy could query the
keyword at the same time on its own indexes and on wikipedia. The Wiki
result (snippet or simple link), if available, could be shown in an
extra box.\
\
Without the wikipedia in the YaCy indexes there would be way more room
for other urls.
