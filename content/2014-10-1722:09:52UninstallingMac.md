Uninstalling MacOS 10.10 already.
=================================

Last night I upgraded since, given how the [Notes app constantly shits
the bed](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/10/stupid-notes-app/), I was
interested in the new iOS \"handoff\" stuff.

Well. Every time I log in, about a minute later, every app goes
hypnowheel, and even the shell can\'t fork. It stays that way for at
least 30 minutes. It made me nostalgic for Solaris 2, as I was power
cycling it for the fourth time.

Also, whenever the screen would auto-lock, I couldn\'t type my password:
mouse and keyboard events were going to the screen saver itself instead
of an unlock dialog, and I had to ssh in to kill ScreenSaverEngine.

Yup, we\'re done here.

It\'s pretty fucking ugly, too.
