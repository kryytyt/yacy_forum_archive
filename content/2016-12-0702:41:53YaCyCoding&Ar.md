It\'s not clear to me that adding unsigned hashes to the YaCy website
(which doesn\'t have TLS) would be useful; anyone doing a MITM attack
could change the hashes just as easily as changing the download
binaries.\
\
Enabling TLS on the YaCy website would be a much more important
improvement; signing the downloads with PGP would also be useful (though
less important than TLS).\

SHA1 and MD5 have been known to be insecure for years. If you want to
get some insurance against SHA2 being broken in the future, SHA3 would
make sense.\

Let\'s Encrypt is an excellent gratis CA, and last I heard they\'re
libre too.
