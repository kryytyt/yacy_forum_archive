``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
it's now possible to add an '-' in front of all constraints (all search
modifiers starting with '/') to invert the search constraint.

Example: you can search for images of cats using ```cat /image``` and
now it is possible to search for all tweets about cats which do not have
images attached with ```cat -/image```
```
