[Moscone Center Losing Forever Broken Video Art
Piece](http://sfist.com/2015/01/21/moscone_center_losing_forever_broke.php)

> Many of you may recognize the always black, powered-down,
> street-facing video panel on the side of Moscone Center West. But most
> of you probably have never seen it turned on and were not aware that
> this is actually a public artwork titled \'Facsimile\' that cost \$1.5
> million and that has spent most of the last 12 years since its
> installation totally broken. The SF Arts Commission voted last fall to
> finally dismantle and remove the thing.
>
> The 15-foot by 25-foot LED screen was intended to be mobile and
> dynamic, broadcasting its images while slowly gliding across the
> surface of the building, mounted on 100-foot-tall steel arms attached
> to the top and bottom of the glass facade. Unfortunately, the screen
> was prone to over-heating, it only functioned for about a month back
> in 2003, and during that time it even started to squeak as it moved.
