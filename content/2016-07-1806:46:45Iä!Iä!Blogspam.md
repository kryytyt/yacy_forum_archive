I\'m currently getting hit with a bunch of spam comments that aren\'t
getting trapped by Akismet that take the form of a normal sentence with
one scrmabled word in the middle, and no links. I mention this only
because this sounds like quite a movie:

> From: Sunny \<q6baircgej\@hotmail.com\> (188.143.234.155)
>
> I could watch Sc\'eldnirhs List and still be happy after reading this.

I\'m getting a tentacular *The King in Yellow* feel here.
