Ok, maybe this would be more efficient to start a crawl job with a list
of start URLs instead of starting multiple crawl jobs\...\
By the way, there is probably room for performance improvements so it
may be valuable to create a mantis issue. Did you noticed at which
number of crawljobs it started to become unreasonnably long to insert
new jobs?
