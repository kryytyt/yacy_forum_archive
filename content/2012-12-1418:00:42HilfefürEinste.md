well, this is a misunderstanding of this monitoring view!\
While YaCy does exchange/transfer indexes automatically in P2P mode, it
does \_not\_ create indexes on its own. What you see here is the
indexing queue which does only anything if \_you\_ start a web crawl.\
That means this is not \'poor performance\', this is just showing that
you have not started your own web crawl.\
\
Go here: /CrawlStartExpert\_p.html or /CrawlStartSite\_p.html and enter
a start URL. YaCy will then take web pages with not more that 120 pages
per minute. It will be a multiple of that if you start more crawls at
once because there is a protection again too much load on target servers
by reduction of crawl speed on purpose.
