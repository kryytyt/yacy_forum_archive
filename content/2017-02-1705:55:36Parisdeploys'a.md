> The boulders appeared under a flyover at Porte de La Chapelle in the
> 18th arrondissement, of northern Paris, where migrants often sleep
> rough while waiting for one of the 400 spaces in the nearby official
> humanitarian welcome centre. \[\...\]
>
> The boulders are designed to make it hard for people to take shelter
> under the bridge, however those waiting for spots at the centre are
> managing to sleep in between the huge rocks.
>
> \"It\'s difficult to sleep here,\" one migrant told Le Parisien
> newspaper after the boulders were brought in.
>
> This isn\'t the only piece of so-called \"hostile architecture\" Paris
> authorities have installed to stop migrants from making camps in the
> city.
>
> After the camps at Stalingrad Metro was cleared, metal grills were
> erected blocking off areas where refugees had set up camps, such as
> along Avenue de Flandre and the Place de la Bataille-de-Stalingrad.
