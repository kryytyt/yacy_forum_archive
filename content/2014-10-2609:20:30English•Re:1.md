Your VPS has a 30 GB drive, I think you will have to upgrade its space
in a few months or less.\
\
How long are you going to keep using YaCy for?\

If you go to /Tables\_p.html change to API change number to ALL then
search you have a html page with all the info on.\
Simply File Save As TXT and open with a txt editor where you can copy
all the various URL\'s etc and put them in a new install. But also
create a backup file of all the URLs etc\

I only know if you take your server offline you can backup all the
files, but SSH is too slow for this pursuance.
