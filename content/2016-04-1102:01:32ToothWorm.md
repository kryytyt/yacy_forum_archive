> Treatment of tooth worms varied depending on the severity of the
> patient\'s pain. Often, practitioners would try to \'smoke\' the worm
> out by heating a mixture of beeswax and henbane seed on a piece of
> iron and directing the fumes into the cavity with a funnel.
> Afterwards, the hole was filled with powered henbane seed and gum
> mastic. This may have provided temporary relief given the fact that
> henbane is a mild narcotic. Many times, though, the achy tooth had to
> be removed altogether. Some tooth-pullers mistook nerves for tooth
> worms, and extracted both the tooth and the nerve in what was
> certainly an extremely painful procedure in a period before
> anesthetics.

> The piece of art is titled \'The Tooth Worm as Hell\'s Demon.\' It was
> created in the 18th century by an unknown artist, and is carved from
> ivory. It is an incredibly intricate piece when you consider it only
> stands a little over 4 inches tall. The two halves open up to reveal a
> scene about the infernal torments of a toothache depicted as a battle
> with the tooth worm, complete with mini skulls, hellfire, and naked
> humans wielding clubs.
