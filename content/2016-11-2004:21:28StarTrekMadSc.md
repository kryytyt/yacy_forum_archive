> That Federation vessels in Star Trek seem to experience bizarre

> they can pull an effectively unlimited number of bullshit space-magic

Getting a link to a whole thread on Tumblr seems to be an impossibility,
but
[these](http://beka-tiddalik.tumblr.com/post/150425828285/roachpatrol-deadcatwithaflamethrower)
are some amusing replies:

> So to everyone else in the galaxy, all humans are basically Doc Brown.
>
> Aliens who have seen the Back to the Future movies literally don\'t
> realise that Doc Brown is meant to be funny. They\'re just like \"yes,
> that is exactly what all human scientists are like in my experience\".

> Vulcan Science Academy: Why do you need another warp core

> Humans: We\'re going to plug two of them together and see if we go
> twice as fast
>
> VSA: Last time we gave you a warp core you threw it into a sun to see
> if the sun would go twice as fast
>
> Humans: Hahaha yeah
>
> Humans: It did tho
>
> VSA: IT EXPLODED
>
> Humans: It exploded twice as fast

> Klingons: Okay we don\'t get it
>
> Vulcan Science Academy: Get what
>
> Klingons: You Vulcans are a bunch of stuffy prisses but you\'re also
> tougher, stronger, and smarter than Humans in every single way
>
> Klingons: *Why do you let them run your Federation*
>
> Vulcan Science Academy: Look
>
> Vulcan Science Academy: This is a species where if you give them two
> warp cores they don\'t do experiments on one and save the other for if
> the first one blows up
>
> Vulcan Science Academy: This is a species where if you give them two
> warp cores, they will ask for a third one, immediately plug all three
> into each other, punch a hole into an alternate universe where humans
> subscribe to an even more destructive ideological system, fight
> everyone in it because they\'re offended by that, steal *their* warp
> cores, plug *those* together, punch their way back here, then try to
> turn a nearby sun into a torus because that was what their initial
> scientific experiment was for and they didn\'t want to waste a trip.
>
> Vulcan Science Academy: They did that last week. We have the write-up
> right here. it\'s getting published in about six hundred scientific
> journals across two hundred different disciplines because of how many
> established theories their ridiculous little expedition has just
> called into question. Also, they *did* turn that sun into a torus, and
> no one actually knows how.
>
> Vulcan Science Academy: *This is why we let them do whatever the hell
> they want.*

> Klingons: \.... Can we be a part of your Federation

> Let\'s talk about the *USS Fucking Pegasus,* testbed for the first
> Starfleet cloaking device. Here we have a handful of humans working in
> secret to develop a cloaking device in violation of a treaty with the
> Romulans. They\'re playing catchup trying to develop a technology
> other species have had for a century. And what do they do? Do they
> decide to duplicate a Romulan cloaking device precisely, just see if
> they can match what other species have? Nope. They decide, hey, while
> we\'re at it, while we\'re building our *very first one of these
> things,* just to find out if this is possible, *let\'s see if we can
> make this thing phase us out of normal space so we can fly through
> planets while we\'re invisible.*

> \"But why\" said the one Vulcan in the room.

> \"Because that would *fucking rule*\" said the Humans, high-fiving
> each other and slamming cans of 24th-century Red Bull.

> Humans get mildly offended by the way they are presented in non-human

>
> Like: \"Guys, we totally wouldn\'t do that!\" But this always fails to

>
> \"That was ONE TIME.\"
>
> There\'s that movie where humans invented vaccines by just testing
> them on people. Or the one about those two humans who invented powered
> flight by crashing a bunch of prototypes. Or the one about

> And human historians go, \"Oh, uh, this is historically accurate, but
> also kind of boring.\"

> with Earth - \"what the hell is that insane thing these aliens here
> have built, let\'s go look at it\" - humans didn\'t look at them as an
> enemy or a resource or even an asset. No, the very first time humans
> met Vulcans, they tried to do the Vulcan hand thingy and they
> couldn\'t do it so they just offered a handshake, and then said
> \"let\'s get drunk and party.\" THIS IS ACTUAL LITERAL CANON,
> REMEMBER.

> Further in this vein:
>
> I will never be over the fact that during first contact a human
> offered their hand to a vulcan and the vulcan was just like \"wow
> humans are fucking wild\" and took it

> Note: Vulcan hand / finger touching is a sex thing.

> [My headcanon for
> startrek](https://roachpatrol.tumblr.com/post/139802211452/my-headcanon-for-startrek-is-that-humans-look-to)
> is that humans look, to vulcans, like a dog frathouse. Like signing on
> to a human ship is exactly that thrillingly loud and frustrating and
> fast and stupid and fun. The humans are going to dash off to a new
> sector to see if there are friends there and then they will jump up
> and down with delight and stuff their faces up against their new
> friends\' genital array. The humans are going to bark for ten minutes
> at a rock. The humans want to chase things they can\'t possibly catch
> just because they like running around. The humans are madly passionate
> about their arbitrary group identities. The humans can be divided into
> new arbitrary group identities which they will then be passionate
> about. The humans want to stick their heads out of the window of their
> starship and go \'wheee!\'. If you step on a human\'s paw they will
> act like you just killed them for about thirty seconds and then want
> more headpats. The humans can be immediately distracted from crucial
> duties by the appearance of a small animal. If you howl all the humans
> in earshot will howl louder just to show off. A human just humped your
> leg. \'Don\'t make it weird bro\' the human says. Later the human will
> dig a weird bug out of the ground and eat it.
