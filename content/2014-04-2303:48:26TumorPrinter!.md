> Removing a tumor from an organ can be a challenge when it\'s located
> in a hard to reach spot surrounded by fragile tissue, such as in the
> retroperitoneal space. Surgeons typically review CT scans prior to the
> operation, planning what approach they\'ll take in their minds. Now
> researchers at Kobe University in Japan are offering surgeons
> 3D-printed recreations of their patients\' own kidneys, including the
> tumor and surrounding vasculature, to analyze and practice on.
>
> The team uses pre-op CT scans to create 3D models of the kidneys,
> which are then transferred to the printer. The kidney is then printed
> out of two different materials so that the tumor and vasculature stand
> out from the rest of the organ. This allows the surgeons to initially
> see the tumor and vessels that will be much harder to spot during
> actual surgery.
