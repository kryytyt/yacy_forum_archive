[Ecuador verkauft China Ölbohrrechte im Amazonas-Regenwald für 80 Mio
Dollar](http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-ecuador-china-oil-20160129-story.html).
Und das Stück, um das es hier geht, ist wohl der letzte naturbelassene

> "That's essentially the only Amazon in Ecuador that hasn't been
> devastated by oil operations," said Adam Zuckerman, environmental and
> human rights campaigner at the Oakland-based nonprofit Amazon Watch.

> "The whole northern Amazon has the legacy of Texaco, now owned by
> Chevron. Andes Petroleum, which is operating in the south, already
> operated in the north --- and because of a legacy of contamination,
> and quite honestly, ethnocide in the north, the southern population
> sees this and says, 'We don't want this.'"
