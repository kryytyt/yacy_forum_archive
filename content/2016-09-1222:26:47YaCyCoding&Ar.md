How about to adjust the parser config architecture to a plugin system,
making it easy to switch parsers on and off (not dealing with all the
ext and mimes).\
Basically \.... one parser = one plugin, easy to switch on, add more or
less.\
I snooped a little around looking for light weight plugin frameworks and
I actually liked this on (which is actively developed) PF4J
<https://github.com/decebals/pf4j>\
(with one small thing I don\'t like\..... external/downloaded plugins
come by default in zip format
![:-(](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif "Sad")\
The parsers would be 1a use case for this.\
Any arguments to take it on the todo list ?
