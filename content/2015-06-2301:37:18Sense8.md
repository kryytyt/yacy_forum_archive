Sense8
======

The most important takeaway is that in a random set of eight
30-year-olds, three will know kung fu and/or gun-kata, one will be a
super-hacker, and four will have no appreciable skills of any kind.
(This is where you give the side-eye to your circle of friends.)

It wasn\'t bad \-- though I feel like nearly every idea in it had
already been exploited, better, in seasons 2 and 3 of *Orphan Black*.
*Sense8* has a much bigger travel budget, though. It\'s also just
*loaded* with pandering and clich√©s, and every sub-plot eventually
trudges toward the most obvious-possible happy ending.

And, like *Lost*, it left me wanting to scream *\"You incurious
motherfuckers!\"* at the TV multiple times. Because, by all means, never
bother to do any *experiments* to determine the limits of your new
superpower when glassy-eyed amazement will do.

I think the moral was, there is no problem you can\'t solve by punching
it.
