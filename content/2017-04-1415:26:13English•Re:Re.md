Hi Mario,\
the Re-Crawl feature re-crawls and updates already indexed documents,
but the crawl depth is there set to zero : this means if an indexed page
has new links in a new published version (not yet known by your YaCy
peer), their content won\'t be crawled and added to your local index.\
To my mind, if you want to be sure to keep a fresh index of a website
you have better regularly run a full crawl (/CrawlStartExpert.html),
eventually scheduled with the YaCy internal Process Scheduler
(/Table\_API\_p.html) or with a cron task or any convenient external
scheduler.\
\
Best regards,\
Luc
