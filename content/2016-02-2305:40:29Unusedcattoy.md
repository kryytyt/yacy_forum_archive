> My son went off to college and while cleaning his room I ran across
> this old cat toy under his bed. I tried to use it on my cat but I
> think the catnip wore off because it doesn\'t sniff at it any more
> after I washed it. My husband said to just sell everything that was
> left.

> Can return if your cat shows no interest in it or it\'s too big for
> your cat.

> Thank you.
