Mitmachen â€¢ Help: We need a big web-site for test purposes!
===========================================================

Dear colleagues!\
\
I plan a test of YaCy on ARM hardware in a special test environment. The
aim is to get reproducible results independing on provider and server
load. YaCy on ARM boards should show time performance and critical
situations.\
\
What I need is the content of some big web-sites. In order to hold this
simple, these web sites should not come from a content management system
or similar dynamic systems. It should be consist of [static
content]{style="text-decoration: underline"}.\
\
The second way is to crawl a dynamic content system in order to produce
a static mirror content for these test purposes.\
\
[Can anybody help?]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
\
Either with an image of some static content or with some acceptance to
crawl his content via Internet for one time to get such an image.\
\
Best regards, Frank.\
