YaCy Coding & Architektur â€¢ How were the ranking parameters selected?
=====================================================================

Date: 2014-02-03 08:26:19

Can anyone tell me how the default ranking parameters were selected? Was
it just manual trial and error until it looked good?\
\
I\'m a computer science student taking a grad-level course on
evolutionary computation; I\'m thinking it might be an interesting
project to automatically adjust YaCy\'s ranking based on evolutionary
algorithms using relevance feedback from the user base. Does this sound
like an interesting idea? Is there any ongoing work regarding optimizing
the ranking?\
\
Thanks.\

(I\'m posting this English post in the Coding/Architecture section
because I think it\'s most relevant there; should I have posted this in
the new English-specific section?)
