=============================================================

" Your peer cannot be reached from outside (which is not fatal, but
would be good for the YaCy network); please open your firewall for this
port and/or set a virtual server option in your router to allow
connections on this port."\

I would love to open the 8090 port and set up the virtual server. But
how can I do that? I also search online, but can anyone point that out
for me here?
