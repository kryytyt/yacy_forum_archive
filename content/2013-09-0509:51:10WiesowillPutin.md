Wieso will Putin eigentlich Snowden nicht ausliefern? [Das hat er mal in
einem Interview
erklÃ¤rt](http://en.rian.ru/russia/20130904/183164706/Russia-Will-Not-Hand-Snowden-Over-to-US--Putin.html).

> "The problem is not that we're defending Snowden. We're not. The
> problem is that we don't have a mutual extradition treaty with the
> United States," Putin said in an interview according to a transcript
> of his interview with The Associated Press and Russia's Channel One
> television.
>
> "The United States refused to sign such a treaty with us. And they do
> not extradite our criminals... who have tortured people, trafficked
> people, whose hands are covered in blood," Putin said, giving no
> further detail.
