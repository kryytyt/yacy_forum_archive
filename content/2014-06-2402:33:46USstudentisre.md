> The Chacán-Pi (Making Love) artwork by the Peruvian artist Fernando de
> la Jara has been outside Tübingen University\'s institute for
> microbiology and virology since 2001 and had previously mainly
> attracted juvenile sniggers rather than adventurous explorers.
>
> According to De la Jara, the 32-ton sculpture made out of red Veronese
> marble is meant to signify \"the gateway to the world\".
>
> The mayor of Tübingen told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper that he
> struggled to imagine how the accident could have happened, \"even when
> considering the most extreme adolescent fantasies. To reward such a
> masterly achievement with the use of 22 firefighters almost pains my
> soul.\"
