``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
added ability to return computed images also as base64-encoded version.
Just add to the request url a '.base64' extension to the file name, like

http://localhost:9000/vis/map.png.base64?text=Test&mlat=1.28373&mlon=103.84379&zoom=18
instead of
http://localhost:9000/vis/map.png?text=Test&mlat=1.28373&mlon=103.84379&zoom=18
```
