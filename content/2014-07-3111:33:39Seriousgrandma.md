> \" I had an ominous maternal Grandmother, who kept a red-handled
> fireman\'s ax by her bed, as well as an ice-pick, brick and hammer. My
> artist mother dreamt of her in the form of a grappling white octopus,
> which was perfect after the way of dreams. Old age and dissolution,
> combined with Grandma\'s innate power, unsettled. As a ghost, I see
> her swim through air as through abyssal waters.\"
