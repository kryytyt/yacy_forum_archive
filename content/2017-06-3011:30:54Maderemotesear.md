Made remote search max system load limits configurable from UI.

As reported by davide on YaCy forums (
http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=6004 ) when the
system is on high load, unless reading carefully YaCy configuration
file, it could be difficult to understand why remote search results are
not fetched.
