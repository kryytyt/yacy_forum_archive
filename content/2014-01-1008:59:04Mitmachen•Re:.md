Just taking your remark as an opportunity:\
\
I don\'t think anybody around here would have a problem with you
exploiting YaCy commercially. As long as you (or anybody else) comply
with the GPL there should be no problem. At least among the YaCy
contributors I talked to, there seems to be a consensus that everything
which helps to spread YaCy helps the project. Even if there is no direct
monetary return flow it still increases the chance to improve the
software due to increased feedback by third party developers and a
growing user base as well as the chance to earn money and/or reputation
for YaCy developers due to increased publicity caused by third parties
using YaCy for their \"products\".
