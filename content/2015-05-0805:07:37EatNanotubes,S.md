Nanotubes, Then Weave Silk Reinforced with

> The team then used a neat trick to introduce carbon nanotubes and
> graphene flakes into the spider silk. They simply sprayed the spiders
> with water containing the nanotubes or flakes and then measured the
> mechanical properties of the silk that the spiders produced.
>
> \"We measure a fracture strength up to 5.4 GPa, a Young\'s modulus up
> to 47.8 GPa and a toughness modulus up to 2.1 GPa,\" say Lepore and
> co. \"This is the highest toughness modulus for a fibre, surpassing
> synthetic polymeric high performance fibres (e.g. Kelvar49) and even
> the current toughest knotted fibers,\" they say.

> In other words, giving spiders water that is infused with carbon
> nanotubes makes them weave silk stronger than any known fiber.
