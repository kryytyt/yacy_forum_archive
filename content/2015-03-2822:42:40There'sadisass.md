[The Citizens\' Committee To Preserve The San Francisco Municipal Pipe
Organ](http://expositionorgan.org/)

> San Francisco\'s Exposition Organ is one of the last remaining
> vestiges from the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 1915.
> Considered a prime example of the art of symphonic organ building,
> this 40-ton treasure has been heard by hundreds-of-thousands of people
> and has played a pivotal role in San Francisco\'s musical culture for
> almost 100 years. \[\...\]
>
> In 1989, the Loma-Prieta earthquake damaged the organ rendering it
> inoperable. The Exposition Organ was removed for repairs and now fully
> restored is ready to be erected and heard again by citizens and
> tourists alike. \[\...\]
>
> The near fully-restored Exposition Organ is a 40-ton instrument with
> an 800+ square foot footprint. It\'s sonic field needs a room with
> several million cubic feet of space as its soundboard. Finding a
> suitable location large enough and accessible for public enjoyment is
> a big challenge.

*The Armory is a great choice for a location, just based on the
opportunity for \"pipe\" and \"organ\" jokes alone\...*
