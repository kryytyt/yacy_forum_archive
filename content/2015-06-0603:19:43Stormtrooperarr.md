> facing charges. \[\...\]
>
> A man dressed up in an elaborate Star Wars Stormtrooper costume,
> complete with a black toy laser gun, appeared on the sidewalk moments
> before school was about to release.
>
> \"I honestly opened my screen window, stuck my head out the window,
> and I was just like, \'wow,\'\" Jami Kelly, a concerned parent.

> scene, unmasked the masked crusader, arrested him, and placed him in a
> police cruiser.
>
