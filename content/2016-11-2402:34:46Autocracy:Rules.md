Several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that
Hitler\'s anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and
that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch
masses of followers and keep them aroused, enthusiastic, and in line for
the time when his organization is perfected and sufficiently powerful to
be employed effectively for political purposes.\"

> However well-intentioned, this talk assumes that Trump is prepared to
> find common ground with his many opponents, respect the institutions
> of government, and repudiate almost everything he has stood for during
> the campaign. In short, it is treating him as a \"normal\" politician.
> \[\...\]
>
> But Trump is anything but a regular politician and this has been
> anything but a regular election. \[\...\] He is probably the first
> candidate in history to win the presidency despite having been shown
> repeatedly by the national media to be a chronic liar, sexual
> predator, serial tax-avoider, and race-baiter who has attracted the
> likes of the Ku Klux Klan. Most important, Trump is the first
> candidate in memory who ran not for president but for autocrat \-- and
> won.

> I have lived in autocracies most of my life, and have spent much of my
> career writing about Vladimir Putin\'s Russia. I have learned a few
> rules for surviving in an autocracy and salvaging your sanity and
> self-respect. It might be worth considering them now:
>
> -   **Rule \#1:** *Believe the autocrat.* He means what he says.
>     Whenever you find yourself thinking, or hear others claiming, that
>     he is exaggerating, that is our innate tendency to reach for a
>     rationalization. This will happen often: humans seem to have
>     evolved to practice denial when confronted publicly with the
>     unacceptable. Back in the 1930s, *The New York Times*
>     [assured](http://www.snopes.com/1922-new-york-times-hitler/) its
>     readers that Hitler\'s anti-Semitism was all posture. \[\...\]
> -   **Rule \#2:** *Do not be taken in by small signs of normality.*
>     \[\...\] Confronted with political volatility, the markets become
>     suckers for calming rhetoric from authority figures. So do people.
>     Panic can be neutralized by falsely reassuring words \[\...\]
> -   **Rule \#3:** *Institutions will not save you.* It took Putin a
>     year to take over the Russian media and four years to dismantle
>     its electoral system; the judiciary collapsed unnoticed. The
>     capture of institutions in Turkey has been carried out even
>     faster, by a man once celebrated as the democrat to lead Turkey
>     into the EU. Poland has in less than a year undone half of a
>     quarter century\'s accomplishments in building a constitutional
>     democracy. \[\...\]
> -   **Rule \#4:** *Be outraged.* If you follow Rule \#1 and believe
>     what the autocrat-elect is saying, you will not be surprised. But
>     in the face of the impulse to normalize, it is essential to
>     maintain one\'s capacity for shock. This will lead people to call
>     you unreasonable and hysterical, and to accuse you of
>     overreacting. It is no fun to be the only hysterical person in the
>     room. Prepare yourself. \[\...\]
> -   **Rule \#5:** *Don\'t make compromises.* Like Ted Cruz, who made
>     the journey from calling Trump \"utterly amoral\" and a
>     \"pathological liar\" to endorsing him in late September to
>     praising his win as an \"amazing victory for the American
>     worker,\" Republican politicians have fallen into line.
>     Conservative pundits who broke ranks during the campaign will
>     return to the fold. Democrats in Congress will begin to make the
>     case for cooperation, for the sake of getting anything done \-- or
>     at least, they will say, minimizing the damage. \[\...\]
