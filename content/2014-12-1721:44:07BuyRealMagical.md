Is Mormon\'s Secret?](http://mormonssecret.com/pages/about-us)

> Mormon\'s Secret is the first and only site in the world selling real
> Mormon underwear (temple garments) to all adults, regardless of their
> religious affiliation. For the first time in history, online shoppers
> can purchase these magical temple garments without first joining the
> Mormon church and giving up 10% of their income in tithes. Our goal is
> to make \"magical\" underwear available to the masses for use as
> costume wear, fetish wear, and all your kinky, dress-up needs.
>
> What Makes Your Underwear Real?
>
> All of our garments follow the authentic Mormon patterns, heirloom
> stitching techniques, and traditional Masonic symbols hand-sewn on
> each garment. The underwear are available in both tops and bottoms,
> and come in both cotton and mesh fabrics for men, as well as a
> spanx-like cotton-spandex blend for women. Surprisingly, there is no
> such thing as kosher Mormon underwear. None of the religious groups
> that make and distribute temple garments go through a consecration or
> blessing process. The Mormon Church\'s secret for making magic
> underwear is part pattern and part recipe. So to sum it up, our Mormon
> underwear are as magical as you can get! Our garments even come
> packaged with a satirical yet accurate description of the actual
> Mormon underwear initiation ritual that includes nudity, biblical
> references, and magical expectations.
