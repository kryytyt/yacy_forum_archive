> If you read the news, you may think the MP3 file format was recently
> officially \"killed\" somehow, and any remaining MP3 holdouts should
> all move to AAC now. These are all simple rewrites of Fraunhofer IIS\'
> announcement that they\'re terminating the MP3 patent-licensing
> program. \[\...\]
>
> MP3 is no less alive now than it was last month or will be next year
> \-- the last known MP3 patents have simply expired. \[\...\]
>
> MP3 is very old, but it\'s the same age as JPEG, which has also long
> since been surpassed in quality by newer formats. JPEG is still
> ubiquitous not because Engadget forgot to declare its death, but
> because it\'s good enough and supported everywhere, making it the most
> pragmatic choice most of the time.
>
> AAC and other newer audio codecs can produce better quality than MP3,
> but the difference is only significant at low bitrates. At about 128
> kbps or greater, the differences between MP3 and other codecs are very
> unlikely to be noticed, so it isn\'t meaningfully better for personal
> music collections. For new music, get AAC if you want, but it\'s not
> worth spending any time replacing MP3s you already have. \[\...\]
>
> Until a few weeks ago, there had never been an audio format that was
> small enough to be practical, widely supported, and had no patent
> restrictions, forcing difficult choices and needless friction upon the
> computing world. Now, at least for audio, that friction has officially
> ended. There\'s finally a great choice without asterisks.
>
> MP3 is supported by everything, everywhere, and is now patent-free.
> There has never been another audio format as widely supported as MP3,
> it\'s good enough for almost anything, and now, *over twenty years*
> since it took the world by storm, it\'s finally free.
