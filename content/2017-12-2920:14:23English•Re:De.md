Hi Luc.\
\
Thank you very much for these links. They were very helpful.

Microformats is exactly the type of metadata I was trying to describe
and from what I can tell there are already all of the tags required for
decentralized forums, videos, markets and such.\
\
You are right. We can move forward and explore further options now.\

I\'m not finding any documentation regarding Microformats with Yacy. I
will ask on the Github page.\

I think at first we should work on making it possible for Yacy to list
comments/replies, ratings, videos and items for sale. (in that order)\

While many users might prefer a more direct approach to discussions with
friends, I do believe that a search engine based approach is necessary
for more decentralized and censorship resistant discussions (questions
and answers) between \"strangers\". I also think that the search engine
approach helps with cross network compatibility.\
\
I think as long as we can have Yacy list search results according to
their microformats tag then creating different UI\'s for different use
cases would be quite simple.\
\
For example it would be very exciting to be able to search for
\"exampleURL.com/of-a-post\" \<h-reply\>\
And this would then list all replies/comments that Yacy has found.
Someone running their own Yacy node would usually crawl his friends
pages first, therefore indexing his friends comments periodically before
search for more comments by strangers.\
\
\
I\'ll continue to update Metanet with our new findings.
