I made some progress but I still need advice.\
\
The progress: now I can access Yacy web front-end.\
\
What I did?\
\
By looking at the logs I sent, I suspect that this could be a memory
issue, so I changed these two yacy.conf parameters:\
\

Code: 
:   `javastart_Xmx=Xmx1000mjavastart_Xms=Xms300m`

\
\
The initial values for those were 600m and 90m, respectively.\
\
Also, I\'m almost certain that all these issues began after I started a
crawl on a very big and popular site. Now that my Yacy server is back,
that crawl restarted again. If my suspicion is correct, what should I do
to prevent that it harms the server once more? What signs should I look
for?\
\
Also, by looking at the log of this run, I noticed this:\
\

Code: 
:   `I 2014/11/03 13:56:31 SWITCHBOARD postprocessing deactivated: no enough ram (148797808), needed 536870912, to force change field postprocessing.minimum_ramI 2014/11/03 13:56:31 SWITCHBOARD postprocessing deactivated: too high load (5.3) > 2.5, to force change field postprocessing.maximum_loadI 2014/11/03 13:56:31 SWITCHBOARD postprocessing deactivated: constraints violated`

\
\
Is this something that needs action? What is the SWITCHBOARD?
