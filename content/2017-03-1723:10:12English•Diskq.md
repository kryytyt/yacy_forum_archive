English • Disk quota problem - new partition not available to Yacy
==================================================================

Date: 2017-03-17 23:10:12

I installed Yacy on a cloud server with 25GB available. When Yacy
reached the maximum disk quota, the crawling has been suspended. So
I\'ve upgraded my cloud and have now 80GB available. The problem is that
Yacy do not see the new partition and the disk quota availability has
not changed (e.g. Yacy can see only 2,5 GB of free disk when actually
there is 62,5 GB).\
I was said that a new installation of Yacy is required. I\'m not sure
this is the only option. May be there is another way to solve this
problem changing some config settings to see the new partition.\
\
May be the creation of a symbolic link between partitions a possible
solution ? In this case what\'s the directory to link and what should be
the name of the target directory in the larger partition ?\
\
Somebody can help me ?\
\
Thank you in advance.\
\
Kind regards\
