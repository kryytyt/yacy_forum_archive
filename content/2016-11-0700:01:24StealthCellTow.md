antagonistic GSM base station in the form of an innocuous office
printer.](https://julianoliver.com/output/stealth-cell-tower)

> Masquerading as a regular cellular service provider, Stealth Cell
> Tower surreptitiously catches phones and sends them SMSs written to
> appear they are from someone that knows the recipient. It does this
> without needing to know any phone numbers.
>
> With each response to these messages, a transcript is printed
> revealing the captured message sent, alongside the victim\'s unique
> IMSI number and other identifying information. Every now and again the
> printer also randomly calls phones in the environment and on
> answering, Stevie Wonder\'s 1984 classic hit *I Just Called To Say I
> Love You* is heard.
