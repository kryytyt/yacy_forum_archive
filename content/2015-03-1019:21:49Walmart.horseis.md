> Your use of a Domain Name that incorporates the famous Walmart mark
> constitutes trademark infringement and dilution of Walmart\'\'s
> trademark rights and unfair competition. Your use of our mark in the
> Domain Name is diluting use because it weakens the ability of the
> Walmart mark and domain name to identify a single source, namely
> Walmart. Further, your registration and use of the Domain Name
> misleads consumers into believing that some association exists between
> Walmart and you, which tarnishes the goodwill and reputation of
> Walmart\'s products, services, and trademarks.
