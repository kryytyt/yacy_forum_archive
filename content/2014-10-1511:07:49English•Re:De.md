Sorry, but no. I do not think that this is a meaningful way to solve the
expected Problem. The Version \"1.81/xxxx\" is a Developer-Version and
not a stable Release and there are only a few Peers that update its
Software frequently. Increasing the Setting for
HTTP-Server-Worker-Threads was one of the Settings that i have changed
in the beginning of hosting a YaCy-Peer on a Root-Server, i think the
People that operate a YaCy-Peer for the Public have increased this
Setting. A random Selection of the YaCy-Peers can help to avoid Problems
with overload a small amount of the YaCy-Peers.\
In my Opinion, on yacy.net should be a iframe with a real random
YaCy-Peer be present. This would show the Concept of Distribution.\

I do not have any statistics about the response times of the YaCy-Peers.
My Tool use a short timeout for querying the Peers and all Peers that
are able too respond quickly enough are market as \"available\" in my
Data-Base.\

I have exactly the same Opinion. For me the Demo-Portal is only a
Show-Case for YaCy-Newbies and not a real Product.\
