Can\'t understand the whole machine translation, but here\'s my
experience with flashcache.\
\
The hardware configuration at the time I tested flashcache was:\

-   16GB ram
-   raid 1, 1TB 7200 rpm
-   4-core xeon from 2008 (model L5420)

\
Yacy searches were too slow, with disks overloaded by the amount of I/O
ops, so I thought of setting up flashcache.\
Unfortunately, I was virtualizing Yacy under Openvz on kernel 3.6.32;
flashcache was incompatible with that, so I had to move to KVM instead
and upgrade the kernel.\
After that, I bought a cheap Kingspec SSD, 64GB, and configured
flashcache to cache the raid 1 (/dev/md0) in writethrough mode toward
the SSD.\
\
It worked very well on its first days, with read speeds in the magnitude
of 100s MB, but after less than two weeks of intense abuse on this
overloaded server, the SSD looked like damaged, with write performance
dropped down to 300÷500 ĸB/s. The write speed on the SSD were so low
that the md0 device would have been faster without the flashcache
writethrough. And so I took off the SSD and stopped using flashcache.\
\
I then found out that, apparently, all Kingspec SSDs models don\'t
support the trim command and thus lose write performance as soon as all
the memory locations are occupied. Any subsequent write on the SSD must
then be preceded by an erase to prepare the memory for writing, and this
kills the performance. Once a Kingspec is full, its write performance is
not recoverable.\
\
Also, flashcache didn\'t support trim at the time I tested it, so even a
branded SSD ([is Kingspec a brand?]{style="font-style: italic"}) with
trim support would have dropped its performance, unless a regular trim
was scheduled to run at boot.\
\
After all, flashcache looked quite nonfunctional to me.
