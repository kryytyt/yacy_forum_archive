Do you mean i should generate an additional List with an additional
Query-URL only for Peers what have the SSL-Feature enabled?\
Theoretical i can do this, the information about enabled SSL is
available. But the SSL-Port of the Peers is not available, that means i
can not offer a forwarding-mechanism for
HTTP[S]{style="font-weight: bold"}.\

In my opinion the problem is the self-signed certificate that is used by
YaCy.\
I have tried your Link and that forwards my browser to an other
Domain-Name with the HTTPS-Protocol and Port 8443. Both Chromium and
Firefox are not able to use this SSL-Encryption.\
But if i resolve the Domain-Name by hand (with dig) and enter the
IP-Address with Protocol HTTPS and Port 8443 directly than are Chromium
and Firefox able to access your YaCy-Peer, Firefox needs some extra
Mouse-Clicks for accepting (but not saving) a special Exception-Rule but
it works too.\
As far as i see this situation, the root cause for this problem is that
the certificate is only valid for the IP-Address of the YaCy-Peer and
not for a Domain-Name. A SSL-Certificate can only be valid for one Host.
A Domain-Name and an IP-Address are different Hosts (from the Point of
View of a Browser).\

Greetings\
