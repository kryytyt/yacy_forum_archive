This doesn\'t work for me on mint. The link works, the permissions look
good, yacy says that it starts and stops, but doesn\'t write anything in
the /var/log, or change anything in the DATA path, or provide the admin
console. I never see it in with the ps ax or top.\
\
I created an empty directory on the link, and tried to start yacy. It
made empty log and settings subdirectories and died without any errors
or new logs anywhere i can see yet.
