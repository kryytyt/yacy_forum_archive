![](http://www.jwz.org/images/grab-201312350_1812.png)Dear Lazyweb, the
latest iTunes update broke my script that clicks this button:

> `tell application "System Events" to tell last splitter group of first window of application process "iTunes" Â  click (first button whose description is "shuffle") end tell `{style="font-size:smaller"}

Either the button is no longer called \"shuffle\" or it\'s in a
different place or something. I have no idea how to figure out what the
names and hierarchy of these UI elements are. I don\'t even know how
anyone [figured that out last
time.](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/12/scripting-itunes-11-up-next/) Do
you?
