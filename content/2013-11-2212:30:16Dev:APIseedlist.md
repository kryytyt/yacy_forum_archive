seedlist description

**Neue Seite**

<div>

This is a description of the api at
http://localhost:8090/yacy/seedlist.html AND (it\'s the same) the format
of the YaCy bootstraping-seedlist.\
The seedlist servlet generates a \'seedlist\' file that is used for the
bootstraping process of the YaCy p2p network.\
This file is a list of peer \[\[Dev:Seed\|seed\]\]s in a
\[\[Dev:SimpleCoding\|SimpleCoding\]\] representation of a Seed DNA
property map string.\
Formal:\
seedstring = \'{\', nucleotides, \'}\'\
nucleotides = nucleotide, (\',\', nucleotide)\*\
nucleotide = seed-attibute-key, \'=\', seed-attibute-value\
Where seed-attibute-key and the corresponding seed-attibute-value is
explained in \[\[Dev:Seed\|Seed\]\].\
Then we can defined the seedlist as list of encoded seedstrings:\
seedlist = ( seedencoding, CRLF )\*\
Where the seedencoding is a \[\[Dev:SimpleCoding\|SimpleCoding\]\] of
seedstring.\
\
If you call the seedlist with http://localhost:8090/yacy/seedlist.html
you will not get a html page but a page with encoded seedstrings as
described above. There is an alternative representation of the seed list
using the same api with json encoding. The page
http://localhost:8090/yacy/seedlist.json shows the seed DNA with all the
nucleotides in clear text. The same api is available for a json-p
encoding using the following schema:
http://localhost:8090/yacy/seedlist.json?callback=seedlistobject
