![](https://www.jwz.org/images/180px-zeropointmodule.jpg)\"[NASA\'s long
awaited paper](http://www.metafilter.com/163502/Make-it-so-Number-One),
*Measurement of Impulsive Thrust from a Closed Radio-Frequency Cavity in
Vacuum*, has passed peer review and [been
published](http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.B36120in) the American
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)\'s Journal of
Propulsion and Power. They consistently measured 1.2 millinewtons per
kilowatt of thrust in a vacuum with no apparent reaction mass.\"

> vacuum that moves in the other direction.\"

Also in the comments is a glowing example of [absolutely everything that
is wrong with *Star
Trek*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_of_Nature_%28Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation%29)
in just two sentences:

> In this episode, a pair of sibling scientists show that warp drive
> propulsion is harming the very fabric of space. A sub-plot involves
> Data attempting to train his pet cat, Spot.
