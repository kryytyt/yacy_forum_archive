Renovating this proposal after two years.\
\
The advantage of using a perceptual hash library to process an already
ranked list of results before it is presented to the user is that such a
hash can be indiscriminately extracted from the text snippets which
accompany the results, as well as from thumbnail mages, and can be used
to numerically determine the visual difference between results presented
by Yacy.\
\
For text results, this could be effective at detecting and deleting
results which look very similar, and for image results it would detect
identical images which differ only by resolution or canvas ratio.\
\
To demonstrate how simple the principle is, check this program I wrote
years ago using the phash library.\
It takes as argument the filename of two images to compare, and replies
via its exit status whether the images are almost identical but differ
by resolution or cropping.\
\

Code: 
:   `/* IMAGE COMPARER PROGRAM * * Synopsis: ./program image0 image1 * Exit status: 0: the images likely (95%+) represent the same object; *              1: no resolute answer; *              2: error. * * Notes: the program is capable to recognize two images only if these * differ marginally, whether for size, aspect ratio, cropping, contrast. * Very similar images which represent marginally-different objects * don't normally match. */#include <iostream>#include <pHash.h>#define THRESHOLD 10int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {  const char *f0, *f1;  ulong64 hash0, hash1;  int distance;  f0 = argv[1];  f1 = argv[2];  cout << "Image0: " << f0 << '\n'       << "Image1: " << f1 << '\n';  if (ph_dct_imagehash(f0, hash0) != 0) return 2;  if (ph_dct_imagehash(f1, hash1) != 0) return 2;  distance = ph_hamming_distance(hash0, hash1);  cout << "Distance: " << distance << '\n';  return distance > THRESHOLD;}`
