English â€¢ Re: Problem with the crawler

A few more details : your website appears to be configured to use
TLSv1.2. By default TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.1 are disabled in the JDK 1.7 on
client connections, while the JDK 1.8 uses TLSv1.2 as default. I tried
to enable TLSV1.2 in my JDK 1.7 install, using the control panel, but
still had no success to crawl then your website with a YaCy peer running
on this Java version.\
So this makes one more good reason to upgrade to Java 1.8.
