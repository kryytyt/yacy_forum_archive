This is not a difficult process.\
One of the easiest ways is to fetch and merge all the uploaded
Seed-List-Files (from various YaCy-Peers that claim the State
\"Principal\") and you have an up to date List of all currently online
YaCy-Peers. A little bit more complicated but even more up to date is to
query all active YaCy-Peers directly for there Seed-List and merge it in
a Database (this is that my Analysis-Tool does and i needed only a few
days to Code it from ground up).\

I say my Analysis-Tool does not [evil]{style="font-style: italic"}
things, but, can you really trust me?\
I think i can develop a well Proxy-Test in lesser than 10 work hours. In
my opinion, any good programmer on this world can do the same Job in the
same Time.\

Sure?\
In YaCy exist a Bug that let it think that an incoming HTTP-Request
should handled as Proxy in cases there this HTTP-Request means the Peer
itself (the HTTP-Error-Code 403). Why can not exist an additional bug
that let YaCy think the Proxy is enabled for everyone?\
