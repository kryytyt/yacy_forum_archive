Used a text input for wiki dump import file selection.

Using an HTML "file" input was confusing (as reported by promocore on
YaCy forum : http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=5965) ,
and it only worked with MS IE/Edge on a local YaCy peer :
 - for security reasons some current major browsers such as Firefox or
Chrome do not allow to send full file path information when using a file
form input
 - the local file system selection popup doesn't make sense when you
want to import a dump on a remote YaCy server
```
