Yes, it work again, thanks !\
\
But results are strange, when searching alice miller (i\'ve crawled
website), the website names (alice-miller.com) is not shown before more
than ten results the first search and the second seem better\
\
Same probleme with peter beter, i\'ve crawled website but it\'s not
shown in first results, but second search and it find it:\
\
[http://109.238.10.103:8090/yacysearch.h \...
Offset=-60](http://109.238.10.103:8090/yacysearch.html?query=peter+beter&Enter=&contentdom=text&maximumRecords=20&startRecord=0&verify=ifexist&resource=global&nav=all&prefermaskfilter=&depth=0&constraint=&meanCount=0&timezoneOffset=-60){.postlink}\
\
But third search and his website is not shown again !\
\
And about the problem of speed in another post, when i used yacy at home
with a 30mb it show sometimes 4000 ppm but often 200 or 300 maximum (a
few mb), connexion is never really used, why not an option like memory
max, but connexion max for yacy to set maximum use of connexion ?)\
\
Yacy is very complex to use, what are LF and MH in /Crawler\_p.html near
(Speed / PPM) ?
