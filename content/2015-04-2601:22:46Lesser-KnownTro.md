Trolley Problem
Variations](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/lesser-known-trolley-problem-variations)

> The Meta-Ethical Problem:
>
> There\'s an out of control trolley speeding towards Immanuel Kant. You
> have the ability to pull a lever and change the trolley\'s path so it
> hits Jeremy Bentham instead. Jeremy Bentham clutches the only existing
> copy of Kant\'s Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals. Kant holds the
> only existing copy of Bentham\'s The Principles of Morals and
> Legislation. Both of them are shouting at you that they have recently
> started to reconsider their ethical stances.
>
> The Cancer Caper:
>
> There\'s an out of control trolley speeding towards four workers.
> Three of them are cannibalistic serial killers. One of them is a
> brilliant cancer researcher. You have the ability to pull a lever and
> change the trolley\'s path so it hits just one person. She is a
> brilliant cannibalistic serial killing cancer researcher who only
> kills lesser cancer researchers. 14% of these researchers are
> Nazi-sympathizers, and 25% don\'t use turning signals when they drive.
> Speaking of which, in this world, Hitler is still alive, but he\'s
> dying of cancer.
>
> The Ethics Teacher:
>
> There\'s an out of control trolley speeding towards four workers. You
> are on your way to teach an ethics class and this accident will make
> you extremely late. You have the ability to pull a lever and change
> the trolley\'s path so it hits just one person. This will make you
> slightly less late to your class.
>
> The Surrealist Version:
>
> There\'s an out of control trolley speeding towards four workers. You
> have the ability to pull off your head and turn it into a Chinese
> lantern. Your head floats into the sky until it takes the place of the
> sun. You look down upon the planet. It is as small as the eye of a
> moth. The moth flies away.
