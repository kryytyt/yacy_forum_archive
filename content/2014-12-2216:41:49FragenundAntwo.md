Hi,\
you can perform tests yourself for my domain \`richtercloud.de\` it you
want (port 8090 and 8443 are set up to be yacy and yacy-HTTPS ports,
maybe you can even enter the \`administration\` panel and check out some
setting read-only - again, you have explicit permission for that). I
named my peer \`richtercloud\` (because dots seem to be forbidden).\
\
\`http://yacy.info/tool\_query\` says \"The requested YaCy-Peer is
unknown.\". In the peer list is only one entry which is
\`richtercloud\`. \`http://richtercloud.de:8090/Network.html?page=1\`
says \"no remote senior/principal peer for this list known\".\
\
Thanks for you help!\
\
