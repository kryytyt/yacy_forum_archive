English â€¢ \"Search again\" & API
================================

Date: 2015-05-24 18:40:10

If I get this correctly, the \"search again\" button is intended to
allow YaCy to better refine the search results during the time frame
between the first query (\"search\") and the second one (\"search
again\"). Please correct me if I\'m wrong.\
\
Hereof, I noticed that searches performed via the web panel return
results in less time than those performed via API (yacysearch.json). Is
this because YaCy allows more time to source results for API queries?\
\
Also, how much delay is a \"good delay\" to have a degree of confidence
over the results returned?
