[Australische Grundschule verbietet den Schülern
Umarmungen](http://www.centralwesterndaily.com.au/story/543144/bunbury-schools-hugging-ban-attracts-national-attention/?cs=55).
Begründung:

> Adam Road Primary School acting principal Gemma Preston said the rule
> was enforced following injuries after "over-enthusiastic" hugs.
>
> "This behaviour was getting out of control with students hugging each
> other several times a day, and this was becoming disruptive to
> classes," she said.
