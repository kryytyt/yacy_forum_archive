[Zuckerberg Slammed for Tone-Deaf Virtual-Reality Tour of Devastated
Puerto
Rico](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/zuckerberg-slammed-for-tone-deaf-virtual-reality-tour-of-devastated-puerto-rico)

> In a move that rivaled the president tossing rolls of paper towels,
> free-throw style, into a crowd of hurricane survivors, Mark Zuckerberg
> created his own completely avoidable public-relations disaster Monday
> when he chose to demonstrate Facebook\'s new Facebook Spaces app \--
> which lets users explore real destinations as Wii-like cartoon avatars
> \-- in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. \[\...\]
>
> \"We\'re in a 360 video in Puerto Rico\... we\'re on a bridge here,
> it\'s flooded,\" grinning cartoon Zuckerberg said in the Facebook Live
> video. \"You can get a sense of some of the damage here that the
> hurricanes have done, and one of the things that\'s really magical
> about virtual reality is you can get the feeling that you\'re really
> in a place.\" \[\...\]
>
> Evidently, Zuckerberg didn\'t anticipate that his Puerto Rican tour
> might add fuel to the flames. \"This street is just completely
> flooded,\" he said. \"Can you see this behind me? I mean, this is what
> it looks like down here.\" Franklin responded: \"It\'s crazy to feel
> like you\'re in the middle of it.\" \"Yeah,\" Zuckerberg said. \"You
> want to go teleport to somewhere else?\" They then took off for the
> surface of the moon.

> Zuckerberg then went on to give Franklin a virtual high five while

showed that the future will be tone-deaf,
apparently.](https://www.gq.com/story/virtual-zuckerberg-puerto-rico)
