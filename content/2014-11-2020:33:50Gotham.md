Well, *Gotham* has now gone full Muppet-Babies. I guess we\'re done
here.

I was enjoying it when it was *\"Keyser SÃ¶ze: Year One\"* starring
Oswald Cobblepot, but now it\'s turning into what I expected it to be: a
generic cop show where we learn that everyone you\'ve ever heard of in a
Batman comic had zany middle-school adventures together.
