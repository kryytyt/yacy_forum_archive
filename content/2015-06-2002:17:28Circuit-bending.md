So then they reach inside to one of the layers and spin the knob
randomly to fuck it up. Lower layers are edges and curves. Higher layers
are faces, eyes and shoggoth ovipositors.

That part, they kinda gloss over\...

But the best part is not when they just glitch an image \-- which is a
fun kind of embossing at one end, and the \"extra eyes\" filter at the
other \-- but is when they take a net trained on some particular set of
objects and feed it static, then zoom in, and feed the output back in
repeatedly. That\'s when you converge upon the platonic ideal of those
objects, which \-- it turns out \-- tend to be Giger nightmare
landscapes. Who knew. *(I knew.)*
