Thank you Orbiter!\
How do I apply the patch, do I need to compile from source code? ( I\'m
just a user, I don\'t know how to do it with java\... )\
Or I\'ll wait for the 1.73 to be released as a Windows compiled
version.\
\
Btw, I crawled 3 hosts but one of them had a lot of links and the
crawling process went on for hours.
