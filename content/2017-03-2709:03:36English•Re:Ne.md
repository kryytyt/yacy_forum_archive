To my mind this is the meaning of the \"Search portal for your own web
pages\" setting in /ConfigBasic.html (\"Robinson Mode\" in
/ConfigNetwork\_p.html) : your peer is know by other peers, answers to
search requests and has its index shared through the /solr/select api.
Of course it also exposes itself as an OpenSearch system trough the
descriptor at /opensearchdescription.xml.\
\
If you started your peer in Peer To Peer mode (\"Community-based web
search\" setting in /ConfigBasic.html) and already indexed data, you can
also disable \"Index Receive\" in the /ConfigNetwork\_p.html page.
