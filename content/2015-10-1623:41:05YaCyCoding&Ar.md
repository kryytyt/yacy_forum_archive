YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: Extend Image preview formats support
=====================================================================

Great work, I just tested this and it looks like its working fine. I
found a glitch when I tried to open an image preview which does not work
with tiff files, but it might also be a problem with the browser. I
believe the enlarged version of the thumbnail does not go through YaCy
but is rendered by the browser directly, so this problem is not related
to your changes but it could be fixed using your new code to transfer a
re-rendered image to the enlarged view. But that is an add-on work, not
a bug.\
Thank you!
