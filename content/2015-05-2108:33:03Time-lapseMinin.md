[\"First, we cluster 86 million photos into landmarks and popular
viewpoints.](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/timelapse/) Then,
we sort the photos by date and warp each photo onto a common viewpoint.
Finally, we stabilize the appearance of the sequence to compensate for
lighting effects and minimize flicker.\"

> \"Synthesizing a photorealistic time-lapse is also very challenging,\"

> Their efforts yielded nearly 11,000 time-lapses, most of which seem to
> be cover temporal stretches of five and 10 years. Among the highlights
> are the erosion of the Briksdalsbreen Glacier in Norway, the rise of
> New York City\'s Goldman Sachs Tower, and a Swiss Guard at the Vatican
> who remains still enough over six years that he becomes every bit as
> much a part of the time-lapse as the iron door frame around him.

> In a random sample of 500 time-lapses, the researchers found nearly
> half to be \"good and interesting,\" which is to say they have no
> visible artifacts, are photorealistic, and actually show something
> changing over time; Martin points out that indoor scenes will often
> simply look like still photographs, since the changes even over a span
> of years can be too minute to notice.

> The team hopes to be able to automatically filter out the boring
> results. In the meantime, some of those \"failures\" are captivating
> in their own right. The position of the famous Wall Street Bull has
> actually moved slightly over the years, creating a blur effect and a
> quick reexamination of your assumptions about statues and mobility.
