=============================

lazyweb, how do I send Apple Pass push notifications?

Yesterday I added Apple Wallet passes to the [DNA
Lounge](https://www.dnalounge.com/) ticketing system: now when you buy a
ticket, the confirmation email comes with an attachment that will dump
the ticket into your phone such that it will automatically pop up on
your lock screen when you are in physical proximity of the club on the
day of the event. It\'s kinda neat.

What I haven\'t figured out is how to send push notifications.

When someone adds the pass to their phone, their phone registers with my
server, sending it the device ID, the serial number of the pass, and a
\"pushToken\". I should be able to take this info and tell Apple, \"tell
the device to re-download the pass from my server\".

The [Binary Provider API
document](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Appendixes/BinaryProviderAPI.html)
explains how to pack up a request to ship off to Apple. The \"device
ID\" is a 32-digit hex number, meaning a 16-byte value; and the
\"pushToken\" is a 64-digit hex number, meaning a 32-byte value, so I
assume that when that doc says \"32 byte device token\" it means the
\"pushToken\" and not the \"device ID\".

So I\'m packing it up like this, and getting neither an error message
back, nor a return connection from the phone. What am I missing?

Please do not answer with \"pay some third-party web service to do this
for you\" or \"install this multi-gigabyte black-box framework\".

**Update:** Got it working, woo\...
