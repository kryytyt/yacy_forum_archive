Ok finally I think we got it!\
The problem is that when you set \"Protection of all pages\" to \"On\"
in the /ConfigAccounts\_p.html page, it effectively prevents visiting
every pages of your peer, including those used for peer-to-peer
communication such as /yacy/hello.html\... I checked on my peers with
this setting, and yes after restart they pass in the so called
\"Junior\" mode.\
I guess you previously had a result when requesting your own
/yacy/hello.html because credentials were in your browser cache. But
when I requested it on your peer from my browser, I got the
authentication popup.\
\
So I would suggest you to just set this to Off and restart your peer,
that should then hopefully be reachable by others.\
\
I don\'t know if this was the initial intent of the \"Protection of all
pages\", but for sure it should at least be clarified in the page that
setting this to \"On\" prevents running YaCy in Senior mode\...
