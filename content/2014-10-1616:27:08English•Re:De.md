Yes, that is true. You can also enhance your robot with its own
YaCy-Network-Tracker (this is lesser than 2000 Lines of C-Code), this
kind of problem is independent of my Service.\
The only way to make YaCy \"bullet proof\" is to make it much bigger
(more than 100\'000 Peers, for just saying a number). Okay, there are a
lot of problems and weaknesses in the
Peer-to-Peer-Network-Managment-Logic inside the YaCy-Code, this makes it
difficult. In my opinion, the current existing YaCy can not benefit
enough from a growing number of peers.\

I have offered my help multiple times in the last 6 weeks, but without
any kind of reaction.\
