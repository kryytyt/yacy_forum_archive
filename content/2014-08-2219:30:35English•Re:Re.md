English â€¢ Re: Removing index entries when a page unavailable temporari

Maybe the expression \"failed verification\" is a bit misleading. As far
as I know, if a website is offline or overloaded, it doesn\'t count as
failed verification. A verification fails, if a page has changed or was
updated since it was crawled, and the search term simply isn\'t there
anymore, [but I might be wrong]{style="text-decoration: underline"}.\

I think if a failed verification occurs, only the URL(s) get removed
from the index. The words stay.
