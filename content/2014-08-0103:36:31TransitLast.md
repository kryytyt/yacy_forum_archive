> Despite an [official \"Transit-First\" policy in San
> Francisco](http://www.sf-planning.org/ftp/general_plan/I4_Transportation.htm#TRA_GEN_1_3),
> biking, walking and taking transit in our city have [been historically
> underfunded and
> under-prioritized](http://www.sfbike.org/news/city-now-aiming-for-half-of-its-own-goal-for-biking/).
> This lack of funding and priority, means Muni is too often overcrowded
> and unreliable, our bike network has dangerous gaps in it and dozens
> of people are killed just trying to walk across the streets each year.
> Even with huge growth in ridership, bicycle safety projects still only
> get about 1% of the SFMTA transportation budget, and pedestrian safety
> projects also receive only 1% of funding.
>
> Yet, despite the clear lack of dedicated space and adequate funding
> for safe, livable streets, there is a group of San Franciscans who
> think that there\'s actually too much space given to sustainable ways
> to get around.
>
> They\'ve introduced the so-called \"Restore Transportation Balance\"
> initiative on this November\'s ballot with the intent of rolling back
> the City\'s Transit-First policy and devoting more public space and
> funding to (free) parking and less to bikeways, transit lanes and
> pedestrian safety improvements. We contend that this misguided
> [\"Transit-Last\"
> measure](http://www.sfbg.com/2014/07/15/motorists-fight-back) will
> actually create more congestion, less safety on our streets, and fewer
> transportation options at a time when we need them most.
