Hello,\
\
It tried to ask a question through the english language forum but it
looks less active and flooded by spam.\
I hope someone here can help me in english (or even french
![:mrgreen:](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif "Mr. Green")
) Hello,\
\
I would like to use YaCy in order to search through some websites I
selected.\
It seems to work well but I have a problem of relevance :\
When I look for words in singular, there is no equivalence for plural, I
mean if I search for \"forums\" it\'s not possible to find the results
with only \"forum\" into, while it looks interesting to me. It\'s the
same with accented characters\... If we type a word without the special
characters like \"e\" instead of \"é\" in french, YaCy will not find any
result (except if the word is written without accent in the searched
websites.\
\
Do someone know wether it is possible to use some parameters in order to
improve the search results in this direction ?\
\
Thank you for reading, and I hope for helping
