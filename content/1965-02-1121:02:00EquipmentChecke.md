A series of commands were radioed 16-1/2 million miles to NASA\'s
Mariner IV spacecraft early today by JPL engineers from the Mariner
spaceflight operations center to check out spacecraft equipment that
will be used if Mariner is still operating normally when it reaches Mars
next July 14. The Goldstone station of the DSN was used to transmit the
commands.
