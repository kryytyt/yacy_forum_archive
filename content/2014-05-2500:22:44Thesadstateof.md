The sad state of bicycling in SF
================================

Date: 2014-05-25 00:22:44

I\'ve found myself choosing to walk instead of bike a lot more often
lately, because when I walk, absolutely no one ever attempts to murder
me, and I almost never end up screaming obscenities at strangers.

Sometimes it\'s nice to have a day with no screaming in it.

Yesterday some contractor-truck-driving motherfucker actually tried to
squeeze me off the road, presumably for having the audacity to take the
whole lane so that someone wouldn\'t turn left in front of me.

Biting in this city just gets more horrible every day.
