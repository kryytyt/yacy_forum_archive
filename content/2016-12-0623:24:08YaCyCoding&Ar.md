YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Checksum of current yacy installation file version
===============================================================================

Date: 2016-12-06 23:24:08

In order to be sure not to install a trojan horse by installing yacy,\
a text file should be added at the download link\
indicating the checksums of at least three checksums (like sha256, sha1
and md5).\
\
The effort for adding this security feature would be very small.\
\
More security:\
Additionally the download server should be a https server.\
Free https certificates are available at several hosts (e. g.
novatrend.ch)\
\
When can we expect the checksum text file on the download page?
