Hi Choey,\
\
the memory usage you assigned is jut for the Heap-Space, but there are
other Memory-spaces used in Java-Applications like YaCy - so thats
correct.\
I guess we made all processes multithreaded, that take a lot of time. A
usage of a single core isn\'t something that should be the case for
along time.\
You description sound to me, like something is not running in a normal
way - maybe we should have a look at your logfiles here.\
