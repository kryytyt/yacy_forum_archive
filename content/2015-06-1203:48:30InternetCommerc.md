This happens all the time and I don\'t know how to fix it.

Some dude tries to buy a ticket, and he sees this:

::: {style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; background:#000; color:#0F0; border:1px solid #CCC; padding: 1em; "}
**Error Processing Order**

::: {style="color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: none;"}
There was an error processing your order!\
Your order has not been completed and your credit card has not been
charged.
:::

::: {style="color: #F00; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: none;"}
â€¢ Your credit card failed to authorize (The transaction has been
declined because of an AVS mismatch. The address provided does not match
billing address of cardholder. Code N: Wrong address.)

If you are sure your address is correct, try contacting your bank to
make sure they have the correct address on file.

It is possible that your bank has placed a temporary hold on the funds
for this authorization, but they should be released after a short period
of time. Your card has NOT been charged.\

more details.

Then he goes to [look up his
order](http://www.dnalounge.com/order/status/) and he sees this:

::: {style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; background:#000; color:#0F0; border:1px solid #CCC; padding: 1em; max-width:30em; margin:auto"}
**Previous Orders**

::: {style="text-align: left; margin: auto; max-width: 35em"}
We have no orders on file for that email address and credit card.

If you entered the correct info but the order you are looking for is not
listed here, then the order was not completed, and you were not charged.

If your bank says otherwise, it\'s probably not true, though it\'s
possible that they\'ve put a temporary hold on your card. It should
clear up in a few days. Our [AVS
FAQ](http://www.dnalounge.com/store/avs.html) explains how that can
happen.

Then he sends us email that says:

> I purchased a ticket for the \[REDACTED\] show on your website. My
> bank says it is processing the transaction fee. I have waited a few
> hours now for the ticket to be emailed but it has not been. There was
> no confirmation on your site indicating that the transaction was
> successful (at least that I saw). I tried to track the order on your
> website. I got a message (attached) saying that you have no order on
> file. How long does it take to send/email the ticket? Should I try to
> buy another ticket? Will I be charged twice?

HOW CAN YOU READ THOSE WORDS AND THINK THAT YOU SUCCESSFULLY PURCHASED A
TICKET, AND THAT THE EMAIL IS ON ITS WAY?

What words could I *possibly* have said that would make it any clearer??

It\'s easy to just dismiss this as \"herp derp, people are dumb\", but
seriously, this happens *all the time*. Like, a couple times a week.
It\'s an *epidemic.*
