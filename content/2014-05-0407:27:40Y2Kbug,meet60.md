> A relic from the Cold War appears to have triggered a software glitch
> at a major air traffic control center in California Wednesday that led
> to delays and cancellations of hundreds of flights across the country.
>
> On Wednesday, a U-2 spy plane passed through the airspace monitored by
> the L.A. Air Route Traffic Control Center in Palmdale, Calif. The L.A.
> Center handles landings and departures at the region\'s major
> airports, including LAX, San Diego and Las Vegas.
>
> The computers at the L.A. Center are programmed to keep commercial
> airliners and other aircraft from colliding with each other. The U-2
> was flying at 60,000 feet, but the computers were attempting to keep
> it from colliding with planes that were actually miles beneath it.
>
> Though the exact technical causes are not known, the spy plane\'s
> altitude and route apparently overloaded a computer system called
> ERAM, which generates display data for air-traffic controllers.
> Back-up computer systems also failed.
>
> As a result, the FAA had to stop accepting flights into airspace
> managed by the L.A. Center, issuing a nationwide ground stop that
> lasted for about an hour and affected thousands of passengers.
