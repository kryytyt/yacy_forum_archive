> \"It\'s difficult to determine the exact number of dead pigs buried as
> they have decayed, but there must be so many as the stink was so
> strong that it caused several excavation workers to throw up,\" said
> the source, who had also witnessed the excavation. Earlier, he had
> told authorities that \"tens of thousands of dead pigs\" had been
> buried in the area. \[\...\]
>
> But the discovery was nevertheless alarming as it came just four years
> after more than 6,000 dead pigs were dumped into local waterways in
> Jiaxing, also in Zhejiang province. In March 2013, the rotting
> carcasses were found in Shanghai\'s Huangpu River, the source of
> drinking water for the metropolis\'s 23 million residents. \[\...\]
>
> \"Once the carcasses decay, pollutants will certainly make their way
> into the soil and the reservoir,\" said one villager who asked for
> anonymity because they have been told by authorities not to speak to
> the media.
>
> Local authorities haven\'t tested the water in the area\'s waterways,
> including the reservoir in question, for possible contamination. It\'s
> unknown how many residents drink water from the reservoir and streams
> nearby. \[\...\]
>
> The three sites on Dayin mountain have been cordoned off shortly after
> excavation work began. But drone footage obtained by Caixin on
> Wednesday shows workers in protective gear putting large black objects
> into cardboard boxes next to mounds of earth piled up after digging up
> several large pits.
>
> One Xinghong employee told Caixin that the dark objects recovered were
> decayed pig carcasses, and workers had taken boxes with animal
> remnants back to the company for cremation. The wastewater and sludge
> left in the pits was so thick that they had to use large pipes to
> clean it up, he said.
