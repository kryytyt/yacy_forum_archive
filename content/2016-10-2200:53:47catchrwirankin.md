catch rwi ranking div by zero exception
during rwi search result processing worddistance calculation is effected 
by concurrent update (normalization) of min/max ranking parameter for
wordpositions. On update of min/max the exception is raised in distance calc
and now catched. 
This concurrent update and change of ranking results is needed for speed
but should be further checked for optimization
