One of the things I\'ve wanted to do to my payphone for a while now is
put some kind of game inside it, but I was thinking more of a
choose-your-own-adventure kind of thing, where your choices are entered
on the keypad: \"press 1 to get lamp\", etc. I haven\'t come across a
script for something like that yet.
