Punching Ryan Gosling in the
Face:](https://www.gq.com/story/harrison-ford-gq-cover-story-2017)

> \"I punched Ryan Gosling in the face,\" Ford confirms. Then he adds,
> by way of clarification, that \"Ryan Gosling\'s face was where it
> should not have been.\"
>
> *Explain further, if you will.*
>
> \"His job was to be out of the range of the punch. My job was also to
> make sure that I pulled the punch. But we were moving, and the camera
> was moving, so I had to be aware of the angle to the camera to make
> the punch look good. You know, I threw about a hundred punches in the
> shooting of it, and I only hit him *once.\"*
>
> *So he should be grateful?*
>
> \"I have pointed that out.\"
>
> *And the one that did connect \-- that\'s 100 percent his fault?*
>
> \"No.\" Ford makes as though he\'s carefully weighing this. \"I mean,
> I suppose it\'s 90 percent his fault.\"
>
> *That is very \--*
>
> \" \-- generous of me.\"
>
> *He said you went to his dressing room with a bottle of scotch\...*
>
> \"I did.\"
>
> *\...and poured him a glass, then walked out with the bottle.*
>
> \"Yeah? What \-- did he fucking expect the whole bottle? You know, I
> figured one drink would fix it. That was enough.\"
