I read this thread with translate.google.com, but sadly I cant speak
German so my post will be in english (my school taught French). I
apologize, but I hope you will be able to understand me. (Mods if you
want to move this post, I understand)\
\
I got an email from Michael, and have exchanged a few emails with him
back and forth. He suggested I post here to get feedback from you.\
\
As was mentioned in the Kickstarter campaign, I am a puppy linux
developer. The ARM image that I am using is a custom Puppy Linux ARM
build specifically for this task.\
Here is a quick comparison between the OS resource usage between Rasbian
and the Puppy Linux ARM image I\'m using.\

I will upload the base SD image this weekend, so you guys can start
testing with it. Couple questions for you all. Which Java versions have
you tried? There are five that Im aware of are, JDK6, JDK7, SE6, SE7,
and EA8. I currently have tested the SE6 release, but I\'m going to try
SE7 and EA8 this weekend.\
\
I also wanted to be clear on one thing. [[I am not at any point planning
on selling these
commercially.]{style="text-decoration: underline"}]{style="font-style: italic"}
The Kickstarter is only to defer the cost of the development time being
spent on it instead of work + the cost of the reward level items. Once
that is done and the supporter rewards ship, the image will be available
for free download. If the YaCy group (that\'s you guys), want to sell SD
cards with that image on it, you are more than welcome to. I might even
be able to hook you up with a vendor if you choose to go that route. My
goal is to help promote YaCy and get more people involved. Last night on
Linux Unplugged, \[ <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgZHSbfCGHA#t=1474>
\] I said that even if my campaign fails, as long as it gets the word
out about YaCy and it gets people interested and involved; I\'ll be
happy.\
\
If any of you have other ideas or suggestions, I would love to hear
them. YaCy is a great product and I hope that it grows and becomes more
popular.\

fherb,\
I\'d be interested to see what results you get with the base image I
have. Would you be willing to test it on your end?
