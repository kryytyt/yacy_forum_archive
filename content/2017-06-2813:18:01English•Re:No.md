English โข Re: No remote results in peer-to-peer mode
====================================================

Date: 2017-06-28 13:18:01

Additional info:\
\
the computer has 8 cores / 8 threads, with 3 GB assigned to java VM.
System load sits between 10 and 12 due to all the running processes,
including Yacy.\
In \"PerformanceQueues\_p.html\" I set all the thresholds for system
load to 16, a limit which is never reached.\
\
When I pause background processes while leaving Yacy running, the system
load falls below 2 and Yacy does return search results from remote
peers. When background processes resume, load returns to 10รท12 and
remote results are no longer collected.\
\
Disk I/O is bare minimal and Yacy\'s index is less than 1M documents.
