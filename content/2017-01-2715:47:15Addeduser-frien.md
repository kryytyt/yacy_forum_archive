Added user-friendly controls over disk usage configuration settings.

As mentioned in issue #103, control settings over YaCy disk usage
already existed but lacked a user-friendly way to set them.

I added it to the Performance_p.html administration page with a little
refactoring on the "Resource Observer" fieldset for improved
accessibility and HTML standards respect.
Also added the possibility to enable/disable the autoregulation fonction
from this page.
