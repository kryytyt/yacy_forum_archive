Please enjoy [jwz mixtape
141](http://www.dnalounge.com/webcast/mixtapes/).

The track three band, [Mars
Argo](http://www.youtube.com/user/grocerybagdottv/videos), are playing
at DNA Lounge on [Fri, June
27](http://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2014/06-27d.html). You should
come.

The Youtube start/end-time editor is almost completely nonfunctional
today \-- it really just gets better every time \-- so this time I had
to eyeball it to carve off all the bullshit title-sequence branding and
credits.
