If you want your crawls to be shared with the public index then you
don\'t want \"Search portal for your own web pages\"\... there should be
an option somewhere to join the \"freeworld\" network.\
\
YaCy will only crawl what you tell it to crawl. If you use the HTTP
proxy that it provides, it will index every page you visit, but that\'s
entirely optional (and it sounds like you don\'t want to do that). So
don\'t use the proxy and you should be fine. There\'s a place in the
admin interface where you can tell it to start crawling certain
websites.
