Who\'s got a hate-on for youtubedown?
=====================================

[![](https://www.jwz.org/images/under_attack_pleas_stand_by_by_heder.png)](https://www.jwz.org/hacks/#youtubedown)In
the last 8 hours, I\'ve had 300,000 (!) downloads of
[youtubedown](https://www.jwz.org/hacks/youtubedown), from 65,000 unique
IPs, mostly in Mexico, Japan and Brazil, all with the same fake-assed
user agent, `"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36".`

Is there some botnet that tries to install youtubedown as a part of its
exploit? Or what?

*Why would you even do this?* What is going on? If this is an attempted
DDoS against me in particular, it doesn\'t even make sense!
