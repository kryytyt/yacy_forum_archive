[[Duplicates]{style="text-decoration: underline"}
appearing\...]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
We have discovered that at least in one data \"provider\" category, we
are encountering multiple / duplicate entries for the same individual
source pages.\
Remembering we have 2 servers in robinson configuration, cross-reading
each other but not writing to each other\....\
\
We typically use specially constructed RSS feeds that crawl a target
site based on an initial \'sample\' list and harvest what is there.\
What is important for us is [[to go back in
history]{style="text-decoration: underline"}]{style="font-style: italic"}
and collect as many \'archival\' documents as possible in the target
site address.\
Typically we seek to collect [Up To 1000 document
entries]{style="text-decoration: underline"} at a time.\
\
How do we ensure we can collect earlier documents beyond the initial
\'Up to 1000\'?\
\
As we crawl daily and in some cases hourly, it appears that the
Restriction [[Do Not Accept
Duplicates]{style="text-decoration: underline"}]{style="font-weight: bold"}
of the same page [is not being
respected]{style="text-decoration: underline"}.\
\
Duplicates we find have different session numbers, but ultimately are
identically the same target document.\
\
How do we remove duplicates in an automated manner?\
Now that we have 51 million web edges, it is no longer feasible to
attempt to find and clean this by hand.\
Ideally, we want the 1st copy of each collected document.\
Thank you!\
\
As a recurring question to address, will shifting from a collection of
stand-alone Robinson servers to a closed environment P2P environment of
only our own servers \'clean\' this?\
What are the downsides, please? Thank you.
