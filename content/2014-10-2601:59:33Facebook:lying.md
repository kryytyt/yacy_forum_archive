Facebook: lying liars. Water: wet.

Hey, remember when Facebook\'s hateful \"real names\" policy got a lot
of press because they went nuclear on a bunch of queens? And then they
put out a contentless, fawning press release with a fauxpology in it?

And remember when they then they got a ton of shamefully credulous press
from people saying, \"Well, that\'s all better then\"?

And remember when people like me said, \"You know, maybe you should save
your applause for *after* they\'ve changed either their official policy
or their demonstrated behavior, or both, because they *haven\'t\",* and
nobody listened?

Well guess what, they just banned another friend of mine *yesterday* for
using his DJ handle instead of his real name.

Fuck Facebook, and fuck every so-called \"journalist\" who reposts
corporate press releases with zero skepticism.
