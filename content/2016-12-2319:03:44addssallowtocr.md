``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
add/allow to create a bookmark of result viewed via urlproxy.
For this on the header of the viewed result a "add bookmark" button is
available (for authenticated users).
Currently the bookmark is added to a (virtual) bookmark folder "/proxy"
w/o any additional tags etc.
```
