Like I [keep
saying:](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/10/if-you-work-for-facebook-quit/)

If you work for Facebook, quit. It is morally indefensible for you to
use your skills to make that company more powerful. By working there,
you are making the world an objectively worse place. I\'m sure you can
find a job working for a company that you don\'t have to *apologize* for
all the time.

You can *do it.* I *believe* in you.
