well that looks like there went something wrong. There should be an
error in the log; this can be seen either in /ViewLog\_p.html directly
after the crawl start or in DATA/LOG/yacy00.log\
\
A different approach (if the crawl actuall would have been started,
which seems not to be the case) is a look inside the rejected urls at
/IndexCreateParserErrors\_p.html\
\
But anyway: from the auto-generated Must-match entry I can see that you
must be running an non-updated 1.3er version. right? If yes, please try
an update using the auto-udater at /ConfigUpdate\_p.html\
\
To reproduce the problem I started the same crawl at blogdosakamoto .
blogosfera . uol . com . br but this was successful! Please have a look
if updating solves the problem.
