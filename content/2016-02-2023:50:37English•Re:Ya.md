English â€¢ Re: YaCy as ZeroNet search engine
===========================================

Date: 2016-02-20 23:50:37

ZeroNet stores visited web pages in a local data path. That path can
easily indexed with YaCy. The indexed file path could then be translated
into the ZeroNet URL schema using the site hash which is also in the
data path. That requires some coding and extra logic in the crawler. So
far this appears to be an option to access ZeroNet content. The next
question to solve is: how should ZeroNet indexes be shared. It requires
a public network which handles only localhost addresses. Thats strange,
but obviously required.
