YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: Spreading YaCy on web servers
==============================================================

It seems this post doesn\'t interest much people\... Anyway,
reconsidering what I said, I think now that developing a Apache http
module would not be the most releveant idea. But I still think what
would really make sense would be to be able to deploy YaCy as a standard
war in any J2EE compliant server (Tomcat, JBoss\...). For any
organization already having applications deployed on this kind of server
it would really be helpful if they wish to expose some website content
on YaCy network. Is it this way YaCy pro section proceed? I don\'t find
any document on the wiki or in the build.xml to help building a standard
war\...
