Mitmachen â€¢ Preventing \"super-indexing\"
=========================================

Date: 2014-10-10 11:58:39

Hi,\
does Yacy has a mechanism to prevent the indexing of the same content
\"too many times\"? I would call it \"super-indexing\" if for example
100 servers index wikipedia. The index would be spread anyway between
the servers. Is there a mechanism implemented which can be used to avoid
the indexing of widely available content?
