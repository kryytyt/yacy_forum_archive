The Solr export is simply a zip file of the Solr data directory which
contains lucene index files in binary form. I wonder how you process
them but as far as I know there is no limit to any field at all. If any
of the fields are at the size you write then the size was like that in
the original html that was indexed. Do you actually parse the lucene
index files?
