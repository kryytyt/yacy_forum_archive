Hi sixcooler,\
i am fiddling around a bit. The current settings are:\
Transparent Proxy: on\
Access only with qualified account: on (admin, \_\_\_\_\_\_) /unchanged\
Use Proxy Account: on\
\
The rest is rather vanilla (i think\...).\
However, I get this traffic almost instantly when I start yacy. I would
not care much if I would knew its just my host. But it hit me that the
YaCy network might have found an other use by blackhats.
