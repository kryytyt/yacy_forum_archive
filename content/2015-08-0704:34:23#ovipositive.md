> Yesssss\... your body will do nicely for the young ones.
>
> How do you like YOUR eggs? Introducing the Splorch! It is an
> ovipositor designed for all those xenomorph fans out there who like
> the idea of alien eggs and impregnation. Made of soft platinum
> silicone, the Splorch is stretchy enough to handle chicken egg-sized
> gelatin eggs. Although we do not supply these directly, all Splorch
> orders will include a free 6-egg mold.
>
> Thank you for being such an excellent host.

Krubera:

> A new version of our popular Splorch ovipositor, the Krubera is sure
> to make you squirm! Feel it\'s tube-like member bulge with eggs as it
> slides its way up into you, eager to implant it\'s offspring deep
> inside.
>
> The Krubera features a subtly textured 11\" shaft, and a 12\' overall
> length. When gelatin eggs are squeezed through, it distends, rippling
> and writhing, the eggs sliding upward until they gently pop out the
> end.
>
> As with the Splorch, the Krubera does not come with eggs. A free mold
> is provided for making your own.
