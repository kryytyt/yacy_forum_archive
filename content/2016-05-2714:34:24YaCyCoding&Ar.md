\@Orbiter, thank you for having merged Pull Request
[\#52](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/pull/52){.postlink}.\
I don\'t know if you saw my comment after this request was close, so I
copy it here :\
\
Do you plan to create an official account for yacy organization on
DockerHub?\
If so YaCy docker image building could be fully automated from latest
commits on main yacy git repository\...\
I am not member of yacy main github repository so I still have to
manually merge latest commits to my own repository clone, wich then
automatically triggers a docker build on
<https://hub.docker.com/r/luccioman/yacy/..>.
