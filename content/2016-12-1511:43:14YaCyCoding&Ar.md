YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: github bin releases
====================================================

Date: 2016-12-15 11:43:14

Hello, I experimented a bit more with the process by creating a release
on my own YaCy fork
([Release\_1.91.9411-alpha](https://github.com/luccioman/yacy_search_server/releases/tag/Release_1.91.9411-alpha){.postlink}).
The process is really simple, and as you can see the release include the
usual sources packages but also the tar.gz and debian binary files I
added. The most problematic part would finally to have MS Windows, Mac
OS and Linux build machines if we would like to include binaries for
these platforms and not only a cross platform standard tar.gz or zip.\
\
So what about releasing minor versions of YaCy binary builds on a more
regular basis?\
\
I also tested if the release page could be used as an alternative update
location, by adding a

Code: 
:   `network.unit.update.location3 = http://github.com/luccioman/yacy_search_server/releases`

line in the defaults/yacy.network.freeworl.unit of a 1.90 peer. YaCy
updater effectively find my alpha release\... but unfortunately, with
1.90 and also with latest current code it doesn\'t work. Worse, it seems
to work but indeed fails and lets YaCy in a state where it can no more
boot. The root cause is that for some reason, downloading the release
with a browser works, but YaCy updater is rejected : GitHub redirects to
Amazon S3 (correctly handled by YaCy HTTPClient), but then returns a
HTTP 403 status.\
The next steps to fix are the following :\
- HTTP 403 status is ignored and YaCy creates a DATA/RELEASE/\...tar.gz
file containing the HTTP message\
- The install button is then enabled : when launching the install
process, tar.gz extraction failure is ignored and the update script is
launched, deleting all the YaCY lib/\*.jar files, then preventing any
restart\...\
\
To conclude, using the GitHub release page as an alternative update
location looks promising, but some work is still needed
