*\"Well son, a funny thing about regret is, that it\'s better to regret
something you have done, than to regret something you haven\'t done.\"*

A few weeks ago a certain fellow came up to me and said:

I\'m as surprised as you are that I chose not to pursue this. Much as I
would *love* to have a gigantic BSOD-o-Tron\... I mean, it has so much
to recommend it! It\'s 25\'Ã—15\'! It probably uses a *ludicrously
gargantuan* amount of power! I can\'t even guess how much it weighs \--
but I\'ll guess that the front of my building can\'t support that
weight. And I\'ll further guess that at least 100 pounds of that weight
is a decade\'s worth of electrocuted pigeon carcasses! And, lest we
forget, it hasn\'t actually *worked* since 2003!

What\'s not to love?
