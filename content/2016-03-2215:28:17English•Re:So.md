Hello, as far as I know, YaCy is currently designed to index resources
in a given network (internet, intranet, custom\...), and to provide
access and search trough its index to all users inside this network.\
\
But inside an intranet, I guess the following configuration example
should work (I did not tested it) and could fit your needs :\
- one wiki instance\
- one issue tracker\
- one YaCy instance having full access without authentication to wiki
and issue tracker resources\
- wiki, tracker and YaCy instances access is restricted to intranet
users by the same CAS SSO server\
\
But of course things become more complicated if you want multiple YaCy
peers to run on each intranet user computer, or if full access can not
be open between resources servers and YaCy server, or if different
credentials have to be applied to each resource\... I think adapting
YaCy to these needs represent a non negligible amount of work.
