==================================================

Hi luc, sorry for the delay, I just tested an \'ant clean all
distMacApp\' without changes and it is working beautifully!\
I checked the location of the storage path in \~/Library: you choosed
the path \~/Library/Application Support/net.yacy.YaCy/DATA for the data
folder.\
This is different from the previous path as described in the wiki but I
think it is a well-choosen path. It will give us the opportunity to use
the paths net.yacy.YaCy\_X (\...name not yet known\...) once we have
\'YaCy2\'-Components, and we will have many of them (!). So lets keep
this. Good work!\
\
This is so good that we should have another release soon. Any emergency
task to be done before it?
