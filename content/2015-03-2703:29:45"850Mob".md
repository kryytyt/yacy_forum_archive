> At least four deputies at County Jail No. 4 at 850 Bryant St.
> threatened inmates with violence or withheld food if they did not
> fight each other, gladiator-style, for the entertainment of the
> deputies, Adachi said.
>
> Adachi said the ringleader in these fights was Deputy Scott Neu, who
> was accused in 2006 of forcing inmates to perform sexual acts on him.
> \[\...\]
>
> The public defender\'s office hired a private investigator to look
> into the claims, and the attorneys were going to wait until their
> clients were safe and out of the jail before they came forward with
> the allegations. But they received word that another fight was planned
> for next week, Adachi said.
