Hello and welcome frenchuser666!\
\
To my mind there is no legal issue with YaCy use in France, especially
for personnal use in peer-to-peer mode. Providing links to some illegal
pages among other search results should not be an issue : it really is
not the same as publishing an article which contains links to some
illegal material you eventually endorse.\
What\'s more, YaCy has a black listing feature that allow you to prevent
storing links or indexing sites you really don\'t want to. The black
lists can be shared and reused between YaCy users.\
\
To my mind an eventually illegal use of YaCy would be to configure it as
a search portal publicly available, whose unique purpose would be to
provide links to illegal material you index, eventually with a custom
main page mentionning the purpose of this portal.\

PS : I also think the forum search is broken. Maybe \@Orbiter can tell
us more?
