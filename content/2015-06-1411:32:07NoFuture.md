No Future
=========

Date: 2015-06-14 11:32:07

I just re-read [*The
Invisibles*](http://www.amazon.com/Invisibles-Various/dp/1401234593)
from the beginning, and wow, is it drug-addled perfection. A lot of
Morrison\'s stuff swings the needle a little too far toward \"manic
gonzo incoherence\" and away from \"story\", but this series straddles
the line very well. It\'s also much more amusing after having read his
semi-autobiography
*[Supergods](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400069122)*, which goes
into a lot of detail about how insane his life was at the time, and how
he saw the comic as some kind of sympathetic-magic invocation.

In particular, I would like to share these panels, written in 1997,
showing what morning-commute radio was to be like in San Francisco in
the far-future year of ***2012:***

Let\'s review:

-   Nanobots, comma, plague of;
-   People know who Terence McKenna is, comma, take seriously;
-   Schwa face;
-   Mayan apocalypse;
-   Motorcycle HUD pr0n;
-   Max Headroom broadcast hackers, comma, terrorist;
-   Swearing!

*No Future,* indeed.

On the other hand: drag queens, clowns. Ok, fair. There\'s really quite
a lot of that sort of thing in my life, here in The Future.

And finally, we\'ll just file this under \"Wow, do I know *that* feel\":
