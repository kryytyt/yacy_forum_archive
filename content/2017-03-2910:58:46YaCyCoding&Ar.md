YaCy Coding & Architecture • The YaCy Grid
==========================================

Date: 2017-03-29 10:58:46

I\'m actually working hard to make a YaCy/2, now called \"YaCy Grid\".\
The main idea is currently, that this becomes a large-scale search
appliance \-- for the first step.\
In a second step, we can do two things: replace the old code parts in
\"Legacy YaCy\" with the grid elements and secondly, turn the YaCy Grid
into a peer-to-peer architecture (again).\
YaCy Grid is therefore a \'professional YaCy\' with the vision that it
stays a modern piece of software that may power the next-generation p2p
search.\

I posted a milestone plan and an architecture picture here:\
