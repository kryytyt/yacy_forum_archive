> The human thumb has a really dynamic movement, the opposing movements
> working together make the thumb more functional than a single finger.
> The Third Thumb replicates these movements by using two motors pulling
> against the natural tension of a flexible 3d printed material. The
> motors are controlled by two pressure sensors retrofitted into your
> shoes, under your toes, and communicate to the thumb via Bluetooth
> connection.
