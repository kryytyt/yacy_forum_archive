If the law impedes your ability to make a profit, it\'s ok to ignore that law, right?

author wants to make this about tech-hate, but really it\'s about SFPD
and SFMTA choosing to not enforce the law:

[Food delivery services are clogging the streets and blocking

Fuck you, Kobi Mohan. If your business is unsustainable, then you can
either, A) fix your business model to be profitable, or B) fail.
Declaring yourself a magical unicorn who doesn\'t have to follow the
laws that other people do just makes you a *parasite.*

You\'re not even some dot-com whose VC has his hand up the Mayor\'s ass
\-- what makes you think you get to participate in this Libertarian
I-got-mine \"disruption\" con, too?

Anyone know what these \"special permits\" that UPS and FedEx have
allow? I had always assumed that when UPS and FedEx park in the bike
lane \-- and by \"when\" I mean \"always\" \-- that they were straight
up breaking the law, with SFPD straight up refusing to enforce the law
on them.

If they are actually legally allowed to park there, I\'ll be even more
enraged. Are they?

I hope this is just a confused and roundabout way of saying \"vehicles
with commercial plates are allowed to use the \'loading zone\' spots
that exist on every non-residential block in the city.\"

A speedy commute back to the suburbs is the only priority. If you\'re
not actually in a car, go fuck yourself:

It\'s the 21st Goddamned Century: why can\'t I act like a human
red-light camera, take a phone-photo of the license plate of a car in
the bike lane, text it to 311, and have a ticket automatically issued
based on the timestamp and GPS? Yes, I will *gladly* click the checkbox
saying that I will testify to this in court if necessary.
