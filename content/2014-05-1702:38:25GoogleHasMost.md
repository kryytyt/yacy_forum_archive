> Despite the fact that I spend hundreds of dollars a year and hours of
> work to host my own email server, Google has about half of my personal
> email! Last year, Google delivered 57% of the emails in my inbox that
> I replied to. They have delivered more than a third of all the email
> I\'ve replied to every year since 2006 and more than half since 2010.
> On the upside, there is some indication that the proportion is going
> down. So far this year, only 51% of the emails I\'ve replied to
> arrived from Google. \[\...\]
>
> I\'ve broken down the proportions of emails I received that come from
> Google in the graph below for all email (top) and for emails I have
> replied to (bottom). In the graphs, the size of the dots represents
> the total number of emails counted to make that proportion.
