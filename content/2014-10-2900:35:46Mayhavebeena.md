[![](http://www.jwz.org/images/8vjxkt2.jpg)The Dartmouth: This editorial
has been revised to reflect the following
correction:](http://thedartmouth.com/2014/10/17/opinion/verbum-ultimum-abolish-the-greek-system)

> Correction appended (Oct. 24, 2014):
>
> A front-page editorial published Oct. 17 calling for the abolition of
> the Greek system at Dartmouth stated that in the late 1980s, Alpha
> Delta fraternity pledges were forced to perform oral sex on an
> ejaculating dildo. The editorial should have stated that some pledges
> were required to simulate oral sex on an inanimate object, which the
> house\'s advisor now says may have been a banana.
