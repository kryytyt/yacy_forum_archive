HI..thanks for the suggestion!\
Here is what I got\...\
total used free shared buffers cached\
Mem: 2.0G 71M 1.9G 3.8M 0B 40M\
-/+ buffers/cache: 31M 2.0G\
Swap: 1.0G 0B 1.0G\
\
In your experienced opinion, please, how much is still available, all
thing considered?\
It is running at 750m, now, but it is painfully slow\...almost stopping,
many times.\
In fact, sometimes it will not open a browser window, at all, though the
daemon notice displays when started from the command line with
./startYACY.sh in Ubuntu. It displays various out of memory notices.\
Many thanks!
