> On Thursday night, MSNBC's signal abruptly froze during a broadcast of
> Hardball with Chris Matthews and repeated the word "Russia" over and
> over.

Aber macht euch keine Sorgen, das ist ja bloß ein Einzelfall.

> On Thursday, C-SPAN's broadcast of proceedings in the U.S. House of
> Representatives got bumped off the air during an anti-Trump speech by
> Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA). C-SPAN's signal was replaced by
> approximately 10 minutes of programming from Russia Today

Na gut, ZWEI Einzelfälle.

> Mediaite also said that on Thursday, "(T)he lights mysteriously went
> out during the confirmation hearing for Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.)
> while he was being vetted by the Senate Intelligence Committee."

OK OK, DREI Einzelfälle!1!! :-)
