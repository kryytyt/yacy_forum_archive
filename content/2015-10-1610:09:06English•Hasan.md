I have been trying to crawl <http://www.justiceparty.com.au> and can
only seem to receive 1 URL even though there are more pages.\
Yahoo has the links.\
Google does not.\
Msn Does not.\
\
Even tried [http://www.justiceparty.com.au/\#!domest \...
form/i8yml](http://www.justiceparty.com.au/#!domestic-violence-law-reform/i8yml){.postlink}\
Yacy may have been blocked but the robots.txt does no say that.
