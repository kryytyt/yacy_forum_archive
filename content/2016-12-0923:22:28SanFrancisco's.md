> The SFPUC is aware that customers in San Francisco and throughout our
> service area started to report taste and odor issues with their tap
> water on Thursday, December 1st. We understand that there continues to
> be a reported \"earthy/musty\" taste to the water. \[\...\]
>
> On average, 85% of the water we provide to you, our customers, comes
> from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. The rest of the water we supply comes
> from local Bay Area reservoirs. All of our reservoirs deliver
> high-quality water to 2.6 million customers throughout the Bay Area.
> As part of normal operations, our customers receive both local
> reservoir water and Hetch Hetchy water.
>
> Why does your water taste different now?
>
> The week of November 28th, our operators made routine operational
> changes to the system to bring local reservoir water levels down in
> anticipation of rains. This included taking water out of San Antonio
> Reservoir in the East Bay, and treating it at our Sunol Valley Water
> Treatment Plant. We also reduced the flow of water coming from Hetch
> Hetchy Reservoir. That operational activity stirred up sediments in
> the pipeline. Complaints tracked the flow of the sediments, San
> Antonio algae levels were extremely low, and standard odor tests were
> normal. Thus, the pipeline sediment was believed to be the initial
> source of the taste and odor issues.
>
> Recent chemical testing in the system has shown the presence of a
> dissolved compound called Geosmin that is a natural byproduct of blue
> green algae in the water. Geosmin is found in foods like fish, grapes,
> wine, and beets. This dissolved compound is not harmful from a public
> health standard. However, this compound can cause taste and odor
> issues in the drinking water supply, even if there are extremely small
> amounts of it in the water (parts per trillion).

> More than two-thirds of the Bay Area\'s water supply comes from

> one, local water districts are competing with many others around the
> state for limited supplies.

[A Hoodline commenter
said](http://hoodline.com/2016/12/does-your-tap-water-taste-weird):

> The reservoirs in Alameda and San Mateo counties are part of the SF
> Department of Water & Power system, as are other reservoirs upstream
> between SF and Hetch Hetchy. SF sells most of the water to other
> agencies on multi-decade contracts while using the electricity
> generated to power government facilities and Muni (power was
> originally supposed to be for citizens of SF). Blending has gone on
> for many years in order to balance storage and demand throughout the
> system. I\'ve generally noticed a switch shortly after a few heavy
> rains in fall/winter and when algae requires additional chloramine. It
> will be interesting to hear feedback when local SF groundwater is
> added to the mix for the western half of the city in the near future.

\...but in a quick search, I wasn\'t able to find a summary of what the
economics of all this are, or the status of PG&E\'s presumed ongoing
effort to strangle [Clean Power
SF](http://sfwater.org/index.aspx?page=998).

I think it was in [Paolo Bacigalupi\'s *The Water
Knife*](https://www.amazon.com/Water-Knife-Paolo-Bacigalupi/dp/080417153X/)
where someone characterized aquifers as buried glaciers: they spent a
hundred thousand years accumulating and rolling south until they got
spaded under, and now we\'re draining them three orders of magnitude
faster than that.
