Star Trek Beyond
================

It\'s pretty dumb, doesn\'t make a whole lot of sense, and has the kind
of disregard for basic physics that you\'d expect from *2 Fast 2
Federation*. But to their credit, it\'s an actual new story, rather than
trotting out Khan again or something, and the plot involves no time
travel.

It suffered from the kind of flat, no-depth-of-field,
impossible-to-parse visual effects that you see when the effects are
rendered with 3D in mind. I hate 3D so much. It ruins the look of movies
even when you watch the *flat* version because it leads to terrible
cinematography decisions. The *Ringworld* starbase was just ridiculous.

Was anyone else distracted by the fact that CV Dazzle Ninja Woman had
the same accent as Helena from *Orphan Black?* I kept expecting her to
talk about her sestras.

But anyway, the good news is that [*Star Trek
Continues*](http://www.startrekcontinues.com/) is now up to 6 episodes.
It\'s a fan-made set of new episodes of TOS and it\'s pretty well done.
It\'s goofy in almost exactly the same way TOS was goofy. [Playlist

You should just watch this instead.
