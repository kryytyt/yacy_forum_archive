Hi Biolizard89 and Orbiter,\
\
\
Very, interesting, indeed. The very critical point in this research from
my point of view is, to get the link betwen queries and their actual
endpoints in the SERP - hope, you\'ve got the opportunities to go on and
accomplish your work!\
\
\@Orbiter - is there a way to get fully anonymized listings of queries
accomplished in the yacy-network? And, to get them linked them with
results choosen finally? As long as they do not leave the users
terminal? What, if the users may deliberately decide to send these
key-value pairs, anonymously and anonymized, to a central and open
database server - open for researchers around the world?\
\
I think, the idea behind is not only important, but also critical,
challenging and a little bit to demanding, not to try to get it
accomplished by some \'crowd-intelliengce\' approach \... don\'t you
think so?\
\
\
Best
