> After 18 years as a social cornerstone of the South Beach/SoMa
> neighborhood, we, the owners of the Brickhouse Cafe, have the
> opportunity to buy our property. Help us keep it out of the hands of
> an overseas hotel chain and keep the Brickhouse thriving for years to
> come! We are seeking \$100,000 in donations to exercise our right of
> first refusal, and secure our foothold in the property. This will give
> us the time to complete of our pre-approved loan to fully purchase the
> Brickhouse property.
