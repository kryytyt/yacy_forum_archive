> A Golden Orb Weaver (Nephila edulis) is sedated with carbon dioxide
> gas, and pinned around her limbs and abdomen, keeping her in place
> without causing any harm. Silk is pulled by tweezer from the
> spinnerets and attached to the spool with a dab of glue after which
> the motor is started to begin harvesting. The silk produced here
> consists mainly of major ampullate silk which forms the main structure
> of the web (like scaffolding) and minor ampullate silk, which is used
> to form the main spiral of the spider\'s web. Nephila edulis females
> can produce up to six different types of silk.
>
> It\'s possible to harvest between 30-80 metres of silk in one go,
> after which the spider can be released back to its web to feed ready
> for reeling another day.
