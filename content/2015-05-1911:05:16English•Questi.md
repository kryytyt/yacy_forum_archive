English â€¢ Questions on schema field: crawldepth\_i
==================================================

I see the solr schema has a field named
[crawldepth\_i]{style="font-style: italic"}.\
\
Two questions arise:\
\

1.  How is the depth measured? Since the crawler may find the same
    document referenced from many different paths, the depth at which
    the document is located is relative. Is the lowest known depth
    assigned to crawldepth\_i?
2.  Since I\'m crawling a CMS where all the \"significant\" documents
    lie at the same depth, with the exception of a minority of
    \"insignificant\" node pages such as home pages or indexes, may I
    remove the crawldepth\_i field from my index without compromising
    anything? Unchecking the box from /IndexSchema\_p.html will take
    immediate effect?
