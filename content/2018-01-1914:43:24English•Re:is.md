========================================

Code: 
:   `"apt-get install wkhtmltopdf imagemagick xvfb ghostscript"`

Seems to have done the trick and I now see pdf snapshots.\
\
I\'m noticing however that these snapshots only include text and no
images from the pages.\
I was hoping to get a preview of pages that could be rendered with the
results, but I guess that\'s just a dirty approach to what should be
microformats stuff.\
\
I guess for now I\'m glad I got the snapshots working. Just not sure
what to do with them
