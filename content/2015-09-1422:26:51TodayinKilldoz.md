[Vivienne Westwood Drives Tank To David Cameron\'s House In Fracking
Protest](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/11/-dame-vivienne-westwood-drives-tank-to-david-camerons-house-in-fracking-protest_n_8122594.html?1441980888)

> The 74-year-old came out in force to oppose the new fracking licenses
> which are being pushed through parts of northern England.
>
> Westwood said: \"Cameron accuses foreign leaders such as President
> Gaddafi and President Assad of supposedly using chemicals on their own
> people as a justification for regime change. But he is doing precisely
> that here in Britain by forcing toxic, life-threatening fracking
> chemicals on his own people against the advice of his own chief
> scientist.
>
> \"It\'s time for regime change in Britain. Cameron plans to force
> householders to surrender their land and endure fracking underneath
> their homes. Britons no longer have any choice but to fight back.\"
