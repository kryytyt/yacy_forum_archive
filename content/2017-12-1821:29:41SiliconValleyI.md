[Ted Chiang: \"When Silicon Valley tries to imagine superintelligence,
what it comes up with is no-holds-barred
capitalism.\"](https://www.buzzfeed.com/tedchiang/the-real-danger-to-civilization-isnt-ai-its-runaway?utm_term=.brwPyvVj3#.urLj8eWxV)

> good idea. Then I realized that we are already surrounded by machines

> There are industry observers talking about the need for AIs to have a

> goals are aligned with human goals. I find these suggestions ironic

> It\'s no surprise that Silicon Valley capitalists don\'t want to think

> devil in their own image, a boogeyman whose excesses are precisely
> their own.
