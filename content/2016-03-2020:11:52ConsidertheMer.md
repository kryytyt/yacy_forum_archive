Brief History of Pubic Wigs in

> \"Cleopatra was known for her beautiful, long, luxurious pubic hair,
> which she proudly wore brushed and oiled, and she was known to admire
> \-- and display \-- her pubic hair in the shiny marble floors and the
> light, diaphanous gowns of the time,\" relates Sayer, who works in
> Burbank at the Make-up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild. \"Otherwise,
> in ancient Egypt, most citizens \-- noble or otherwise \-- were
> required to shave their pubic and body hair to rid themselves of lice.
> Noble and wealthy people were known to wear wigs \... and it is
> thought that a type of merkin was fashionable; it could be worn to
> show that they were rich enough to maintain their pubic hair.\"

> Industry folks who\'ve worked with merkins unfurl their anecdotes with
> relish, in part because behind-the-scenes gigs on film sets can be
> thankless. You spend 12 hours on a pubic piece \-- perming the thatch,
> threading the short hairs to a lace front, and finally trimming the
> thing \-- before some striving youngster places your creation in its
> ultimate destination. (\"I have not had the pleasure \-- or misfortune
> \-- of putting one on,\" Ladek says.) And after the shoot, the
> hairpiece is studio property, only going home with the memento-seeking
> actor if he or she is a principal performer.
