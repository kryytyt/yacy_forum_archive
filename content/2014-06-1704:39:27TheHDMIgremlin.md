The HDMI gremlins are hungry
============================

![](http://www.jwz.org/images/pubtthou01.jpg)Today I discovered that all
of these devices have simultaneously bricked:

-   A 1x2 HDMI splitter;
-   An HDMI LCD monitor, and;
-   Every HDMI input (but not output) on my receiver.

That sounds unlikely, doesn\'t it? It does. It really does. But testing
against other devices seems to prove this to be true. It happened when I
had shut down my iMac to move some cables around, then turned it back
on.

I\'m guessing that the Mac\'s
[already-known-to-be-haunted](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/05/no-hdmi-for-me/)
video card decided to say *HEY GUYS HOW ARE YOU, NICE DAY FOR SOME
VOLTAGE ISN\'T IT?*

I already bought a new Mac. Now I get to buy a new everything else.
Hooray!
