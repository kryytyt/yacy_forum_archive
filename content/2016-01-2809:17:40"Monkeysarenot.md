[![](https://www.jwz.org/images/monkeys-typing.jpg)I was unaware of this

> Give an infinite number of monkeys an infinite number of typewriters,

> A group of faculty and students in the university\'s media program

> England, home to six Sulawesi crested macaques. Then, they waited.

> At first, said Phillips, \"the lead male got a stone and started

> Phillips, who runs the university\'s Institute of Digital Arts and

> Eventually, monkeys Elmo, Gum, Heather, Holly, Mistletoe and Rowan

> Later, the letters A, J, L and M crept in.
