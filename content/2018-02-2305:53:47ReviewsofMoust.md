======================================================

I tried to watch the remake of *Murder on the Orient Express*, and I
just couldn\'t get past the moustache:

I mean look at that thing! I spent twenty minutes having that
face-ferret pull me out of the movie: Is it real? Did he actually grow
that? Did he grow *part* of it and glue part on? Is it CGI? *Is it
Superman\'s Missing Moustache??* I couldn\'t pay any attention to the
movie: I was completely focused on that ridiculous growth. Eventually,
after about twenty minutes, I acclimated to it, and could move on to
more important things like the stunt-casting: \"Wait, was that Johnny
Depp? I think that was Johnny Depp but he wasn\'t playing Johnny
Depp\...\" And then they spring this shit on us:

He\'s sleeping in a [pink leather
face-corset](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2004/10/it-rubs-the-lotion-into-its-skin-or-else-it-gets-the-hose-again/)!
That has its own moustache! What the hell is this? So there goes the
next twenty minutes of the movie, wondering if this was actually A
Thing, trying to talk myself out of picking up my phone and googling
whether it was actually A Thing\...

Actually I think I only lasted another ten minutes before I gave up. The
plot was not nearly as loud as my internal dialogue.

(I did not google it.)
