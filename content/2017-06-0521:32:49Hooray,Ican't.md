Something has *again* gotten corrupted in the iPhone music database, so

Which is amazing design: \"Because I somehow think that *all* of the
music won\'t fit, I will sync *none* of it. You\'re welcome.\"

So I just want to nuke it from orbit and re-install from local backup,
and wait 5 hours for all the music to re-sync. But when I try to do
\"Restore iPhone\" I get:

is this? Apple thinks that sane people store their password vault
*inside their heads?*
