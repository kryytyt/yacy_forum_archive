NASA\'s High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager spacecraft \-- an international mission to explore the basic physics of particle acceleration and energy release in solar flares \-- has sustained substantial damage during vibration testing. Repairs to the spacecraft, known as HESSI, will likely delay its launch to no earlier than January 2001.
