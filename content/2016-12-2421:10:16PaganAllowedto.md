> Phelan Moonsong says he always wears his goat horns unless he\'s
> sleeping or bathing, and so it makes sense that he\'d want to wear
> them in his driver\'s license photo. How else is an officer, TSA
> employee, or other license checker supposed to recognize him? Plus,
> the horns serve as his \"spiritual antennae\" and help him educate
> others about paganism, according to Moonsong.

> He needed to educate the authorities in Maine a little bit before
> they\'d approve the license photo, but they finally did. He got his
> new license last week. \[\...\]
>
> The clerk also had some questions, like whether the horns were
> implanted (they aren\'t), and whether they were a religious symbol
> (they are). The clerk took the photo, but then said he\'d have to get
> it approved by the Maine Secretary of State\'s office, and would need
> to send some documentation of the fact that these are officially
> required religious symbols.
