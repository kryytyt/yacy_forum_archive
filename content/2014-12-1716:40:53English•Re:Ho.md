Okay, i think the problem can be provisional solved in File
\"[source/net/yacy/search/Switchboard.java](https://gitorious.org/yacy/rc1/source/6c3f36def1397a1235ea2b0432640fe21fff919f:source/net/yacy/search/Switchboard.java){.postlink}\":\
Change Lines 924 / 1443 from

Code: 
:   `Domains.setNoLocalCheck(isAllIPMode());`

to

Code: 
:   `Domains.setNoLocalCheck(isAllIPMode() | !(this.getConfigBool("isTransparentProxy",false)));`

I hope this will disable the Local-IP-Check if the internal Proxy is
disabled by the Peer-Configuration. That means that all incoming
Connections are always handled by the HTTP-Server because the Check is
completely avoided if the internal Proxy is disabled. This is variant 2
from [this
Post](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?t=5394#p31087){.postlink}.\

Your Peer is still reliable responding with a 403-Error for accesses
with the Link (i have sent you with a PM), i think there is a really
good chance for removing this problem.\

Okay, i think your suggestion is right, from a moderators point of
view.\
But one question is open: what could be the correct answer from a
developers point of view?\
I mean the answer for my (hard) criticism.\
