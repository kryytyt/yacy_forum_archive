> This one comes from months of careful reporting by two separate teams,
> one at the Pulitzer Prize-winning website [Inside Climate
> News](http://insideclimatenews.org/news/18092015/exxon-confirmed-global-warming-consensus-in-1982-with-in-house-climate-models),
> and the other at the [Los Angeles
> Times](http://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-arctic/) (with an assist from
> the Columbia Journalism School). Following separate lines of evidence
> and document trails, they\'ve reached the same bombshell conclusion:
> ExxonMobil, the world\'s largest and most powerful oil company, knew
> everything there was to know about climate change by the mid-1980s,
> and then spent the next few decades systematically funding climate
> denial and lying about the state of the science. \[\...\]
>
> A few observers, especially on the professionally jaded left, have
> treated the story as old news \-- as something that even if we didn\'t
> know, we knew. \"Of course they lied,\" someone told me. That
> cynicism, however, serves as the most effective kind of cover for
> Exxon (right alongside the tired argument that it\'s \"not the fault
> of the companies \-- they\'re just meeting demand from all of us\").
> What\'s beginning to sink in is the horrible impact of their lies:
> Exxon, had its leaders merely stated directly what they knew to be
> true, could have ended the pretend debate over climate change as early
> as the 1980s.
