========================================================

``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
update the older ResponseHeader patch to handle cookies,
to work directly with javax.servlet.http.Cookie (rename headerProps to
cookieStore as is only used for this).
(Re)implement set-cookie in DefaultServlet to make cookieAuthentication
work as designed.
```
