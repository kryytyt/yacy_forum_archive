Hi again.\
\
Last time I had the issue I solved it by installing a new node and
copied over the old index to that node, for some time it did work but 1
or 2 days ago the issue came back
![:(](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif "Sad")\
In retrospective it\'s a good thing that my node started acting up
again, now I had the chance to try your fix on a faulty node
![:mrgreen:](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif "Mr. Green")\
\
I updated the node from 9091 to 9150, deleted the queues dir and started
up again.\
\
I have only done a few test (Searching and using the node as a proxy)
but so far things seems to be working out like it should.
![:D](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif "Very Happy")\
I will try to stress the node with more searches and more proxy use than
normal in the next days to see if it holds up..\
