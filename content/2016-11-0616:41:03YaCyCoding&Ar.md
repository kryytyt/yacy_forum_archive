YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: Increase the priority of the \'Re-Crawl Index Documents\'

Thank you very much. I just applied custom values at this page and saved
the new values. But shortly after that the values got reset to their
default values. I\'m looking for something in the java code to change
the thread priority. At that time we migrated the build-in index to Solr
we had a procedure to migrate the old index to Solr. This procedure ran
at low priority in the background. I just changed a value of a variable
in the java code to take influence of the thread priority and then it
ran much faster. Is this also possible in context I described above? If
so, in which class should I made the change and whats the exact area of
the corresponding code?
