Daily Reminder fuer alle Drohnen:

> In industrialized countries, people belong to one institution or
> another at least until their twenties. After all those years you get
> used to the idea of belonging to a group of people who all get up in
> the morning, go to some set of buildings, and do things that they do
> not, ordinarily, enjoy doing. Belonging to such a group becomes part
> of your identity: name, age, role, institution.

Ihr seid brainwashed.
