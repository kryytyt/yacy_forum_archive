[Kurze Durchsage von Craig Murray zum
\"Russen-Hack\"](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/10/cia-concludes-russia-interfered-to-help-trump-win-election-report):

> Craig Murray, the former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan, who is a close
> associate of Assange, called the CIA claims "bullshit", adding: "They
> are absolutely making it up."
>
> "I know who leaked them," Murray said. "I've met the person who leaked
> them, and they are certainly not Russian and it's an insider. It's a
> leak, not a hack; the two are different things.

Und dann bringt er noch ein schÃ¶nes Argument:

> "America has not been shy about arresting whistleblowers and it's not
> been shy about extraditing hackers. They plainly have no knowledge
> whatsoever."
