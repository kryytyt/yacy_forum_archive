English â€¢ Security
==================

Date: 2015-02-04 16:57:06

I\'m looking YaCy security aspects.\
\
I have a question about intercommunication between yacy nodes. Is there
any IP list of all running YaCY nodes? or it\'s a hashed list?\
\
What I want to know if there\'s any way to ennumerate all YaCy nodes on
the network. Cause I would like to be annonymous\
\
Thanks!
