Fight Against Fake News Was Undercut by Fear of Conservative

> According to two sources with direct knowledge of the company\'s
> decision-making, Facebook executives conducted a wide-ranging review
> of products and policies earlier this year, with the goal of
> eliminating any appearance of political bias. One source said
> high-ranking officials were briefed on a planned News Feed update that
> would have identified fake or hoax news stories, but
> disproportionately impacted right-wing news sites by downgrading or
> removing that content from people\'s feeds. According to the source,
> the update was shelved and never released to the public. It\'s unclear
> if the update had other deficiencies that caused it to be scrubbed.
>
> \"They absolutely have the tools to shut down fake news,\" said the
> source, who asked to remain anonymous citing fear of retribution from
> the company. The source added, \"there was a lot of fear about
> upsetting conservatives after Trending Topics,\" and that \"a lot of
> product decisions got caught up in that.\"
>
> \"The strength of our community depends on authentic communication.\"

*\"The news would be true if you people would just play nice.\"*

> The feedback we\'ve gotten tells us that authentic stories are the
> ones that resonate most.

*\"Users tell us that things that they think are true make them
happy.\"*

> \"We rely heavily on the community to report content.\"

*\"We in the petrochemical industry rely heavily on the community to
report toxic spills.\"*

> In a Facebook post published after the election, former Facebook
> product designer Bobby Goodlatte blamed the social network for
> boosting the visibility of \"highly partisan, fact-light media,\" and
> for not taking bigger steps to combat the spread of fake news in the
> lead-up to the election. \"A bias towards truth isn\'t an impossible
> goal for News Feed,\" he wrote. \"But it\'s now clear that democracy
> suffers if our news feeds incentivize bullshit.\"

> I don\'t know how Facebook thinks \-- who could? But it might be

> For Mark Zuckerberg to say that less than 1% of news on Facebook is a

This is your irregularly-scheduled reminder:

If you work for Facebook, quit. It is morally indefensible for you to
use your skills to make that company more powerful. By working there,
you are making the world an objectively worse place. I\'m sure you can
find a job working for a company that you don\'t have to *apologize* for
all the time.

You can *do it.* I *believe* in you.
