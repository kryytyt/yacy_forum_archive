Display Index Browser links requiring auth only when authenticated.

In the /HostBrowser.html page "only hosts with urls pending in the
crawler", "only with load errors" and "Administration Options" all
require administration credentials. But they were displayed even to
unauthenticated users, and clicking them did nothing and returned the
/HostBrowser.html page empty.
