postfix and spamassassin
========================

Date: 2014-10-18 21:34:52

So I had been running spamassassin from postfix like this:

> `mailbox_command = /usr/bin/spamc                  --no-safe-fallback                  --max-size 100000000                  --connect-retries 5                  --retry-sleep 5                  --pipe-to /usr/libexec/dovecot/deliver                  || exit 75`{style="font-size:smaller"}

but it seems like maybe the proper way is:

> ` mailbox_command = /usr/libexec/dovecot/deliver smtpd_milters = unix:/var/run/spamass-milter/postfix/sock non_smtpd_milters = $smtpd_milters milter_default_action = accept`{style="font-size:smaller"}

however, the former runs the final recipient\'s
`$HOME/.spamassassin/user_prefs` and the latter does not. Is there some
way to make the latter do what the former does? Or is the former
actually the right way to do it?
