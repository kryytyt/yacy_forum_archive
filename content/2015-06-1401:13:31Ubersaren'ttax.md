[![](http://www.jwz.org/images/medallion.jpg)Now That Taxis Have A Small
Advantage On Market Street, Uber Wants To Be Treated Like
Them](http://sfist.com/2015/06/12/now_that_taxis_have_a_small_advanta.php)

> Usually insistent upon being considered a \"Transportation Network
> Company,\" which is to say a technology business and not some sort of
> retrograde taxi service, Uber \"Technologies\" has changed its tune
> this week at the appearance of a small advantage for taxi drivers.
> \[\...\]
>
> This August the SFMTA will restrict cars traveling between Eighth and
> Third streets from turning onto Market Street. All vehicles will still
> be able to move straight ahead and cross Market, and exceptions to the
> turning rule will be made for taxis, emergency vehicles, paratransit
> vehicles, and commercial vehicles such as delivery trucks. No
> exceptions will be made for Uber, Lyft, et al.
>
> \[\...\] the company wrote in an email to the public that grossly
> elides the facts of the new rules. For starters, the email is called
> \"Allow Uber On Market St.,\" which, okay, literally no one is saying
> Uber can\'t operate on Market. You just can\'t make turns like
> emergency vehicles or taxis, which, quick refresher, are a thing which
> you guys have desperately fought to not be.
