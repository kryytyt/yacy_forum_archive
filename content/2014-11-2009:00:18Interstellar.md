Wow, what a stinking log of Spielberg-flavored shit. I cringed less as
the science in 7 seasons of Stargate SG-1 than I did in this saccharine
turd. And that had less emo-exposition, too. And no precocious children.

This was like \-- Prometheus bad.

it was like an episode from the even-worse-than-you-expected 2018 season
of Dr. Who.
