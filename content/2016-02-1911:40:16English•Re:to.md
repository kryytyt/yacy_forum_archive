You\'re welcome!\

You can run this command on your Ubuntu instance before starting YaCy
and after starting any other application or service you usually need :
free -h\
Thus you will see how much memory is already used, how much is free and
if swap is eventually used. I think you can safely assign to YaCy JVM
the total amount of free memory, minus say some 100 or 200MB to be sure.
