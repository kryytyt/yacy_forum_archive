Noted mad scientist [Stephen Wolfram](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/)
(the Mathematica guy) applies his inimitable levels of
obsession-to-detail to writing a biography of Ada Lovelace. It\'s really
good:

> Ada Lovelace was born 200 years ago today. To some she is a great hero
> in the history of computing; to others an overestimated minor figure.
> I\'ve been curious for a long time what the real story is. And in
> preparation for her bicentennial, I decided to try to solve what for
> me has always been the \"mystery of Ada\".
>
> It was much harder than I expected. Historians disagree. The
> personalities in the story are hard to read. The technology is
> difficult to understand. The whole story is entwined with the customs
> of 19th-century British high society. And there\'s a surprising amount
> of misinformation and misinterpretation out there.
>
> But after quite a bit of research \-- including going to see many
> original documents \-- I feel like I\'ve finally gotten to know Ada
> Lovelace, and gotten a grasp on her story. In some ways it\'s an
> ennobling and inspiring story; in some ways it\'s frustrating and
> tragic.
