``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
added a markdown image generation servlet stub. This servlet can indeed
at this time not interprete markdown but it is able to print a given
text in a very tiny 5-pixel font into an image.
To use the servlet, you can i.e. call
http://localhost:9100/vis/markdown.png?text=hello%20world%0Dhello%20universe&color_text=000000&color_background=ffffff&padding=3
It is preferred that you use POST http requests to submit large texts.
```
