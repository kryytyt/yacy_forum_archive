The \'green\' car industry in China is recognized to have bright
prospects. In 2006, The car consumes to only 1.03 kg hydrogen for every
100 kilometres. As well as this has been possible due to 5 years of hard
work of China\'s car industry. As part of its 10th five-year plan, China
took the choice to put electric car research as well as development at
the top of its agenda. This took place in 2001. All aspects of electric
cars were given to special attention containing to manufacturing,
research, development of electric cars, as well as technology to drive
them.\
