Fragen und Antworten • search results seem to disappear
=======================================================

Hi!\
\
For testing purposes I\'ve started to crawl two sites. Advertisements in
two different topics.\
Crawling processes have started successfully but somewhat later I
discovered that results for one of the sites seem to fall back time to
time.\
Although there were tens of thousands of hits before, it reset back to a
few only. And this happens over and over again.\
There is no problem at all with the other site. The quantity of search
results just grows continuously for this one.\
\
Where should I check for the cause of this strange behavior?\
\
Thanks,
