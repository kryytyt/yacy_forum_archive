English â€¢ Too high memory usage
===============================

Date: 2014-06-25 05:30:17

Hi,\
\
My yacy peer is using too much memory while crawling, which is causing
the interface to hang sometimes (does not open at all). The free command
shows that around 10M of memory is free and this machine is dedicated
for yacy. The machine has 1GB of RAM.\
\
I have tried reducing the memory reserved for JVM from 600 to 300 but
there is no difference in memory usage reported by OS tools. Also, the
interface now shows \"RAM Max\" as 290 MB, so where is the rest of the
memory being used for?
