[**DNA Lounge update, wherein three national corporations control nearly
all of San Francisco\'s live
music.**](https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2018/01/31.html)

Slim\'s and Great American Music Hall recently
[announced](https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Goldenvoice-to-partner-with-Slims-great-american-12522236.php)
that they will be \"partnering\" with Golden Voice. That\'s a euphemism
for \"turning over most or all control of what events go on the
calendar\". Basically they are outsourcing booking to another company.
I\'m sure they have their reasons, but this makes me really sad.

I have no intention of picking on the Slim\'s team, whom I have the
utmost respect and sympathy for, but\...

I\'m here to tell you that monopolies are bad. They are bad for consumer
choice, they are bad for ticket pricing, they are bad for artists
getting paid, they are bad for your local music scene, and they are bad
for our culture as a whole.

To explain why, first let me start with some numbers. Here is who owns
what when it comes to live music in San Francisco:

1.  **[Live Nation
    Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Nation_Entertainment)**
    (\$9 billion)
    -   Owns TicketMaster (who sell 80% of all tickets in the US).
    -   Formerly a division of Clear Channel (who own essentially *all*
        US radio stations).
    -   Owns 117 venues, 75 in the US.
    -   Exclusively books 33 additional venues.
    -   Owns House of Blues (14 locations).
    -   Owns their own record label, Live Nation Artists.
    -   Books SF Masonic Auditorium (3,500 capacity).
    -   Owns The Fillmore (1,200 capacity).
2.  **[AEG: Anschutz Entertainment
    Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschutz_Entertainment_Group)**
    (\$8 billion)

    -   Largest owner of sports teams and events in the world.
    -   Second largest music promoter after Live Nation.
    -   Own *many* arenas worldwide.
    -   Owns AXS, a concert ticket vendor.
    -   Owns Coachella (600,000 attendance).
    -   Owns part of Bottle Rock (120,000 attendance).
    -   Runs around ten other large music festivals.
    -   Owned by a [Fundamentalist, homophobic, climate change
        denier](https://pitchfork.com/news/coachella-co-owners-latest-charitable-filing-shows-deep-anti-lgbtq-ties/).
    -   **[Golden Voice](http://www.goldenvoice.com/venues/), a division
        of AEG**

        -   Books Coachella (600,000 attendance).
        -   Books The Warfield (2,300 capacity).
        -   Books The Regency Center (1,400 capacity).
        -   Books Social Hall SF (600 capacity).
        -   Owns 12 other venues in LA.

        And now:

        -   Books Slim\'s (500 capacity).
        -   Books Great American Music Hall (600 capacity).

3.  **[APE: Another Planet
    Entertainment](http://apeconcerts.com/venues/)**

    -   Runs Outside Lands (200,000 attendance).
    -   Runs (ran?) Treasure Island Music Festival (30,000 attendance).
    -   Books The Greek Theatre (8,500 capacity).
    -   Books Bill Graham Civic Auditorium (8,500 capacity).
    -   Books Fox Theatre (2,900 capacity).
    -   Books The Independent *\[sic\]* (500 capacity, 21+).
    -   Is also an artist management business.

So that leaves us with the remaining independent live music venues in
San Francisco:

(I\'m sure I have accidentally omitted some venues, but I think I got
most of the SF venues that regularly host live music by touring acts.
I\'ve omitted venues that exclusively host DJ dance parties, because
that\'s a bit of a different business.)

Even omitting all of the massive music festivals, three \$17+ billion
dollar corporations control somewhere around 80% of all available
\"seats\" for live shows in SF and Oakland.

So what\'s the problem?

Let\'s start with a hypothetical.

Let\'s say you\'re an agent trying to book a tour for your band. You
decide how many days they want to be on the road, how many cities they
want to try and hit, and then you start sending out emails to find out
what dates are available so you can figure out the routing. Let\'s say
your first call is to some venue in New York, and the talent buyer there
says, \"As it happens, I also book venues in 15 other cities, so I can
put your whole tour on the calendar right now, how\'s that?\" What a
relief! So much less work! But then an independent operator in, oh,
let\'s say San Francisco gets in touch with you and says, \"I hear your
band is going out on tour soon! We love those guys and would like to bid
on the show.\" But then what happens? The corporate talent buyer says to
you, \"Look, I was giving you a great deal on these 15 dates, but if you
want to take your business to my competition instead of taking the full
package that I offered you, the price is going to go up. And also, maybe
some of those dates are no longer available for you.\"

So you write back to the small fry, who may have even offered you more
money for that particular date, and you say, \"Sorry, maybe next time.\"

Or, let\'s say you\'re an agent and you represent a band with a huge
draw, as well as a bunch of smaller bands. You\'re trying to get your
bigger band booked on the summer festival circuit, so you\'re trying to
pitch them as big up-and-comers to the agencies booking the festivals.
Maybe these guys have been playing 2,000 capacity rooms and you\'re
trying to get them their big break: a late afternoon set in front of a
captive audience of 10,000. So while that conversation is ongoing, you
are also trying to book a tour for a different, smaller band. You\'re
thinking of putting them in an independent venue who are offering you a
good deal, but the festival buyer also books dozens of smaller venues,
and you sure don\'t want to piss them off, because that could mean your
job. So instead, you go with the corporate-controlled smaller room as
well, regardless of its merits.

\"Well that\'s just business, that\'s just playing hard-ball.\" Sure.
It\'s also bad for art, and bad for local businesses. It consolidates
control and profit in whatever company controls the routing, even if
they don\'t live in your town. It homogenizes everything.

This is how you end up with venues in dozens of different cities who all
have the same calendar. This venue in Portland has the same lineup as
that venue in Seattle, just shifted by two days, and so on. Obviously a
venue\'s character is defined by more than just what\'s on the
calendar\... but the calendar is a *pretty big part.*

And those are only examples of how corporate consolidation is bad for
the booking side of things. Multi-venue booking agencies also tend to
own or have exclusivity deals with ticketing companies as well. Live
Nation owns TicketMaster. AEG owns AXS Ticketing and partners with
eBay\'s StubHub. You wanted to use a different ticketing service that
you think has better features, or fees, or marketing reach? Sorry, not
part of the package. So a monopoly or near monopoly in one industry,
booking, squashes competition in another industry, ticketing. That\'s
the very definition of antitrust.

And then there\'s Live Nation\'s cozy relationship with their former
owner, Clear Channel \-- who control the playlists of basically every
radio station, and also own most of the billboards.

Plus, much of the time these conglomerates also manage the bands
themselves: so in the examples above where the band\'s agent was talking
to a venue\'s talent buyer? Now they\'re the same person! And often that
company also has a financial stake in a record label. So the same
company:

-   Signs the band;
-   Manages the band;
-   Decides how much radio play the band gets;
-   Promotes the band\'s tour;
-   Owns the billboards in every city on the tour route;
-   Owns all of the venues on the tour route;
-   Sells all of the tickets, merchandise, and alcohol.

Good luck trying to compete against that kind of vertical integration.

Back in 2009, when Representative Bill Pascrell tried (and failed) to
block Live Nation from merging with TicketMaster, [he
said:](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/07/congressman-asks-justice-department-to-block-live-nationticketmaster-merger/)

> Under the proposed merger, the combined company would have control
> over nearly every aspect of the live music business: artist

> parking, ticket sales and resales, all the way down to the hot dogs

> \
> \"If the combination is permitted, \[the merged company\] will have a

> \
> The companies, if merged, would be over five times more powerful than

> The proposed merger would create a vertically integrated entity whose

> To avoid such problems, an entrant would need to enter the industry on

I\'m sure the Slim\'s and Great American Music Hall team had compelling
reasons for making the deal that they did. I assume it was a matter of
survival. Much like DNA Lounge, Slim\'s has never been a
self-sustainable business. They don\'t talk about it much, but it\'s not
exactly a secret. They only way that Slim\'s has been able to remain in
business for three decades is because of regular, large infusions of
cash from their patrons, [Boz
Scaggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boz_Scaggs) and [Warren
Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Hellman). Since Slim\'s
bought GAMH in 2000, the same has been true of GAMH as well.

Warren Hellman was a great and generous supporter of the arts in many
ways, but since he passed away in 2011, I assume the money tap has begun
to dry up. Or their expenses have increased and become untenable. I
don\'t know, I\'m guessing.

But you only sink decades of your life into a money-losing business if
it is a labor of love. I assure you, these folks haven\'t just been
sitting around looking for their big chance to cash out.

Some people, Libertarians and other Free Market absolutists, will look
at this and say, \"Well this means that independent live music venues
are not sustainable businesses in San Francisco, therefore it is right
and proper that they should go out of business or be sold off for
parts.\" That\'s like saying, \"Well I guess you just don\'t deserve to
live in San Francisco unless you earn over \$150,000 per year: have you
tried just *not* being poor?\"

Diverse and extensive entertainment options are a huge part of what
makes San Francisco what it is. Or was. Without that, we\'re just
another bedroom community for Mountain View.

I understand that the Slim\'s crew are soon moving out of their offices
in the Slim\'s building on Eleventh Street, and consolidating into the
offices inside GAMH. I assume that they need less space \-- and fewer
employees \-- now that they are no longer booking their own calendar.

Faustian bargain some day \-- and believe me, we\'ve discussed it \--
