Hello eros, did you keep a copy of the full log file containing the
\"(Too many open files)\" error? If you would like to share it it may be
helpful for a deeper analysis of the issue.\
\
Indeed I have run again some tests with large crawl queues (around
100000 to 220000 files in the QUEUES folder), on a Debian Jessie with
its file-max system setting value default set at 404027. But until now,
after many stops and restarts of YaCy, including change of the memory
settings, I did not reproduce the error you had.\
\
I was running with at max 2GB RAM memory dedicated to YaCy on a domestic
DSL connection, so not really in the same conditions as you. But if you
wish, I am still interested to have a look at your full log trace before
the error to find some clue about what was going wrong.
