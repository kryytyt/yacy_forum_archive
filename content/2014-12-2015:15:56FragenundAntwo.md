canyouseeme.org opens the TCP-Port but does not transfer any data, that
means it does not check for the availability of any kind of service.\

YaCy is a HTTP-Server, you can try
[webpagetest.org](http://www.webpagetest.org/){.postlink} with your
IP-Address + Port + / for a analysis of the HTTP-Response from your
Peer. (see on the Tap \"Details\" in the Result-Page)\

That is true, sorry. The tool on this Server is coded by me and i know
there is no correct Error-Handling between the Layers in my Software.
There are many reasons that can cause the response \"No valid YaCy-Peer
found\". It can be a problem on the HTTP-Layer (e.g. a HTTP-403-Error),
or the received data is not correct or empty, or something else is
wrong. You may receive the most precise answer if you send me your
IP-Address + Port as a private message and i will use my tool on my
local PC with a network-analyzer running in background.\
