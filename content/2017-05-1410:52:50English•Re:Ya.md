For sure it is very annoying to loose your work. At least if this would
happen again, you should try keeping or backing up your
/freeworld/SEGMENTS/ folder which holds the data you already indexed in
your local Solr and RWI indexes.\
\
The main parameter to control the end of a crawl is the \"Crawling
depth\", i.e. the number of links followed in the webgraph starting from
your crawl starting point. So if you set a too high value (over 8
according to Yacy help), it is likely you are indeed trying to crawl the
whole Internet, and you should certainly stop it manually after some
time.
