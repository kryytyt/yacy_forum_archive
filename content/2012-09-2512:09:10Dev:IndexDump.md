To create a high availability of search peers it is necessary to
transport a search index from one \'main\' peer to another \'backup\'
peer which will become the production server for search while the main
server undergoes maintenance.\
\
There is an easy way to create index dumps from the web interface:\
\
\* in /IndexControlURLs\_p.html: push \'Create Dump\', this produces a
zip from the index and shows the file path to this dump\
\* in /IndexControlURLs\_p.html: push \'Restore Dump\', this reads a
dump.\
\
Both can be done during operation. The storage of new index data is
blocked while the index dump or restore funktion is called. The same
operation can be done using a shell script within the bin-folder of the
YaCy release:\
\
\<path-to-yacy\>/bin/indexdump.sh\
.. creates the solr dump and prints out the file path to the dump.\
\
\<path-to-yacy\>/bin/indexrestore.sh \<dumpfile\>\
.. reads in the dump\
\
Therefore it is very easy to transport the search index from one peer
(1) to another peer (2) with one single command line:\
\<path-to-yacy2\>/bin/indexrestore.sh
\`\<path-to-yacy1\>/bin/indexdump.sh\`\
Both peers must be on the same machine within the same file system.
