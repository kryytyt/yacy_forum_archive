English â€¢ Re: Problem with the crawler
======================================

Ok, the error message is rather generic. It guess it could be an issue
with your hardware network connection (but likely not as your crawl is
working fine with other websites), or eventually this particular host
could be rejecting requests from your YaCy peer for some reason.\
Does this website answers without error when you request it from the
same computer on which you run YaCy, but with other tools such as a
browser, curl, wget\...?
