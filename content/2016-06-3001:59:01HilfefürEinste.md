Hilfe für Einsteiger und Anwender • Robinson Mode

Hello Yacy forums,\
I think this is a Robinson Mode issue I am struggling with.\
\
We have installed Yacy on a Windows 7 box.\
We are trying to index documents stored locally,\
at:\
\\users\\username\\YaCy\\DATA\\HTDOCS\\repository\\\
based on the guidance found at the Yacy-Websearch DOT
NET/wiki/index.php/En:Use\_cases for Collaborative Desktop Indexing\
\
Although documents get indexed (they show up in search), when we try to
click on the individual results, nothing happens.\
Therefore we cannot actually read the document.\
\
It looks like on the server I can copy/paste the URL and paste it in a
new tab and documents open up.\
However, just clicking the link does not do anything.\
\
Also, when accessing the search results from any other machine, the URL
string reads like this:\
file:///C:/users/rashid/YaCy/DATA/HTDOCS/repository/Topics/Cyber/Cyber%20Infrastructure%20No%20Borders.pdf\
\
So obviously clicking that URL from the non-server will always fail.\
\
Any advice?\
\
