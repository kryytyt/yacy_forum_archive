Thank you.\
Conditions seem to have changed with the upgrades to YaCy; thanks.\
Both machines have been upgraded to 1.81/9177 & latest Ubuntu\
\
The slow machine is now showing

> <div>
>
> \
> HTTP ERROR: 403\
> \
> Problem accessing /Status.html. Reason:\
> \
> proxy use not allowed (see Advanced Settings -\> HTTP Networking -\>
> Transparent Proxy; switched off).\
> Powered by Jetty://\
>
> </div>

\
\
Please advise the manual work around to fix this. i.e., what file to
adjust manually.\
\
We feel there may be more than 1 step required to restore system
visibility in the web admin and online\
Thanks very kindly\
\
The faster machine which does display results but does not process RSS
instructions shows a very curious address:\

> <div>
>
> \
> Address\
> Host: \[\]:8090\
> peer address not assigned\
> Proxy\
> Transparent off URL off\
> Remote: not used\
>
> </div>

\
\
It also shows\

> <div>
>
> \
> The peer must go online to get a peer address.\
>
> </div>

\
We note that both the machines displayed this and neither crawled
despite many RSS feeds programmed. Also manual crawl instructions were
not processed.\
There are no firewall changes in the clouds.\
\
Thank you again for your help!
