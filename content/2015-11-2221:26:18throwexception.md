``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
throw exception if crawler hostqueue can't create hostpath directory.
In rare cases hostname may not be a valid filesystem directory name,
which can't be created (e.g. containing '*' char). To prevent crawl queue
looping on this invalid entry by throwing a malformedurlexception.
