Mitmachen â€¢ YaCy funding and development policy
===============================================

Date: 2015-12-13 21:53:25

Hi everyone,\
I\'ve been using YaCy for some months now, and contributed as far as I
could in my free time. I really enjoy having this alternative as a
search engine, and to my mind it is really important to keep it alive
and make as simple to use as possible.\
Looking deep inside the code, I have seen it is already a big piece of
work!\
So I was wondering about current development and funding model\... Is it
currently only the work of volunteers? Do some people get rewarded for
their work on YaCy?\
I guess Orbiter or other developers get involved full time on YaCy at
some times (but not now?)\... To my mind, there is much to do to improve
reliability, performance, ease of use and installations for new
comers\... So there is already enough work for full time developers not
to wait an eventual YaCy2 architecture. Is it planned to launch funding
campaigns? What do you think about crowdfunding? Has it already been
used to fund YaCy?\
I am an experienced Java/J2EE developer and would find it great to have
the opportunity to work full time on YaCy, at least for some months. But
it requires some time and some funding. Does YaCy team would support an
individual crowdfunding campaign?\
That\'s all for my questions\...

I posted here in English because it seems to be the most appropriate
place in the forum\... and my German is too poor.\
Thanks for any feedback.
