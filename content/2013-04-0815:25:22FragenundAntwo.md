I don\'t see that this is related to YaCy. YaCy can run in any place of
the file system and especially chroot-ing would not be harmfull because
running YaCy just there where you decompress it is the default. The only
place where YaCy stores its data is the DATA subdirectory inside YaCy.
All other configurations (debian, MacOS X) where the DATA directory has
to be at a different place (deb package: /var/lib/yacy and MacOS X:
\~/Library/YaCy) use a symbolic link for that.\
\
Segmentation Faults happen in programs (such as the JVM) due to memory
errors. I guess that is not related to chroot.
