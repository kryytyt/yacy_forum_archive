Nature finds a way.

![](https://www.jwz.org/images/img_3436-thumb.jpg)I saw a girl get out
her 12oz tube of sunscreen and take a shot from it. Those tubes don\'t
unscrew, so it must have been tricky getting the leftover sunscreen out
before putting the alcohol in. On the other hand, if you filled it with
Malibu, would you be able to tell? Hey, maybe the recipe for Malibu is
vodka \"cask aged\" in sunscreen bottles.

Nothing will beat the time a couple years ago, though, when these guys
were passing around several boxed-wine bags - the big 2L or 3L ones. I
asked them how they managed to smuggle those in and they said, easy: we
just came to the park a couple days before they put up the fences, and
buried them in the woods!

Drunkenness favors the prepared.
