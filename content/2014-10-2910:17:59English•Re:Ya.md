You would need to unpack a previous release to get back a version but I
do not have the experience to tell you how.\

Could you download the log files and report it here
<http://mantis.tokeek.de/my_view_page.php>.\

Thanks for the tip I wont update mine yet unless I have a full recent
Backup.\

If /CrawlProfileEditor\_p.html still works then save page as TXT file to
backup all your crawling stuff incase there is no return.
