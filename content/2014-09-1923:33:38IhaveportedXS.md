Well, kinda. I made them all able to record MP4s of themselves, then
uploaded a two minute HD clip of each. That\'s a lot of videos! The
[XScreenSaver](http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/)
[screenshots](http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/screenshots/) page links
to the videos, and there\'s [a
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmpsDx9MuUM&list=PLbe67PprBSpqM_-HU49fmIS8ncApw4i08).
