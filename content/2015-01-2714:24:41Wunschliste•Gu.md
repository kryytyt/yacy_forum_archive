CASE.]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
We need to maximize our sources and Open Search engines are an important
meta tool for us.\
\
We recognize that this will increase the size of the results being
stored considerably.\
We want this, please.\
[[How do we turn off the filter that decides to include Opensearch
results ONLY if there are fewer than 20 results to display on a results
page?]{style="font-style: italic"}]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
\
Clearly there is [a filter that only adds Opensearch results if needed
in the classic YaCy usage when the crawler sees it has insufficient
results to fill the page]{style="text-decoration: underline"} -
described here:

> <div>
>
> \
> until enough results to fill the current search page\
>
> </div>

\
\
\>\>\> While 20 Results from each Opensearch source is a good number for
starting (ON or Off) for guaranteed inclusion,\
\>\>\> \>\>\> [[we need to have the option to index unlimited results
from each Opensearch source, please, and to be able to be load, parse
and index the results automatically (from all selected Opeansearch
background sources) each time a search is made for a specific search
word or specific search
string.]{style="text-decoration: underline"}]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
\
We believe that this should be pretty easy to do. It will lead to
increased usability for professional big data usage of YaCy.\
\
[[Thank you for making this possible as an option that we and probably
some others -with tightly focussed searches- really
need]{style="font-style: italic"}]{style="font-weight: bold"}.
