``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
make a YearNavigator availabel, useable as SearchEvent.naviator plugin.
It can take any Date field of the index and displays a list of year strings
in reverse order by the year (not the score/count).
To allow to define the index field to use, the fieldname (and title can be 
appended to the navi's name "year" e.g. year:load_date_dt:LoadDate
It works also with dates_in_content_dts field (from the graphical date
navigator). Here the query parameter from: to: are used on selection as
Query modifier (for other dates currently no query parameter available, so
selection won't work to filter search results).
Not included in the UI Searchpage layout config so far (for experiment with
it manual change to conf needed).
