Not a direct answer to the last comments, but a general observation:\
\
At least when run with OpenJDK, memory management seems to work better
with v7 than with v6 (of OpenJDK).\
\
On my old VPS, I had come to the limit where the database had grown so
large that yacy wouldn\'t even start. As I had already planned to move
to a larger VPS, I just stopped my node for a while. Shortly before I
actually moved to the new VPS, I realized that I had still openjdk6
installed and moved to openjdk7.\
\
With v7, yacy [did]{style="font-style: italic"} start without problems.
I didn\'t test if it lasted long at that time, but it was an unexpected
improvement just by moving to the newer openjdk.\
\
On my new VPS, I can now dedicate \~7 GB of RAM to yacy alone, so
everything is working like a charm, of course.
