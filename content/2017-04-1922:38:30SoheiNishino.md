I saw these [in
person](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/new-work-sohei-nishino/) a
little while ago and they are amazing: they are *huge* and the level of
detail is just ridiculous:

> After researching his chosen city, Nishino spends up to two months
> walking and photographing the urban environment, capturing thousands
> of images of streets, alleys, corners, and vistas from every
> imaginable angle. He then prints his contact sheets, cuts out the
> individual frames, and affixes them by hand onto board, in the process
> creating a large-scale, collaged map that expresses a truly personal
> interpretation of the featured location. Once the collages are
> complete, Nishino digitally photographs and presents them as high
> resolution, large-scale prints, often as big as 6 x 7 feet.
