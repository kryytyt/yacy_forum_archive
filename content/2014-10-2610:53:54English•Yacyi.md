A few months ago I found a useful tool to extract the links from a
google search then transfer to the yacy crawler, it was rather useful to
obtain my video links of all my videos on youtube.\
For youtube search of yourusername site:youtube.com. You will need a
spread sheet reader to view the links because its output to a CSV file.\
\
The Tool can be downloaded at <http://moz.com/tools/seo-toolbar> and is
free. I only advise using Firefox because its easier to turned off.\
When you install it requires a restart of Firefox. Also when you disable
it as well.\
\
Perform your desired search in google then on the top right-hand side
there is options button go to search settings then set Never show
instant results then increase the results per page to 100 then save.\
\
When you do a search now there is a menu up the top of the search page
you must wait until the tool (Moz-Bar) converts the results then you can
Export them to CSV, you will also see each result has a grey box with
some info but thats only for the Pro/paid version.\
Once the CSV file is saved you can open and copy all the second column
(the link info) and put the into Yacy\'s Advanced crawler. Note if the
list is shorter than 100 results you have not waited long enough for it
to work.\
I would only do 100 URLs at time so not to exceed the limits that might
be on the site you are crawling.\
\
Hope that helps.
