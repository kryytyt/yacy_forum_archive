> It is a perfect device, compatible with all known theories of humor

> Potato salad satisfies these and all other doomed attempts to

> humor-shaped and perfectly optimized. If it was ever whimsical it
> isn\'t anymore \-- there is too much money, too much potential, tied
> up with this salad. But this foundation of whimsy has created
> circumstances in which more capital is equated with more humor, which
> is too horrible an idea to even joke about: It is a transcendence that
> is out of our control, a villain, an invader, an awakening of The Old
> Ones, a Dire Event, or at least a Portent. What\'s funnier than
> \$37,115 for potato salad? \$47,115 for potato salad, ha ha. What\'s
> funnier than \$47,115? \$100,000. With every new dollar it feels more
> urgent to a viewer that he attach his name and his dollars to the
> thing, which is now obscured entirely by noise \-- a fee for ensuring
> that you\'re in on the joke.

> It\'s an investment compulsion, and the investment is a scam. (It\'s
> fun to imagine all business opportunities as jokes: They are temporary
> and dependent entirely on context; they are taken advantage of at the
> expense of someone or something that is often neither aware nor
> present; they are \-- necessarily? \-- cruel; they inspire the same
> embarrassing urge for inclusion, and the same shameful regret upon
> misapprehension or exclusion. Jokes! Look around you: Isn\'t it nice,
> that it\'s all just jokes?). If the campaign keeps going, some people
> may start to claim that, at some specific level of investment, the
> joke is no longer funny. It will be too much \-- the money could be
> better used on another campaign, or in another context entirely. This
> will be true but it will have always been true. None of these people
> will be able to explain to you what exactly changed.

> This is when it will begin to feel obvious, after Kickstarter takes
> its five percent, after Amazon banks its cut, when all at once the
> internet feels an opposite, equally irresistible urge to pretend that
> none of this ever happened, that we realize what the joke really was,
> and at whose expense it was told.
