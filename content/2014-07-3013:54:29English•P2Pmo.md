English â€¢ P2P mode, dht exchange
================================

Date: 2014-07-30 13:54:29

I\'d like to build own yacy private network. How to do it I know.\
\
Question is how many host with external IP should I have to activate p2p
data exchange between them. As I remember ages ago there was minimum
limit about 30+ hosts\
\
I am asking (before buy servers) cause I\'d like to have 3 or 4 machines
with Yacy installed and no data exchange between machines will be
problem for me\
\
If this limit still exist can you tell me where can I change it?
