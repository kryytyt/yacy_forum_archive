Sounds also quite interesting to me.\
\
Unfortunately, to my mind current YaCy is not ready to do what you
describe. In Search Portal mode or PeerToPeer mode (see
/ConfigBasic.html), localhost URL are not allowed to be crawled or
shared, as they are not supposed to be reachable by external network. I
tried crawling a zeronet site (ZeroTalk with images) but YaCy gives me
this message : Crawling of
\"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1C2JhCunGLtvyX56nQ88tcb87WnXspjWN\" failed.
Reason: denied\_(the host \'127.0.0.1\' is local, but local addresses
are not accepted: 127.0.0.1)/\
What you can do is at least to try crawling ZeroNet pages in YaCy
Intranet mode. It worked for me, but for some reason looks like not very
efficient, as links are not followed or indexed : at the end I got only
one page indexed with no much meta data (see /ViewFile.html).\
Try yourself, maybe you may have more success in this mode.\
\
By the way, maybe it would not require so much work to get YaCy working
with ZeroNet, but I believe some thinking and refactoring is needed.
