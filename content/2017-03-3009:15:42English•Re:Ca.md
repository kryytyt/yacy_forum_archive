Hi Giorgos,\
\
Web Cache and Index are two different things :\
- /var/lib/yacy/HTCACHE/ : the web cache that stores data downloaded by
the crawler, for faster next crawls, as would do a browser cache.\
- /var/lib/yacy/INDEX/ : this is the file storage for your local Solr
Index and YaCy internal Reverse Word Index. These are the main data,
used for searching. You should not delete manually files here, but if
you are running out of space, some administration pages can help you :\
- in \"Index Administration\" \> \"Index Deletion\"
(/IndexDeletion\_p.html) you will find various options and criteria to
clean your Solr Index (related folder is
/var/lib/yacy/INDEX/freeworld/SEGMENTS/solr\_5\_5)\
- in \"Index Administration\" \> \"Reverse Word Index\"
(/IndexControlRWIs\_p.html) you can for example limit the number of
references per word (related folder is
/var/lib/yacy/INDEX/freeworld/SEGMENTS/default)\
- more radically : in \"Index Administration\" \> \"URL Database
Administration\" (/IndexControlURLs\_p.html) in the \"Cleanup\" section
you can delete completely your Solr Index and/or RWI Index\
\
Complementary notes :\
- if you are regularly running out of space you can schedule these tasks
using the Process Scheduler (/Table\_API\_p.html)\
- wait a little or restart your peer to see changes on your disk usage
as Solr can take some time before completing its deletion task\
\
Have a nice day
