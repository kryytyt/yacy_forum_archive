[Let\'s \#BuyTwitter and
\#BanTrump:](https://www.gofundme.com/buytwitter)

> Donald Trump has done a lot of horrible things on Twitter. From
> emboldening white supremacists to promoting violence against
> journalists, his tweets damage the country and put people in harm\'s
> way. But threatening actual nuclear war with North Korea takes it to a
> dangerous new level.
>
> It\'s time to shut him down. The bad news is Twitter has ignored
> growing calls to enforce their own community standards and delete
> Trump\'s account. The good news is we can make that decision for them.

> Proceeds from this campaign will be used to buy a controlling share of
> Twitter. If we can\'t get a majority interest, we\'ll explore options
> for buying a significant stake in the company and champion this
> proposal at the annual shareholder meeting. If that\'s impossible for
> any reason or if there is a surplus from this campaign, 100% of the
> balance of proceeds will be donated to Global Zero, a nonprofit
> organization leading the resistance to nuclear war.
