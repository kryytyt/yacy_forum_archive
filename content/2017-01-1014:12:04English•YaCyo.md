English â€¢ YaCy on the Raspberry Pi
==================================

Date: 2017-01-10 14:12:04

I found these instructions on the Wiki:\
\
[http://www.yacy-websearch.net/wiki/inde \...
spberry\_Pi](http://www.yacy-websearch.net/wiki/index.php/En:Raspberry_Pi){.postlink}\
\
but there is already a Debian-based distro that comes with an optimised
setup so you don\'t have to remove a lot of crap before you get cracking
with your search portal!\
\
DietPi: <http://dietpi.com/>\
\
I\'m about to try YaCy on a Pi3 (wish me luck!) using this excellent
distro and if would be great if a few more of you are able to join me.
DietPi already handles a bunch of stuff for me including my entire music
and video library, radio, advert blocking (PiHole) and a bunch of other
stuff. Decentralised search is more important than ever before and if we
can get a few more people to join us with the Pi (and if it works) we
can potentially build an open appliance to take the web back from the
Google cancer.\
\
EDIT: Well it worked (using the Debian installer - the instructions on
the Wiki are way out of date). Predictably perhaps, bloody Java sent the
poor little quad-core ARM7 spinning up so hard it hit 67C before I
chickened out and hit the brakes. I\'ve ordered some coolers so I can
give it another go though. All that said, it seemed to work rather well,
but I won\'t know for sure until it\'s been running for at least 24
hours without a hitch.\
\
I wish someone would convert it to a better language like RUST, C or
C++. I\'ve never really understood why people think Java is suitable for
these tasks: portable it may be, but efficient it aint!
