Hello shni,\
sorry to answer in English, but I hope this can still be useful. With
your example I identified four issues, and could fix three of them :\
- bad HTML rendering of \'+\' characters when there is a \'?\' before :
[fixed](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commit/4564541b3b3b1f525a2fe741bca952f8fa2916be){.postlink}\
- wrongly added \".\*.\*/.\*\" because expecting at least one wildcard
\'\*\' chararacter without considering \'?\' and \'+\' chars which are
also wildcards :
[fixed](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commit/58d23047ddeb9e0ee2aa0bc31ad4692220706cfc){.postlink}\
- bad identification of the URL protocol part when the regex starts with
\'\^\' or when the protocol part contains a \'?\' :
[fixed](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commit/522a268305208d71a2f5b9d3652694fe75b4c2d5){.postlink}
(note : by the way, the protocol is then ignored by the BlackList engine
which only consider the domains names and paths)\
- bad identification of the host (domain name) part when it contains the
slash \'/\' character in a characters class (\"\[\^\\./\]\" in your
example) : not fixed. Internally YaCy Blacklist engine splits the
blacklist entries between host and path parts, relying on the first
\'/\' character to identify the end of the host part. So your example
should be modified only a little bit to keep working : from
\"\^https?://(www\\.)?\[\^\\.\]+\\.\[\^\\./\]+(/\[\^/\]){0,2}/?\$\" to
\"(www\\.)?\[\^\\.\]+\\.\[\^\\.\]+/(\[\^/\]){0,2}/?\$\"\
\
The fixes are now available in the latest sources on GitHub. If you have
some time to test and still encounter issues don\'t hesitate to report!
