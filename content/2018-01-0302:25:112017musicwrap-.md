In only approximate order of favoriteness \-- and for the *fifteenth*
year in a row \-- here is my year-end wrap-up. As usual, a few of the
entries on the following list were released earlier than 2017, but that
is when I discovered them, so I\'m allowing some slack. Though most were
actually released in 2017.

This year I acquired roughly 88 new releases: about half were from 2017,
a quarter were from 2015 or 2016, and the rest older. That\'s about the
same number of releases as [last
year](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2017/01/2016-music-wrap-up-and-mixtape-177/),
but far less new stuff; and it\'s about half of the
[2012](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2012/12/2012-music-wrap-up-and-mixtape-124/)
numbers. Also I notice that almost half of these are by bands I have
been familiar with for years, which reflects quite a slump in discovery.
Though I\'ve been able to compile the
[mixtapes](https://www.dnalounge.com/webcast/mixtapes/) at about the
same rate. I also feel like I saw a *lot* fewer live shows this year,
though I haven\'t run the numbers on that.

Number of those bands that I saw perform this year: 8.\
Number of those bands that performed at DNA Lounge this year: 6.\
Both of those numbers are quite terrible.

As is becoming an unfortunate habit, I would feel better about myself if
I had written a glowing paragraph about each of these excellent
albums\... but I haven\'t. Sorry.
