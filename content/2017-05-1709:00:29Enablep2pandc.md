Enable p2p and cluster communication when "Protection of all pages" on

As reported by paul89 on YaCy forum
(http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5958 ), when setting
the "Protection of all pages" to "On" in the "ConfigAccounts_p.html"
page, the peer became completely unreachable by others, which is not the
purpose of this feature.
But the restriction still makes sense as a security enforcement and is
maintained in private "Robinson mode" where by the way any peer-to-peer
or cluster communication would be rejected.
