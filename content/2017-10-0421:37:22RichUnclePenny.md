> A person dressed in a black top hat and bushy white mustache,
> occasionally putting on a monocle or dabbing forehead sweat with giant
> paper money, sat in the audience of the Senate Banking Committee
> hearing on the Equifax data breach on Wednesday. Former Equifax CEO
> Richard Smith didn\'t seem to notice. \[\...\]
>
> The protester was [Amanda Werner](https://twitter.com/wamandajd) of
> Americans for Financial Reform and Public Citizen, who also handed out
> Monopoly-style [\"Get out of jail free\"
> cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfRsXN8kUX0). The Senate
> leadership has been pushing to rollback a rule issued by the Consumer
> Financial Protection Bureau in July that would curtail the use of
> arbitration clauses. The House has already voted to kill the rule.
>
> \"Arbitration is a rigged game,\" Werner said in an emailed statement
> from her office. \"Bank lobbyists and their allies in Congress are
> trying to overturn the CFPB\'s rule so they can continue to rip off
> consumers with impunity.\"
>
> She also showed up in the costume outside the same hearing room
> Tuesday, when the banking committee was updated about last year\'s
> fake accounts scandal at Wells Fargo.
