===========================================================

Hi,\
i currently have 6 servers, cheap vps\'s, kimsufi dedi + hezner dedi.\
\
My questions are related to crawling and solr index / performance.\
\
1) When Solr index grows over time, lets say to \>100gb. Is the
performance for search queries affected by RAM or IOPS? And how to
improve index speed if its affected?\
2) Is it better to run small peers with small indexes vs one peer with
enormous index (over 100GB)?\
\
Id like to contribute to yacy network as much as possible but i have to
plan using my resources for best QPH / PPM for the network, so advices
would be nice.\
\
Br,\
