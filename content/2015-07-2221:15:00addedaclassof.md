``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
added a class of different content filters including keywords which are
used to identify messages to do a training of a bayesian filter.
Messages will now get document categorization about `language`,
`profanity` and `emotion`. All new arriving messages are used to train
the forgetful bayesian filter.
An extension for the search constraints was implemented. You can now use
the constratints /emotion, /profanity and /language to filter messages
for content that belong to those categories. All constraints can also be
applied in a negative way.
This can now be used to filter out profanity content by using the
constraint `-/profanity`.
