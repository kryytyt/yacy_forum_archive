because these design templates are just wireframes without any usage of
the YaCy css framework (we have skins) someone would need to create a
whole new infrastructure of servlets. Thats something someone needs to
do as a coding work. Because this is a \'lets do everything different
attempt\' it will most likely never happen. This needs HUGE work.\
\
but.. a big change like this already happened to YaCy in the past where
the current interface with a css-based skin framework was created. See
also:\
<http://www.yacy-websuche.de/wiki/index.php/De:Skins>\
\
If a designer would just care about the css and new icons, things would
be easy. Do the following:\
- copy a \<yacy-root\>/skins/\<skin\>.css file and make your changes\
- submit it to your clone of yacy\
\
don\'t wait until \'someone else should do that\'-event happens. Just do
it yourself!
