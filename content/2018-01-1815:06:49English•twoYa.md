English â€¢ two YaCy ?
====================

Date: 2018-01-18 15:06:49

Hi all,\
\
How to install two (or more) YaCy in the same in system, completely
independant & own parameyers, users (\...) and accessible independently\
\... but on same machine with only one IP\
\...\
\
(this is to fill 2 complete different needs: 1 public to share the
search/participate over the Yacy network + public portal, & the other
one for private documents and stats)\
Please detailed instructions for the port & IP aspects, as I am far from
an admin guru\
\
Thanks,\
Fabrice
