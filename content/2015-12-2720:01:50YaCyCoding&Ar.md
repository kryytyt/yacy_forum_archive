YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: Using WARC as import option & YaCy2 architecture
=================================================================================

Date: 2015-12-27 20:01:50

I worked with a commercial partner who selected YaCy over Nutch as
crawler because they considered Nutch as old and badly maintained
already some years ago. Since then I worked with these partners to
enhance the YaCy crawler even further. Because of this experience,
turning to Nutch would be a huge step back.\
\
Apache Tika is a component for Solr which bundles a set of parsers and
unifies their metadata structure into a common metadata structure. The
same does YaCy and YaCy uses a superset of parsers which are in Tika.
Furthermore, the metadata structure in YaCy is much much richer than
that which is used in Tika. That means: Tika is great, but already
subsumed with the functions in YaCy.\
\
What is great about Nutch and Tika is the \'thinking in modules\'. Thats
exactly what the idea with the YaCy2 components is.\

WARC is a great format and there are already a lot of tools for it, so
it\'s just a good choice. This is not about \'selling\' data. The word
\'distribution\' considers the usability for the (YaCy!) community.\

That as well!
