English â€¢ dht, internal ip
==========================

Date: 2017-07-10 09:20:17

I\'d like to run cluster inside lan and my questions are:\
\
- how many mashines should I run to fully use p2p between mashines in my
cluster?\
- may I use internal IP (internal search engine for corpo) or only
external are accepted\
\
I am asking becouse ages ago I heared that I must have external IP and
over 20 mashines in cluster (now I can\'t find this on forum)
