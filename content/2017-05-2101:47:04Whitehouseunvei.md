[Disney\'s Hall of Presidents show reportedly rolled back so Trumpbot
won\'t get a speaking
role:](https://boingboing.net/2017/05/19/international-hall-of-presiden.html)

> For decades, new US presidents were welcomed to Walt Disney World\'s
> Hall of Presidents with a robot carved in their honor, and which would
> deliver a short, recorded speech voiced by the incoming POTUS himself
> \-- but the idea of a talking Trumpbot is so repugnant that the entire
> show is reportedly being rolled back to an earlier version (nominally
> to shorten it), eliminating the speaking roles of everyone except
> Lincolnbot and Washingtonbot.
>
> Disney World castmembers have long used the Hall of Presidents as a
> locus for pranks (putting Nixonbot in handcuffs, slipping a condom
> into the breast-pocket of Clintonbot), but the likely fallout of a
> divisive, white supremacist con-artist delivering canned lines every
> 20 minutes for four years (or less?) was apparently too much for the
> parks
