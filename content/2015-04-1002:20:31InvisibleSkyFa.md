> Church leaders successfully persuaded California Pacific Medical
> Center to delay a weekend traffic closure on Van Ness Avenue so a
> temporary ban on street parking would not coincide with Easter
> weekend. \[\...\] The detour, one in a series of lane closures on Van
> Ness, was originally supposed to happen last weekend. Now that it\'s
> been postponed, the two full traffic closures will coincide with the
> annual Cherry Blossom Festival and parade, which runs north on Polk
> Street, then west on Post Street. \[\...\]

> \"If this street closure is allowed to occur it will force the SFIC
> and its constituent congregations and judicatories to respond to the
> City and the SFMTA with a unified message of condemnation,\" SF
> Interfaith Council Executive Director Michael Pappas wrote in a March
> 11 email to SFMTA Director Ed Reiskin. \"I am appealing to you to
> intercede before this matter becomes irreversible.\" \[\...\]

> This wouldn\'t be the first time the SFMTA has conceded to church
