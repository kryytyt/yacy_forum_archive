What year is it that this kind of dialog is considered even remotely
acceptable? Are they *actually joking?*

And has there *ever* been a time when quitting iTunes didn\'t
immediately re-launch it?

Also, I see that it\'s time for everybody to log into Twitter again and
un-check some checkboxes, since every four months they opt you in to
some newly-invented category of email spam that they\'re sure you want
to see. There are like *five* new checkboxes since the last time I
unchecked everything. My schadenfreude is getting impatient, isn\'t it
time for their stock to crater already?
