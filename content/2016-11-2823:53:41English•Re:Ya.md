Hello bubul,\
can you give some complementary details about your typical use case :
type of active local crawls, blacklists, dictionaries\... ?\
As far as I know some users are running YaCy on a Raspberry Pi, and
personally I have been running a peer on a virtual machine with 600Mb
RAM 7 days a week from the beginning of this year without too many
problems. But I admit I experienced crashes when activating geolocalized
data or advanced blacklist filtering\... And also, to manage disk usage
I have configured scheduled tasks to regularly clean old data from my
index\...\
I agree YaCy can be confusing if you are not really technical. By the
way it can be easier to improve performances if one can reproduce your
typical use case and the related issues, so to my mind any supplementary
useful information on your usage could help.\
\
Best regards
