>
> But the bomb scare was a false alarm, police told local media, after

>
> A large box, covered in holiday wrapping paper and addressed to
> Mnuchin, was left outside the home of one of his Bel Air neighbors
> Saturday evening. The package was labeled as being from \"the American

Takeaway: when you are Steve Mnuchin, a festively-wrapped gift box is a
\"suspicious package\".

> In video of the scene taken by an NBC Los Angeles helicopter, an
> officer can be seen opening the box, dumping out its contents and
> spreading a dark, unevenly clumped substance across the ground.
>
> The substance ended up being horse manure, police said. And, according
> to aerial footage, there was a lot of it.
>
> Afterward, at least three officers could be seen standing around the
> pile, shining flashlights on the manure and moving it around with
> their feet.

Relatedly, sales of pitchforks and guillotines soar:

> The Bel Air neighborhood is filled with multimillion-dollar mansions
> and is home to many celebrities.
>
> One resident, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, told CBS Los Angeles that he
> was blocked from leaving his neighborhood for about two hours while
> police cleared the scene.
>
> \"We have \$50 million homes and we can\'t move. We can\'t get out,\"
> von Anhalt, an entrepreneur and husband of the late actress Zsa Zsa
> Gabor, told the news station Saturday night. \"That\'s bad. They have
> to find another way.\"
