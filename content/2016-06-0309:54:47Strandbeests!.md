I have been obsessed with these for years and have never seen one in
person. They are more sophisticated than I thought! The little ones work
on simple biomechanics like you\'d expect, but the big ones, as far as I
could determine, actually include hydraulic digital logic \-- like,
there\'s a proboscis with a flat foot next to it, and when each is
compressed it closes a valve. 00? Waving in the air. 11? Hard ground.
01? Soft ground, reverse gears. The +5v analog(ue) is a series of water
bottles pressurized by the wind and some valves.

But it\'s all just so *weird* that I doubt he realized he was building
logic gates and a Turing machine. If I were a biochemist I might read
this as reaction-diffusion interactions or enzymes. Or if I was a
psychologist, I\'d think it was id and superego.

These things are glorious.

PS: I tried to make this post from my phone and it basically rolled on
its back and wiggled its legs in the air because apparently sending a 63
MB email to *my own damned mail server* is unreasonable and this is not
the future I was promised. What the what.
