> The top-down, do what you want, radically express yourself and fuck
> everyone else worldview is precisely why Burning Man is so appealing
> to the Silicon Valley technocratic scions.
>
> To these young tech workers \-- mostly white, mostly men \-- who flock
> to the festival, Burning Man reinforces and fosters the idea that they
> can remake the world without anyone else\'s input. It\'s a rabid
> libertarian fantasy. It fluffs their egos and tells them that they
> have the power and right to make society for all of us, to determine
> how things should be.
>
> This is the dark heart of Burning Man, the reason that high-powered
> capitalists \-- and especially capitalist libertarians \-- love
> Burning Man so much. It heralds their ideal world: one where vague
> notions of participation replace real democracy, and the only form of
> taxation is self-imposed charity. Recall Whole Foods CEO John
> Mackey\'s op-ed, in the wake of the Obamacare announcement, in which
> he proposed a healthcare system reliant on \"voluntary, tax-deductible
> donations.\"
>
> This is the dream of libertarians and the 1 percent, and it reifies
> itself at Burning Man \-- the lower caste of Burners who want to
> partake in the festival are dependent on the whims and fantasies of
> the wealthy to create Black Rock City.
>
> Burning Man foreshadows a future social model that is particularly
> appealing to the wealthy: a libertarian oligarchy, where people of all
> classes and identities coexist, yet social welfare and the commons
> exist solely on a charitable basis.
