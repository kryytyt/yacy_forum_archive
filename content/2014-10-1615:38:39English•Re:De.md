Erik,\
But I could pick on your URL with my robot and down the YaCy Senior
network\...not that I would ever do that with out permission to execute.
When Yacy is bullet proof I may support your thinking. I have 67 bug
reports that I have found some have been fixed but YaCy is not a Google
replacement it has lots of options and you never have to Submit
anything.
