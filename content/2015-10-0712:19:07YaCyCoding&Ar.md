Thats a very good idea: I had a look at the formats which TwelveMonkeys
supports and I found a lot of document types which are usually stored in
file systems. Because YaCy also indexes intranets/file systems, this
would be of great use.\

I tested this already in the context of
<https://github.com/yacy/yacy_webclient_bootstrap> which is rendering
the image results with the browser. This is actually much better if the
images are not too big (which is the common case) but it would not work
with the file formats not appropriate for the browser. Maybe we can mix
up the display using rendering in the browser or with viewImages as it
is appropriate for the corresponding file format/size!
