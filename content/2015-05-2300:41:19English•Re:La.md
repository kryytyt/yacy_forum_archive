English â€¢ Re: Language filter ineffective
=========================================

I\'m particularly sensible to this improvement and I\'m on the pathway
deciding whether to do a consistent hardware investment on YaCy.\
I need results to be filtered by language not because of a mere
\"personal taste\", but because a parser program will elaborate the
results and it needs to map English keywords.\
\
The algorithm is likely very simple to convert to java, and is also
especially effective.\
If anything is wrong, please let me know.
