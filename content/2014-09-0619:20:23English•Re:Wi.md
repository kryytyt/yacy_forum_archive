Ok, as long as you don\'t use the intranet mode, you are good to go. The
search portal mode is the best choice for your purpose.\
\
All you have to do now is to copy and paste the said code to your
tumblr, and you also have to make sure your yacy port (8090 by default)
is open. You can check that on <http://www.canyouseeme.org/>.\
\
In case you want to customize your search engine, you can do that on the
following pages within your yacy settings:\
<http://localhost:8090/ConfigAppearance_p.html>\
<http://localhost:8090/ConfigPortal.html> (scroll up to see all
settings)\
<http://localhost:8090/ConfigSearchPage_p.html>\
\
If you run into problems or you have further questions, please ask.
