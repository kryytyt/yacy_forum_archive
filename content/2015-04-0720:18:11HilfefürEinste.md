Thanks for the quick answer, Steve.\
\
But I don\'t have another Yacy instance running on my network. Keep note
that my only Yacy instance runs 24 x 7 and this is the first time I get
this kind of entry in Apache (well, since I started monitoring Apache,
which is since some 5 days ago). Shouldn\'t Apache be logging this
attempt all the time?\
\
Also, I don\'t understand two things from that entry.\
\
Why is it on port 80 if my Yacy instance is listening to another port?\
\
And what is this url <http://yacy.net/bot.html> referenced in that log
entry about?\
\
Browsing that url shows some instructions as to how to avoid yacybot to
crawl \"my website\". But what website exactly is this talking about? My
Yacy peer?
