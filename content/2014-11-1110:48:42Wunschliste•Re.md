Wunschliste â€¢ Re: Integration of MediaWiki API (wikipedia)

it\'s not pointless because it\'s the purpose of YaCy to be a search
engine technology in itself. What you consider is called metasearch.
YaCy is no meta-searchengine.\
\
However, this does not mean that your suggestion is a bad idea. It\'s
just not a working point for YaCy. If you want to have a search to the
Wikipedia API and YaCy at the same time, you must put a search page in
front of YaCy and wikipedia. There are software modules for that, i.e.
[searx](https://github.com/asciimoo/searx){.postlink} and
[Seeks](http://www.yacy-websearch.net/wiki/index.php/En:Seeks){.postlink}
