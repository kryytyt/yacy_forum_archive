YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: Spreading YaCy on web servers
==============================================================

I continue thinking on the idea of moving the indexing effort to each
web server : for a web server, without going as far as being a YaCy
node, it would be really helpful if it exposed its own index in a
standard way. Then any YaCy node or any software or people could get it
(fully or parts) and use it without having to recrawl the entire web
server exposed content. Does anyone has information on such an eventual
existing standard : url, index format\...?
