fabulous, ancient sign has been taken down. I am beside myself with
grief. I rode by this thing damned near every day, and every day I
looked up and thought, \"Hey there, Infra-Fred! Looking sharp!\"

Infra-Fred always replied, *\"FINISH HIM!\"*

I don\'t know what the new business on this lot is, but I do know that
if they have no room for Infra-Fred in their hearts, and more
importantly, on their pole, then they are no friends of mine.

RIP, Infra-Fred. Ride eternal, shiny and quartz.
