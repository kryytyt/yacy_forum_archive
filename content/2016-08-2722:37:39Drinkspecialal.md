juice:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo_juice)

> First mixed in World War II, it is made from pineapple juice and the
> 180-proof grain alcohol fuel used in United States Navy torpedo
> motors. Various poisonous additives were mixed into the fuel alcohol
> by Navy authorities to render the alcohol undrinkable, and various
> methods were employed by the U.S. sailors to separate the alcohol from
> the poison. Aside from the expected alcohol intoxication and
> subsequent hangover, the effects of drinking torpedo juice sometimes
> included mild or severe reactions to the poison, and the drink\'s
> reputation developed an early element of risk.
>
> In the first part of the Pacific War, U.S. torpedoes were powered by a
> miniature steam engine burning 180- or higher-proof ethyl alcohol as
> fuel. The ethyl alcohol was denatured by the addition of 5 \-- 10%
> \"pink lady\", a blend of dye, methanol and possibly other
> ingredients. Methanol causes blindness when ingested, and cannot be
> made non-poisonous. The methanol was said to be (largely) removed by
> filtering the fuel mix through a compressed loaf of bread.
>
> Later, a small amount of Croton oil was added to the neutral grain
> spirits which powered U.S. torpedoes. Drinking alcohol with the oil
> additive caused painful cramps, internal bleeding and a violent
> emptying of the bowels. It was intended as a replacement for methanol
> which had caused blindness in some sailors. To avoid the Croton oil,
> sailors devised crude stills to slowly separate the alcohol from the
> poison, as alcohol evaporated at a lower temperature than Croton oil.

Survey time!

Let\'s say you had a device that used sugar for fuel. And you found that
your employees were putting some of that sugar in their coffee instead.
Would you:

A.  Implement better inventory control; or
B.  Cut the sugar with rat poison?

And if you chose B \-- and you were *not* the government of a country
descended from religious fundamentalists and run by moralistic
prohibitionists \-- how many consecutive life sentences do you think you
would serve in prison for attempted murder?

[The Chemist\'s War: The little-told story of how the U.S. government
poisoned alcohol during Prohibition with deadly
consequences:](http://www.slate.com/id/2245188/pagenum/all/)

> Frustrated that people continued to consume so much alcohol even after

> manufactured in the United States, products regularly stolen by
> bootleggers and resold as drinkable spirits. The idea was to scare

> Prohibition ended in 1933, the federal poisoning program, by some
> estimates, had killed at least 10,000 people.

> Although mostly forgotten today, the \"chemist\'s war of Prohibition\"

> \[\...\] By mid-1927, the new denaturing formulas included some
> notable poisons \-- kerosene and brucine (closely related to
> strychnine), gasoline, benzene, cadmium, iodine, zinc, mercury salts,
> nicotine, ether, formaldehyde, chloroform, camphor, carbolic acid,
> quinine, and acetone. The Treasury Department also demanded more
> methyl alcohol be added \-- up to 10 percent of total product. It was
> the last that proved most deadly.
