is a long walk, but it\'s pretty great:

> What would it mean for a meme to have a life cycle as complicated as
> toxoplasma?
>
> Consider the war on terror. It\'s a truism that each time the United
> States bombs Pakistan or Afghanistan or somewhere, all we\'re doing is
> radicalizing the young people there and making more terrorists. Those
> terrorists then go on to kill Americans, which makes Americans get
> very angry and call for more bombing of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
>
> Taken as a meme, it is a single parasite with two hosts and two forms.
> In an Afghan host, it appears in a form called \'jihad\', and hijacks
> its host into killing himself in order to spread it to its second,
> American host. In the American host it morphs in a form called \'the
> war on terror\', and it hijacks the Americans into giving *their* own
> lives (and several bajillion of their tax dollars) to spread it back
> to its Afghan host in the form of bombs.
>
> From the human point of view, jihad and the War on Terror are opposing
> forces. From the memetic point of view, they\'re as complementary as
> caterpillars and butterflies. Instead of judging, we just note that
> somehow we accidentally created a replicator, and replicators are
> going to replicate until something makes them stop.

> Imagine Moloch, in his Carthaginian-demon personification, looking out
> over the expanse of the world, eagle-eyed for anything that can turn
> brother against brother and husband against wife. Finally he decides
> \"YOU KNOW WHAT NOBODY HATES EACH OTHER ABOUT YET? BIRD-WATCHING. LET
> ME FIND SOME STORY THAT WILL MAKE PEOPLE HATE EACH OTHER OVER
> BIRD-WATCHING\". And the next day half the world\'s newspaper
> headlines are \"Has The Political Correctness Police Taken Over
> Bird-Watching?\" and the other half are \"Is Bird-Watching Racist?\".
> And then bird-watchers and non-bird-watchers and different sub-groups
> of bird-watchers hold vitriolic attacks on each other that feed back
> on each other in a vicious cycle for the next six months, and the
> whole thing ends in mutual death threats and another previously
> innocent activity turning into World War I style trench warfare.

> EACH OTHER ABOUT YET? VIDEO GAMES.\")

*(Also, wasn\'t The Toxoplasma of Rage a Public Enemy song?)*
