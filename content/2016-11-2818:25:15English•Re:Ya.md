I\'ve tried yacy on different computer and here what i think about it
(i\'m yacy peers bubul and bubul2) :\
\
I\'ve tried on two computers:\
\
- I cant run yacy with less than 3gb of memory, if less, it stop a few
hours later saying no enough memory, with 3gb it can run without problem
multiples days.\
\
- I can use the computer to go to internet, look at video only with the
computer windows 7 (celeron 900, 3gb ram) because i\'ve installed a ssd
disk and i\'ve installed yacy on the 160gb old disk connect via usb,
before that, i can\'t use the computer at the same time than yacy run\
\
- On another, i can\'t use computer even yacy is on another usb data
disk (2To, 1To free), it slow all the computer, even with minimal
priority, the computer is a aspire v3 731 g (6gb) and java is
accelerated via graphic card computer but it seem it the high usage of
the disk by yacy wich slow too much the computer.\
\
A good idea will be a version of yacy but without using too much
ressource of the computer, because if users can\'t use their computer
with yacy on it, they will don\'t use yacy, faroo, another p2p search
engine dont seem to have this problem.
