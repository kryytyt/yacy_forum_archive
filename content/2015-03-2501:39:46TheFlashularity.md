![](http://www.jwz.org/images/grab-20150383_1703.png)Is there a graph
anywhere of how quickly Flash security updates are coming now? Is it
accelerating exponentially? Has is gotten to multiple times a week yet?

I\'m pretty sure we\'ve already reached the point where the security
updates are coming faster than my desire to *run* Flash \-- that is,
every time I want to play Flash, I have to update it first. Kind of like
how every time I turn on my Playstation, I can\'t actually play any
games until it spends two hours downloading updates first.

I guess that\'s a *good* sign, coffin-nail-wise?

If you use Safari,
[ClickToPlugin](http://hoyois.github.io/safariextensions/clicktoplugin/)
is decent. It translates many Flash players to HTML5 players, including
Youtube.
