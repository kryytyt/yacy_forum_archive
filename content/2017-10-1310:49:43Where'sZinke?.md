[The interior secretary\'s special flag offers
clues.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/politics/wheres-zinke-the-interior-secretarys-special-flag-offers-clues/2017/10/12/68672476-aeb2-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html)

> At the Interior Department\'s headquarters in downtown Washington,
> Secretary Ryan Zinke has revived an arcane military ritual that no one
> can remember ever happening in the federal government.
>
> A security staffer takes the elevator to the seventh floor, climbs the
> stairs to the roof and hoists a special secretarial flag whenever
> Zinke enters the building. When the secretary goes home for the day or
> travels, the flag \-- a blue banner emblazoned with the agency\'s
> bison seal flanked by seven white stars representing the Interior
> bureaus \-- comes down.
>
> In Zinke\'s absence, the ritual is repeated to raise an equally
> obscure flag for Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt.
>
> Responding this week to questions from The Washington Post, a
> spokeswoman for Zinke, a former Navy SEAL commander, defended the Navy
> flag-flying tradition as \"a major sign of transparency.\" \[\...\]
>
> Zinke, a Stetson-wearing former Montana congressman who has cultivated
> an image as a rugged outdoorsman, has come under a harsh spotlight in
> recent weeks for behavior criticized as extravagant for a public
> official. The agency\'s inspector general opened an investigation
> after he ran up bills for travel on chartered jets and mixed business
> with political appearances, sometimes accompanied by his wife, Lola.
> It\'s one of five probes underway of Cabinet secretaries\' travel.
> \[\...\]
>
> Zinke rode to work on horseback on his first day in office and
> displays animal heads on his wood-paneled office walls. For a while,
> he kept a glass-case display of hunting knives but was asked to remove
> them because of security risks, according to people familiar with the
> decision.
>
> He has commissioned commemorative coins with his name on them to give
> to staff and visitors, but the cost to taxpayers is unclear. Zinke\'s
> predecessors and some other Cabinet secretaries have coins bearing
> agency seals, but not personalized ones.
>
> The flag ritual is unique in President Trump\'s administration. The
> White House does not raise the presidential flag when Trump alights at
> 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. There is no Defense secretary\'s flag atop the
> Pentagon.
