[Robust Physical-World Attacks on Machine Learning
Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08945.pdf)

> Our algorithm can create spatially- constrained perturbations that
> mimic vandalism or art to reduce the likelihood of detection by a
> casual observer. We show that adversarial examples generated by RP2
> achieve high success rates under various conditions for real road sign
> recognition by using an evaluation methodology that captures physical
> world conditions. We physically realized and evaluated two attacks,
> one that causes a Stop sign to be misclassified as a Speed Limit sign
> in 100% of the testing conditions, and one that causes a Right Turn
> sign to be misclassified as either a Stop or Added Lane sign in 100%
> of the testing conditions.
