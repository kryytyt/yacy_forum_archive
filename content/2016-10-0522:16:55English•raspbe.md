English â€¢ raspberry pi, no start
================================

Date: 2016-10-05 22:16:55

I am trying to get yacy running on a spare raspberry pi I had.\
I have followed the instructions here:\
[http://www.yacy-websearch.net/wiki/inde \...
spberry\_Pi](http://www.yacy-websearch.net/wiki/index.php/En:Raspberry_Pi){.postlink}\
But it seems yacy isn\'t running. I can ssh to the raspberry pi and run
the startYACY.sh.\
I even get the message that I can reach yacy via web\
\
\>\> YaCy started as daemon process. Administration at
<http://localhost:8090> \<\<\
\
Substituting localhost for ip of the raspberry pi, the page is
unreachable.\
Running top on the raspberry pi doesn\'t show yacy as a running
process.\
\
I haven\'t found any logs for yacy,\
Does anyone have any ideas where I should look? or what might be the
problem?
