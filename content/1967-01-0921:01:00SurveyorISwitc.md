Surveyor I, on its 220th day on the moon since it landed in the Ocean of
Storms June 1, 1966, was turned on last Friday and communicated with
Earth stations for approximately twelve hours. The objective for
activating the transmitters aboard the spacecraft was to obtain
scientific data on the motion of the moon. Analysis over the weekend of
the information obtained shows that this objective was met.
