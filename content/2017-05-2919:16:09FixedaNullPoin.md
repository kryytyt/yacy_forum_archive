Fixed a NullPointerException case on Digest authentication.

Could occur when upgrading from a Debian package configured with Basic
authentication (as in release 1.92.9000) to a more recent one with
Digest authentication, without having re-encoded the admin password (for
example with dpkg-reconfigure).

As reported by eros on YaCy forum
