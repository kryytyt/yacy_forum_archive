================

Anyone know what this shit is and how to stop it?

> ` Use of uninitialized value $vals in index at /usr/local/share/perl5/HTTP/Headers.pm line 277. Use of uninitialized value $vals in concatenation (.) or string at /usr/local/share/perl5/HTTP/Headers.pm line 280. `{style="font-size:smaller"}

I don\'t know when or why it started, but I\'ve tried all of:

> ` cpan upgrade HTTP::Headers upgrade LWP upgrade HTML::HeadParser upgrade LWP::UserAgent upgrade HTTP upgrade HTTP::Request `

`/usr/local/share/perl5/HTTP/Headers.pm:our $VERSION = "6.10";`

This is on a CentOS machine, not a Mac, in case that matters.
