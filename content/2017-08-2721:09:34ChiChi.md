> \"And then about two days later, we get this call. And it\'s a big
> crisis,\" Jerry says. The call was from the vice president of business
> affairs for Warner Brothers. \"David Berman, who was a guy that you
> would cast in a movie about the music business,\" Jerry continues.
> \[\...\] And the first communication is, \'I\'m a golfer and I\'m a
> fan of golf and I know Chi Chi Rodriguez. I\'ve met Chi Chi Rodriguez.
> You cannot use Chi Chi Rodriguez.\'\"
>
> \"That is completely and totally false,\" Berman tells me.
>
> I told you not everybody\'s memory is crystal clear regarding this
> story.

> \"It was an artist\'s rendering of what the last four presidents would
> have looked like, had you combined them,\" Jerry says. So Kennedy,
> Johnson, Nixon and Ford all mashed together. It was a picture Mark
> Mothersbaugh had lying around. \"And it was this hideous, bizarre face
> that had John Kennedy\'s hairline and it had Lyndon Johnson\'s ears
> and Richard Nixon\'s nose,\" Mark says. \[\...\] It was like building
> an old Mr. Potato Head toy. They grafted Johnson\'s ears and Nixon\'s
> nose on Chi Chi\'s head, reversed the mouth.

> \"Hello.\"

> \"Hello, Chi Chi Rodriguez?\" I ask.
>
> \"Yeah, who\'s this?\"
