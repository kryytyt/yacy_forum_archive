**[Occulus:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYJrxezWLUk)** As \"haunted
mirror\" movies go, this was pretty solid. In any given scene, it\'s
hard to know whether what you are seeing is real-time, a flashback, a
memory, or a hallucination. It\'s an interesting structure. It was much
better than [*Mirror,
Mirror*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnpuIrHX6aU) (which I also
re-watched. Wow, it\'s worse than I remembered.)

**[Under the Skin:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoSWbyvdhHw)** It\'s
not bad, but kind of slow. Scarlett Johansson drives around and eats
people. It\'s basically [*Liquid
Sky*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zsWrE2yNiQ), but less psychedelic,
and no faster paced.

**[Ghostbusters:](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/09/this-then-is-the-world-view-ghostbusters-offers-in-place-of-the-cthonic-duality/)**
I hadn\'t seen this in years, and I\'m happy to report that it really
holds up well. Some of the effects are terrible, but the jokes and plot
are quality.

**[Ghostbusters II:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP2JPwbtq0g)** This
isn\'t *terrible*, but it\'s not that funny and there is *far too much
baby* in it. The whole movie is basically nothing but people coo-ing at
a baby. The baby doesn\'t even do anything, ever. It\'s just a prize
token. More slime, less baby is what I\'m saying.

**[Star Wars: Turn to the Dark Side, Episode
3.1:](http://kotaku.com/someone-edited-star-wars-episodes-i-iii-into-one-bette-1573980743)**
This is the 7+ hours of Star Wars episodes 1-3 edited down to a single
2:47 movie. It is a *much better movie*. I wouldn\'t say it\'s a very
*good* movie, but there\'s only so far you can polish that turd. Still,
given the raw material they had to work with, this came out better than
I expected. *This* movie is about a monk with serious anger issues
making terrible decisions, instead of being about tariffs and union
negotiations or whatever the fuck Lucas\'s movies were about.

The torrent I found of it wasn\'t the greatest encoding, so it felt like
a much older and lower budget B movie than it is, which made some of the
stilted, terrible acting easier to tolerate.
