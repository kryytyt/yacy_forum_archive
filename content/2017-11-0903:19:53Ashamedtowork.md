Street has long been the industry people love to hate. But as big
tech\'s reputation plummets, suddenly a job at Facebook doesn\'t seem so

> \"I would never say I worked at Facebook,\" said one 30-year-old
> software engineer who left the company last year to pursue an
> alternative career. Instead, at dinner parties he would give
> purposefully vague responses and change the subject. \"There\'s this
> song and dance you learn to play because people are quick to judge.\"
> \[\...\]
>
> \"We have this habit of highlighting and celebrating brilliant
> assholes like Steve Jobs and Travis Kalanick, when the reality is they
> are awful human beings,\" said Greg, head of technology at e-commerce
> startup Brandless, adding that it is women and people of colour who
> tend to bear the brunt of their behaviour. \[\...\]
>
> Some of this behaviour stems from the hubris that positions
> profit-seeking corporations as benevolent forces in the world.
>
> \"You are selling ads, you\'re not really making the world a better
> place,\" noted the former Facebooker. \"But most people drank the
> Kool-aid.\"
>
> It\'s a view echoed by one current Googler in her 20s, who is
> embarrassed by tech companies\' cluelessness about their reputation
> outside of the Silicon Valley bubble.
>
> \"Internally I don\'t think they have a good read on how they\'re
> perceived,\" she said, citing the backlash after it was discovered
> that ads were appearing around videos promoting extremist views on
> YouTube or the investigation into possible Russian interference in the
> US election, including buying ads on Google, Facebook and Twitter.
>
> \"\[Googlers\] will say \'why are the papers making a big deal out of
> this, I don\'t get it\'. Are you fucking joking? These people don\'t
> realise the scale of what they are doing,\" she said.
>
> \"Some of these folks aren\'t the most socially gifted people and
> therefore suddenly having a culture encouraging this experience for
> them bleeds into everything, giving them a sense of self-importance
> and entitlement. It\'s effectively like dealing with children all the
> time,\" Greg said, referencing his time at Dropbox when people would
> \"fly around the office on these stupid scooters and skateboards\".
> \[\...\]
>
> All of this feeds into the perception that techies are, according to
> the former Facebooker, \"pod people\" who aren\'t part of the
> community.
>
> \"You wake up, get the shuttle bus, go to the bubble of campus and
> order food via an app when you get home. You are not a citizen, just a
> bizarre leech who makes money,\" he explained.
