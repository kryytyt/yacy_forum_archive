[XScreenSaver](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/) 5.37 is out now,
including
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/xscreensaver/id539014593?mt=8) and
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jwz.xscreensaver).

release. It\'s been a while. I have been

The Android version is much improved, thanks to the hard work of Dave
and Dennis. It supports both Live Wallpaper and Daydreams now.
