> -   An asshole quits his job. Hackernews absolutely explodes, because
>     Uber\'s business model (\"fuck you and your laws\") aligns
>     perfectly with Hackernews\' most firmly-held convictions. Many
>     thousands of words are deployed to explain carefully to each other
>     that a jitney-cab with a smartphone app is the most monumental
>     societal development in the history of humanity, and that it is
>     absolutely criminal that a man should be forced out of his cushy
>     job for trivial transgressions like \"building an entire
>     corporation on the idea that women are not people\" and \"abusing
>     your own employees.\" Most Hackernews hold the opinion that this
>     one person leaving the company will destroy the company, never
>     pausing to wonder how great the place must be if one asshole going
>     home is all it takes to burn everything down.

Honorable mention:

> -   An idiot gets robbed by a jitney driver. Hackernews, seeing that
>     the idiot pursued legal remediation and succeeded, decides that
>     everything the idiot did was totally wrong, and they have all the
>     right answers. In addition, Hackernews concludes that Uber was
>     unfairly treated by everyone involved and should have been allowed
>     to lie to the police.
> -   A cybersecurity company peddles its services. Hackernews opines
>     that everything is fine because most of this data was public to
>     start with. Some Hackernews spend a while playing fantasy football
>     with the constitution of the United States. The rest spend all day
>     explaining to each other why personal data must be protected at
>     all cost, except when it interferes with internet advertising.
