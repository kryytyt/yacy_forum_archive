Hi davide, great that you solved your issue.\
There are some things not really clear to me in what you explain :\
- you didn\'t received any results from remote peers just after having
started and configured your peer with an empty index? Or you only
realized/checked this a few hours later?\
- you talk about background processes. Do you mean other
applications/services on your computer? Or YaCy internal tasks?
