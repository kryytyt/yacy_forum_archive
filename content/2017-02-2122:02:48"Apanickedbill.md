> In his grand vision for humanity, Mark keeps returning to how Facebook
> fundamentally \"brings us closer together\" by \"connecting friends
> and families.\" What Mark fails to mention is that Facebook does not
> connect people together; Facebook connects people to Facebook, Inc.
>
> Facebook\'s business model is to be the man in the middle; to track
> every move you, your family, and your friends make, to store all that
> information indefinitely, and continuously analyse it to understand
> you better in order to exploit you by manipulating you for financial
> and political gain.
>
> Facebook isn\'t a social network, it is a scanner that digitises human
> beings. It is, for all intents and purposes, the camera that captures
> your soul. Facebook\'s business is to simulate you and to own and
> control your simulation, thereby owning and controlling you.
>
> I call the business model of Facebook, Google, and the
> venture-capital-funded long tail of Silicon Valley startups \"people
> farming\". Facebook is a factory farm for human beings. And Mark\'s
> manifesto is nothing more than a panicked billionaire\'s latest
> sophomoric attempt to decorate an unpalatable business model grounded
> in the abuse of human rights with faux moral purpose to stave off
> regulation and justify what is unabashedly a colonial desire: to
> create a global fiefdom by connecting all of us to Facebook, Inc.

> It is not the job of a corporation to \"develop the social
> infrastructure for community\" as Mark wants to do. Social
> infrastructure must belong to the commons, not to giant monopolistic
> corporations like Facebook. The reason we find ourselves in this mess
> with ubiquitous surveillance, filter bubbles, and fake news
> (propaganda) is precisely due to the utter and complete destruction of
> the public sphere by an oligopoly of private infrastructure that poses
> as public space.
>
> Facebook wants us to think that it is a park when it\'s actually a
> shopping mall. The last thing we need is more privately owned
> centralised digital infrastructure to solve the problems created by an
> unprecedented concentration of power, wealth, and control in a tiny
> number of hands. It\'s way past time we started funding and building
> the digital equivalents of parks in the digital age instead of
> building ever-larger shopping malls. \[\...\]
>
> We are sharded beings; the sum total of our various aspects as
> contained within our biological beings as well as the myriad of
> technologies that we use to extend our biological abilities. \[\...\]
> It also follows, then, that any attempt to violate the boundaries of
> the self must be considered an assault on the cyborg self. It is
> exactly this abuse that constitutes the everyday business model of
> Facebook, Google, and mainstream Silicon Valley-inspired technology
> today. In this model, which Shoshana Zuboff calls surveillance
> capitalism, what we have lost is individual sovereignty. People have
> once again become property \-- albeit in digital, not biological,
> form.

> Here\'s what we found. First, the fake news audience is tiny compared
> to the real news audience \-- about 10 times smaller on average.
> \[\...\] Online news audiences spent more time on average with real
> news than fake news. \[\...\] We also found that the fake news
> audience does not exist in a filter bubble. Visitors to fake news
> sites visited real news sites just as often as visitors to real news
> sites visited other real news sites. \[\...\]
>
> Last, and perhaps least surprising to everyone but Mark Zuckerberg, we
> saw that audiences found their way to fake news via social media at a
> much higher rate than they did to real news. We already know that a
> majority of US adults get their news via social media platforms. Here,
> though, we can see that nearly 30 percent of all fake news traffic
> could be linked back to Facebook, while only 8 percent of real news
> traffic could.
