``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
altered clac. of search result items per page to display 
taking the existing limits into account but make it consistent with search option screen for admin and public user
changes:
  - configured default number of items per page (ConfigPortal_p.html) is used as is (no hardcoded limit)
  - otherwise requests are limited to 100 results per page ( = search option, index.html)
      (this basically is the major change, inc. limit from 20 to 100 for public user)
P.S. - the older grant of more (1000), if no online snippet calculation, is kept (for the time being)
