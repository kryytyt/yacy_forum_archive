I don\'t know if RAID1 does load balancing and [wikipedia
says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID){.postlink}: \"Actual read
throughput of most RAID 1 implementations is slower than the fastest
drive.\"\
Your question has also a second component \"it appears that YaCy (SOLR)
performs most of the intensive index reads from a single thread\": this
is a correct observation. The write operations in the yacy-integrated
solr is single-thread only on purpose.\
Reason: solr provides concurrent multi-instance queries with several
threads using a solr shard option, called a \"solr cloud\". This
requires that you set up several solr servers and configure them to
opperate as solr cloud. Then you can assign this cloud to YaCy as
external solr - the solr cloud appears to be a single instance for YaCy.
As the operator of the solr cloud, you can place their database files on
different discs. This sounds like a complex solution, but it is also the
most appropriate one because it is a bad idea to do concurrent
write/read operations on a single disc.
