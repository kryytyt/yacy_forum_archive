I looked through the files - I\'m still stuck. I checked the logs and
with the string \"yacyClient.hello\" I usually get these errors:\
\
exception: Client can\'t execute: Connection refused duration=163 for
url <http://..>.\
\
as well as ping errors, \"network unreachable\" and etc. Each error is
different, and it does not bring me any closer to diagnosing the issue.
If I can\'t get it up and running, I think I\'ll shut down the service
soon. Too bad, it would have been fun.
