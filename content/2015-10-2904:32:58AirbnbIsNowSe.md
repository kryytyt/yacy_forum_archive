> The sales pitch sent out by Airbnb promises anyone who feels compelled
> to shell out \$500 to \$750 the opportunity to engage in one of three
> \"handcrafted trips.\" Locally the options include the aforementioned
> Mission tour, a nature tour (think Lands End day hikes), and a foodie
> tour. \[\...\]
>
> Unsurprisingly, the email highlights beautiful and iconic San
> Francisco locations like Dolores Park. What is perhaps surprising, on
> the other hand, is the email\'s marketing copy which seems to suggest
> that the \"big shifts\" in the \"rapidly changing\" Mission District
> are entertainment \-- or just another sight to be consumed by the
> curious traveler.
