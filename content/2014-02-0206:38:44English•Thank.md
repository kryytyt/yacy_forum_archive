It\'s been a long time coming and I think it\'s a great idea. One
suggestion though to help increase English participation. I noticed upon
trying to register that almost all text was in German. I think that may
make it difficult for English speakers. In particular the current
security question in regards to past members of the German government
might also be a challenge.

Might it be a good idea to add English text to the registration fields
as well and in particular the security question? I did notice British
English is installed as a language so for my fellow English speakers you
can go to your \"user control panel\" at
[ucp.php](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/ucp.php){.postlink-local} and
change that so most forum fields are in English but unfortunately as far
as I can tell it is only for registered users.
