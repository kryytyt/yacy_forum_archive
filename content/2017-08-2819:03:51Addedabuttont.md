Added a button to manually refresh sorting of p2p search results.

As a server-side oriented alternative to the JavaScript realtime
resorting feature proposed in PR #104.
The goal is the same as in this PR : having the possibility compensate
the network latency of various peers results fetching and obtain once
possible a consistently ranked result set.
