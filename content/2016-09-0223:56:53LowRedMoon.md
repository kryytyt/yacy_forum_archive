![](https://www.jwz.org/images/countdown.jpg)I\'m on my bike, waiting
for the light to change. To my right, a 30ish homeless man with a Guy
Fawkes beard is standing on the sidewalk sorting through his pile of
suspiciously moist fashion magazines. He is facing away from me, legs
straight, bent at the waist, his pants drooping to just below his bare
ass cheeks revealing a lunar landscape of puckered, angry red pimples on
a cold, gray backdrop.

I tear my eyes away and look forward. The traffic light is still red.

I look right. Angry red moon.

Forward. Red. Right. Red.\
Forward. Red. Right. Red.\
