Except that they aren\'t actually selling a printer. That\'s not their
business model.

It comes with a \$75/month subscription fee, because their *actual*
business model is \"capture your customers\' personal information so
that they can turn your customers into *their* product.\"

Remember when companies used to try to make money by selling you
*[things]{.underline},* instead of by selling you *[out]{.underline}?*
