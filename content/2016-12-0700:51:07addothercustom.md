``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
add other custom response header entries set by servlets to the response
to the client (not cookies only). This is used by some servlets to mainly 
set "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header. Added a contains check to be
sure no header set by Defaultservlet is overwritten.
