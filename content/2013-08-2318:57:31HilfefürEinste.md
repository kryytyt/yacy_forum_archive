Since you are a firefox user, this can be done by installing a so called
[search
plugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_plugin){.postlink}:\
[http://www.searchplugins.net/pluginlist \...
mode=title](http://www.searchplugins.net/pluginlist.aspx?q=yacy&mode=title){.postlink}\
\
The first plugin in the list above works fine for me, but at the moment
I\'m using an older version of yacy, so maybe it wont work for you. If
it doesn\'t, you can tell me and I will create an updated one for you,
or you can try to do this by yourself:

I have no clue, but under the following link is a guide, which will
maybe help you:\
[http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions \...
booting-up](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/43230/how-to-run-my-script-after-suse-finished-booting-up){.postlink}\
There are also other tutorials, if you do a web search for e.g.
[openSUSE auto start shell script]{style="font-style: italic"}.\
\
However, feel free to ask, if you need more help.\
\
[Edit:\
In the latest version of firefox you can choose a custom search engine
without the need for a plugin:\
1. Open the search page of the engine you want to use as default, e.g.
<http://localhost:8090/>\
2. In the firefox search bar (in the top right corner), click the down
arrow symbol.\
3. Click on the the search engine with the blue yacy icon.
