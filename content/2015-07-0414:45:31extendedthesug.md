``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
extended the suggest servlet with geolocation name suggestions.
It is also possible to select suggestions from queries with source=query
and to select place names with source=geo. All possible suggestion
sources are selected with source=all, which is the default.
Example:
http://localhost:9000/api/suggest.json?q=new+y
```
