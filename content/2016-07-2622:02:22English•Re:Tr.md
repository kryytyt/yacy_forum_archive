Hi, how do you proceed to connect to your I2P peer? Did you create a
custom Network Definition file (something like
yacy.network.\[yournetwork\].unit) and used it in
/ConfigNetwork\_p.html? I suppose this the first thing to do, as was
done for the [ZeroNet
network](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/master/defaults/yacy.network.zeronet.unit){.postlink}
for example\...\
By the way, looking at your error stack trace, it looks like your peer
tried to perform [DNS
resolution](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/master/source/net/yacy/cora/protocol/Domains.java#L876){.postlink}
on your other peer address. Of course if did not found anything and
returned null, but the null result is indeed not very well handled : it
is likely the
[ie.getHostAddress()](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/master/source/net/yacy/peers/Protocol.java#L238){.postlink}
instruction which triggers that obscure NullPointerException.\
At that point, I have not currently enough YaCy network definitions
knowldge to predict if it may be correctly configured to handle I2P
without further developments, but maybe \@Orbiter will have some tips
for you\...
