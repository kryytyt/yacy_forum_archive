Though I wonder: did you struck on any trouble with a corrupted or lost
index? I see that, after the years, the Endeavour still has less than
100M documents. I wonder \'cause I just bought some
(more-modest-than-yours) hardware aimed at reaching 100M for my index,
but I want to climb that in a few months, not years!\
\
So, were there any problems which prevented the Endeavour to reach its
400M target?\
