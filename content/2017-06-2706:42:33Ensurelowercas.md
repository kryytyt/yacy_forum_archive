Ensure lower case conversion consistency with any default locale.

Especially for Turkish speaking users using "tr" as their system default
locale : strings for technical stuff (URLs, tag names, constants...)
must not be lower cased with the default locale, as 'I' doesn't becomes
'i' like in other locales such as "en", but becomes 'Ä±'.
