Plug.](http://www.destructoid.com/alt-control-exhibition-at-gdc-features-butt-sniffing-pugs-286335.phtml)

> This simple little game utilizes a large trackball controller to allow
> you to manipulate your in-game pug with the same kinds of motions that
> a flesh and blood pug may perform in real life. Using these controls,
> your aim is to interact with various aspects of an small park, but
> there\'s a hitch. With only three action buttons at your disposal,
> you\'ll have to sniff a fellow pug\'s posterior in order to gain
> alternate abilities. Like leading a small group of pigeons in a
> group-pooping exercise.
