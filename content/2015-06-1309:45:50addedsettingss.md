added settings servlet according to feature request
https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server/issues/48

To propagate settings to the /api/settings.json servlet, set those
settings within the conf/config.properties file with a prefix 'client.'.
That key prefix will be truncated when settings are transmitted within
the servelet.
```
