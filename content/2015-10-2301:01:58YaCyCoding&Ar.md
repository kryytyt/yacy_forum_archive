YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Spreading YaCy on web servers
==========================================================

Date: 2015-10-23 01:01:58

Imagine a world where each Apache HTTP server instance would also act as
a YaCy peer, providing fresh index of its own domain but also parts of
the distributed index\...\
As Apache HTTP Servers are very widespread, don\'t you think it would
really be a BIG step forward for decentralized index and search?
Reliability and responsiness of YaCy network could be greatly
improved\... Even if it would be one little percent of all Apache HTTP
servers.\
This idea is now far from reality. A first step would maybe to implement
an Apache module (<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/>) able to act
as a YaCy peer? And maybe to formalize YaCy protocol to make it easier
for anyone or any company to implement its own YaCy peer software, or at
least to provide a minimal YaCy core module (YaCy 2 architecture?)?
