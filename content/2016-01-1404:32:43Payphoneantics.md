if you have any suggestions for other behaviors I should add to [the
payphone](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/01/my-payphone-runs-linux-now/),
shoot. Right now it just does the calendar info-line and lets you save
and play back messages. Plus a few minor easter eggs. What else would be
fun to build into the thing (that does not require advanced signal
processing)?
