> Gary Dudek, 54 of Wallingford, Delaware County, allegedly stole
> \$357,000 worth of human skin from Mercy Philadelphia Hospital from
> November 2011 to July of last year.
>
> From September 2006 to September 2013, Dudek worked as a
> \"tissue-regeneration specialist\" - a sales representative - for
> Organogenesis, a Massachusetts firm that specializes in regenerative
> medicine, a company spokeswoman said.
>
> But in that capacity, Dudek would have had no use for human skin, said
> the spokeswoman, Angelyn Lowe, director of corporate communications at
> Organogenesis.
>
> Dudek\'s job title allowed him to order grafts whenever he needed,
> according to court records. The hospital only needed three in stock at
> a time, but Dudek ordered an unauthorized 219 - valued at \$1,700 each
> - which the hospital never saw, the records say.
>
> Philadelphia police said they were unaware of a motive or of what
> happened to the grafts allegedly ordered by Dudek.
