[NAVY ADMITS TO BEING INVOLVED IN OBSCENE
SKYDRAWINGS:](http://www.krem.com/mobile/article/news/local/okanogan-county/graphic-navy-admits-to-being-involved-in-obscene-skydrawings-spotted-in-okanogan-co/293-492496113)

> Navy officials said, \"The Navy holds its aircrew to the highest
> standards and we find this absolutely unacceptable, of zero training
> value and we are holding the crew accountable.\"
>
> Photos sent to KREM 2 by multiple sources show skydrawings of what
> some people are saying is male genitalia.

*Heresay! Pernicious nonsense!*

> Some sources have even tweeted pictures of what they saw.

*They what now. Tweeted! Why I never.*

> A mother who lives in Okanogan who took pictures of the drawings
> reached out to KREM 2 to complain about the images, saying she was
> upset she might have to explain to her young children what the
> drawings were.

*That does sound like quite a \... pickle.*

*What do you call pareidolia for dongs? Pareidonglia?*

> KREM 2 spoke to the Federal Aviation Administration to get some
> information about who may have made the drawings. FAA officials said
> unless the act poses a safety risk, there is nothing they can do
> about. The official said they \"cannot police morality.\"

*This response, I must say, actually surprises me.*
