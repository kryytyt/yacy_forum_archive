[Kurze Durchsage der Polizei von
Miami](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article7043225.html):

> The fact that North Miami Beach police honed their aim by shooting a
> gallery of black men is no reflection on police-community relations in
> the city, said Maj. Kathy Katerman.
>
> **"We have other targets, too," she said. "We don't just shoot at
> black males."**
>
> She said the photo gallery should have been disposed of before North
> Miami Beach cops left the range and Sgt. Deant's group --- she's with
> the Florida Army National Guard --- came in.

Na dann ist ja alles gut!
