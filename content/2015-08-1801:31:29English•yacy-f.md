Hi All,\
\
For quite a few years I have owned yacy-forum.org and the domain is
again due for renewal.\
\
I haven\'t been active in the forum or YaCy for some time now and I
think it would be a good time for me to hand this over to somebody who
can use it.\
\
Ideally, I think I\'d like Michael to take it over, and it would
probably make more sense to redirect the domain to here.\
\
If Michael can Direct Message me here I can discuss this further with
him?\
\
Regards,\
Andrew.
