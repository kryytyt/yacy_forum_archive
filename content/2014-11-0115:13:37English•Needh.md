English â€¢ Need help Linux bug reporting keyboard handling
=========================================================

Date: 2014-11-01 15:13:37

I have struck a problem with the keyboard buffer in Debian 7 VPS its
only about 20 keystrokes long.\
I have tried to report a bug but haven\'t a clue which module its for
just got a default MSG back.\
\
I have run tests on Windows XP with a reg hack that can have a 500 000
keystroke buffer and I can overflow that but it takes a while and 50%
CPU load, this is fine for set and forget come back later for my
keyboard emulator PC.\
If you could send them a video link
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXG-GM-IiF0>\
Windows at about 3000 WPM on a Ghosting demo site that would be good.\
My emulator can be pushed to approx 6000 WPM, have pic @ 58xx WPM some
where.\
\
The reason I ask is I can download the API Schedule table, do some load
balancing, delete all and add new values back. Work in progress. see
[viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5436](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5436){.postlink-local}\
\
I did a rough calculation/test run for 1000 API entries you are in the
order of 170 000 keystrokes. From what I know there is about 1 hour
where I am waiting for the port to be serviced in Debian 7 and 7 hours
to get the data back in.\
The Pause I have to add for no errors is equal to about every 20 keys =
250 mS from testing on low end hardware.\
\
1. I would like massive keyboard buffer 500 000 or larger in Linux.\
Thanks
