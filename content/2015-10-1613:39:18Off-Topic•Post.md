Off-Topic • Postprocess: nine days and counting
===============================================

Date: 2015-10-16 13:39:18

Nine days ago Yacy automatically paused a crawler for lack of disk
space, and consequently started post-processing. Since then it has not
yet finished, running 24/7.\
\
It perpetually flips from a short phase of CPU burst to a much longer
phase of hard disk burst: from all cores at 100% to a full queue of
small hard disk read ops.\
The index size is moderate with 24M records over 250GB. OS files cache
is 12GB. JVM heap 4GB.\
May I do something to speed it up?\
\
\
[Side consideration:]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
Standing solely from the observed behavior, it appears that the
post-processing algorithms perform something like a one-to-every
comparison between indexed records, in a way similar to:\
\

Code: 
:   `for record_a in index; do    for record_b in index; do        one-to-every comparison    donedone`

\
\
If this is actually the case, then the post-process reads over and over
the whole index file; since only a fraction of the index fits in the OS
cache, this causes a massive amount of small, random, inefficient read
ops. Given this hypothesis true, would it be feasible to improve the
algorithm by either:\
\

1.  Keep it read the whole index file over and over, as it currently
    does, but performing sequential reads rather than random ones.
    Rationale: reading the whole index file sequentially from head to
    tail is faster than reading it randomly with \"partial field
    reads\";
2.  Perform the comparison in large batches rather than with individual
    records, so avoid the one-to-every check and instead perform a
    many-to-every check. Consideration: a large batch might consist of
    anything between 1 MB to 10 GB of indexed records, enough to
    entirely fit them within available RAM, so to perform multiple
    comparisons at a time against each record read from disk.
