YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Help with a Procedure
==================================================

Date: 2016-04-18 11:16:03

Hi,\
\
I need a script (Windows Batch, but java code is welcome too, to do a
specific HTTP POST to a server, after that a TCP port number is
returned. I want this port number to be directly applied as YaCys main
port. Since I\'m a novice with java or programming languages in general,
It would be very appreciated if someone can contribute such a feature to
the Codebase of YaCy, maybe as a new feature called \'Automatic port
assignment for the Private Internet Access VPN-Provider.\
\
I just made an entry at the bugtracker, too:
