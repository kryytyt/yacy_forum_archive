Removed use of deprecated Jetty IPAccessHandler for client filtering.

Upgraded to InetAccessHandler.
Added InetPathAccessHandler extension to InetAccessHandler to maintain
path patterns capability previously available in IPAccessHandler but
lost in InetAccessHandler.

Filtering on IPv6 addresses is now supported.

Support for deprecated pattern formats such as "192.168." and
"192.168.1.1/path" has been removed, but startup automated migration
should convert such patterns eventually present in serverClient.
