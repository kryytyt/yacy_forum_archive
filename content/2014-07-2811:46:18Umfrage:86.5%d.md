[Umfrage: 86.5% der Israelis sind gegen eine
Waffenruhe](http://www.jpost.com/Operation-Protective-Edge/Poll-865-percent-of-Israelis-oppose-cease-fire-369064).

Die Fragen waren allerdings lenkend:

> When asking about a potential cease-fire, the poll gave two choices.
> The first endorsed a ceasefire because "Israel had enough
> achievements, soldiers have died, and it is time to stop." The second
> said Israel cannot accept a cease-fire because "Hamas continues firing
> missiles on Israel, not all the tunnels have been found, and Hamas has
> not surrendered."
