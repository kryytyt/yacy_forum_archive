YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: quick results without P2P vs. remote search
============================================================================

Hello, if we want to use lightweight webclients such as this one, why
not simply rely on the /yacysearch.json API as the backend service when
we wish to have realtime P2P search?\
\
It is already implemented and as far as I know it concurrently queries
and mixes results from both the local Solr index, remote DHT and Solr
peers and even OpenSearch hosts\...\
\
To my mind it is one of the aspects that makes YaCy quite unique. It
might appears sometimes inefficient and can certainly be optimized, but
aren\'t performance issues partly due to an undersized p2p network? I
mean in my own YaCy usage, I have the feeling that longer search results
tend to occur when searching rarely indexed terms or when low bandwidth
peers are answering\... With more running peers, can\'t we expect p2p
operations performances to improve?
