the first time, researchers have switched off consciousness by
electrically stimulating a single brain
area.](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329762.700-consciousness-onoff-switch-discovered-deep-in-brain.html?full=true#.U7h4U2K9KK1)

> The woman has epilepsy so the team were using deep brain electrodes to
> record signals from different brain regions to work out where her
> seizures originate. One electrode was positioned next to the
> claustrum, an area that had never been stimulated before.
>
> When the team zapped the area with high frequency electrical impulses,
> the woman lost consciousness. She stopped reading and stared blankly
> into space, she didn\'t respond to auditory or visual commands and her
> breathing slowed. As soon as the stimulation stopped, she immediately
> regained consciousness with no memory of the event.
>
> To confirm that they were affecting the woman\'s consciousness rather
> than just her ability to speak or move, the team asked her to repeat
> the word \"house\" or snap her fingers before the stimulation began.
> If the stimulation was disrupting a brain region responsible for
> movement or language she would have stopped moving or talking almost
> immediately. Instead, she gradually spoke more quietly or moved less
> and less until she drifted into unconsciousness. \[\...\]

> Anil Seth, who studies consciousness at the University of Sussex, UK,
> warns that we have to be cautious when interpreting behaviour from a
> single case study. The woman was missing part of her hippocampus,
> which was removed to treat her epilepsy, so she doesn\'t represent a
> \"normal\" brain, he says.
>
> However, he points out that the interesting thing about this study is
> that the person was still awake. \"Normally when we look at conscious
> states we are looking at awake versus sleep, or coma versus vegetative
> state, or anaesthesia.\" Most of these involve changes of wakefulness
> as well as consciousness but not this time, says Seth. \"So even
> though it\'s a single case study, it\'s potentially quite informative
> about what\'s happening when you selectively modulate consciousness
> alone.\"
