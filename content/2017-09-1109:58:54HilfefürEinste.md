Hello ircamb,\
\
thanks for your idea, but that doesn\'t work for me. The 3 Yacy
instances do have their own indexes in the \"webportal mode\" with many
million urls already indexed.\
As soon as i switch on one instance to the \"intranet mode\" another
index base on this instance is started with 0 urls in it.\
\
Another problem.\
Even in the case i rebuild all indexes on the pcs in the \"intranet
mode\" i do not know how to enter the queries on the dedicated clients
yacy instance in the way that the results of the other 2 yacy instances
are automaitcally queried and displayed together to the client.
