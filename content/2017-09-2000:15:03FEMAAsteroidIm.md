The 13th Hypervelocity Impact
Symposium:](https://www.osti.gov/pages/servlets/purl/1214699)

> The worst case, given the specified uncertainty, would be that the
> approaching object is already fractured and weak enough to explode at
> high altitude. Such an airburst can spread its energy out over a
> larger area and will be more damaging than a crater-forming impact.
> The worst-case scenario would be a high altitude airburst releasing
> about 10.6 Mt of energy. The best estimate would be that the fragment
> is a slightly less dense 50-meter object. Even a relatively strong
> object of this size is likely to explode at high altitude; although it
> is possible some fraction of it could reach the ground and form a
> crater. This best estimate is almost identical to current
> understanding of the Tunguska explosion. \[\...\]
>
> Since the uncertainty in impact location is extensive, we also
> provided a map showing the damage footprint at several locations
> within the ellipse, which we then we convolved with the footprint
> (Figure 3). We advised participants that preliminary evacuation plans
> for an airburst over land should be in a lateral direction into area
> known already to be at no risk, but that detailed plans should wait
> until radar data becomes available (about 6 days before impact)

>
> Much of the uncertainty ellipse spans parts of the Gulf of Mexico. An
> impact within that part of the ellipse would produce a tsunami, and
> would affect the whole of the coastline from Texas to Florida.
> According to calculations by Souheil Ezzedine of Lawrence Livermore
> National Laboratory (LLNL) a tsunami generated by an impact in the
> easternmost part of the ellipse would have wave heights of 3 to 10 m
> and would arrive at the coast over a time spanning from 1 to 4.25
> hours after the impact. The tsunami would first reach the Louisiana
> coastline, causing near total destruction to the barrier islands, The
> wave run-up would extend inland as far as 16 km.
