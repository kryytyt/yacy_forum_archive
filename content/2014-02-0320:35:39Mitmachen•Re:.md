===================================

There is the obvious: beat them on a larger index size. But that is
difficult indeed!!\
\
I would suggest that we could beat them by offering more configuration
options for the power users so they can define how their search engines
work. This is something Google does not give them. Ideally we should
match Google\'s search capabilities and then look to exceed them in this
regard.\
\
A weakness the last time I checked was the inability to do exact
multi-word searches like \"yacy beta\" or \"Orlando, FL\". From reading
from what I recall the nature of the dHt implementation makes this
difficult.\
\
Right now though at this point it\'s probably most important to make
sure the client is stable. Otherwise people will run it and uninstall it
once it always crashes or locks up their system. This was why I left a
few years ago. So far so good on my tests this time. 48 hours uptime so
far.
