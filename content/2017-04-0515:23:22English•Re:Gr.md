Nice to meet you itchigo, I was thinking the same thing. It\'s terrible
when you see a great p2p technology, die due to lack of participation. I
was thinking that one good way to do this would be to get all the
google-blocked urls from those \"chilling effects\" reports and add them
to our indices. Then we could make a sort of \"Here\'s what google is
hiding from you\" pitch. The issue would be making sure that those
results came up the top of a search.
