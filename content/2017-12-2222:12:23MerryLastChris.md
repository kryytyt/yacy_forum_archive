> Among the changes, swastikas are now banned from Twitter. That\'s a
> good move. I applaud it, and it\'s beyond time. However, the
> Confederate flag, a hate symbol that defines one race\'s desire to own
> another race, is still acceptable. Twitter\'s reason is that the
> Confederate flag is historical. But so is the swastika. This decision
> seems less based on principles, but more on a desire to not piss off a
> certain group.
>
> Despite their sanctimonious appeal to \"principles\", Twitter appears
> to be making decisions based on who they\'re afraid to (or can\'t
> afford to) piss off and then backwards engineering the rationale to
> make it palatable. That\'s not principled. That\'s cynical.
>
> The new policy also allows a thinly veiled loophole for Trump:
>
> > This policy does not apply to military or government entities and we
> > will consider exceptions for groups that are currently engaging in
> > (or have engaged in) peaceful resolution.
>
> For all his promises about wanting to reduce the amount of hate and
> violence and harassment on the platform, Jack Dorsey has purposely
> built in a loophole for the biggest perpetrator of all those things.
> That\'s not principled. It\'s cowardly. And it\'s dangerous. \[\...\]
>
> As of this writing, despite Twitter\'s new anti-harassment rules,
> Richard Spencer, Mike Cernovich, Joey Gibson, and David Duke are still
> on the platform. All known fascists. Ta-Nehisi Coates is not. Driven
> off by Richard Spencer\'s harassment. These are the voices we are
> losing because Jack Dorsey has chosen not to act. And it is probably
> too late. That\'s not hyperbolic. Jack has given Donald Trump the fuse
> to light a nuclear war. Jack has given Trump\'s minions the fuse to
> silence the voices America most needs at this moment. And Silicon
> Valley has allowed this to happen because their libertarian allegiance
> doesn\'t extend beyond their own pricks.
