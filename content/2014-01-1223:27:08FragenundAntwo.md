====================================================

Hi krzyszp,\
The usage of BOINC is a very good idea in principle, but there is a
difference in between what BOINC is (as far as I know) an what YaCy
does: BOINC is distributed computation and YaCy is about distributed
storage. From your post I learn that BOINC has storage limitations for
their projects? If yes, then we would need to plan what is the right way
to handle that situation, it would be very similar to the YaCyPi project
where there is just limited space on a SD card.\
\
The other problem you address is the port forwarding task the user has
to do. We have a uPNP component in YaCy but I believe in most cases it
does not work. There should be a development team around that problem to
solve it: is there anybody who has experience with uPNP?
