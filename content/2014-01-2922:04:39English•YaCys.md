English â€¢ YaCy setup on a Raspberry PI
======================================

Date: 2014-01-29 22:04:39

I am trying to set up YaCy on a Raspberry PI model B rev. 1 (256MB).\
I have been following the instructions given here:-\
[http://www.yacy-websuche.de/wiki/index. \...
spberry\_Pi](http://www.yacy-websuche.de/wiki/index.php/En:Raspberry_Pi){.postlink}\
I also followed the instructions given here:-\
[http://www.yacy-websuche.de/wiki/index. \...
anHeadless](http://www.yacy-websuche.de/wiki/index.php/En:DebianHeadless){.postlink}\
However I installed openjdk-6-jre-headless from the Debian repo\'s.\
I have NOT setup YaCy Auto-Start and Watchdog!\
I have NOT edited the file /etc/rc.local to add the iptables command
line.\
I have installed ufw; and edited the /etc/ufw/before.rules to include:-\
\*nat\
:PREROUTING ACCEPT \[0:0\]\
-A PREROUTING -p tcp \--dport 80 -j REDIRECT \--to-port 8090\
COMMIT\
\
ufw status:-\
Status: active\
Logging: on (low)\
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing)\
New profiles: skip\
\
To Action From\
\-- \-\-\-\-\-- \-\-\--\
8090/tcp ALLOW IN Anywhere\
22/tcp LIMIT IN Anywhere\
\
I hope I have setup my Netgear WGR614v10 router to open ports 80 and
8090 to my Raspberry PI at IP address 192.168.1.70.\
With my browser I have entered <http://192.168.1.70:8090> and I am able
to see the yacysearch.html, when I look at the ConfigBasic.html I see
the following message:-\
\
[ Your peer cannot be reached from outside (which is not fatal, but
would be good for the YaCy network); please open your firewall for this
port and/or set a virtual server option in your router to allow
connections on this port.]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
\
So how do I fix the above message?\
\
Also, when I look at the Status.html page I see the following message:-\
\
[You have not published your peer seed yet. This happens automatically,
just wait.]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
\
No matter how long I wait this message does not go away, so what is the
fix for this as well.
