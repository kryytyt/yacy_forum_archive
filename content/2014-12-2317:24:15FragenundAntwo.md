Now the tool responds \"No valid YaCy-Peer found: "HTTP-Error : invalid
HTTP-Response-Code 403, Code 200 is expected".\" which I see as
significant improvement, thanks!\

That\'s a pity. Feel free to link this forum thread in the discussion
you referenced and share the test results. Feel free to repeat the tests
you conducted with my domain name, again, in order to fix this issue.\

After reading the thread, I deactivated the remote proxy which I set up
to point to a transparent squid3 instance running on the same machine,
and guess what - the issue is fixed, i.e. my yacy peer reachable from
the outside and working in the peer-to-peer network. Unfortunately, that
doesn\'t allow me to set up a proxy.\

Thanks a lot for your help!!\
