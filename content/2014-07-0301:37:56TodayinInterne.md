> Facebook\'s \"Experimental evidence\" hypothesis amounted to \"let\'s
> see if we can plant unhappiness and make it spread.\" The hypothesis
> was tested on a large group of people \-- and their networks \-- that
> couldn\'t consent to the experiment, and had no way to actually track
> whatever impact it had on people\'s lives.
>
> Facebook, once again, did what it\'s good at: tracking us, failing to
> get consent, and avoiding accountability.

> Adam Kramer \-- who worked on both studies \-- posted a non-apology to
> Facebook that utterly missed the point, saying they were sorry about
> the way they had described the experiment while attempting to re-frame
> the concept of user consent as if it were a formality.

> of emotional tampering in people\'s day-to-day lives was simply a
> misunderstanding that only anxious people worried about.
