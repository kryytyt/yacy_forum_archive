Beginning next month, California law will require that cars stay at
least three feet away from cyclists when passing on the
roads.](http://www.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2014/08/22/sf-weekly-tests-new-state-law-requiring-cars-to-give-cyclists-more-room-on-the-roads)

*So he\'s saying \"I felt safer\" but he\'s also saying \"I was in the
door zone the whole time\".*

*The only way to have 3\' on the left and no door-zone on the right is
to take the entire lane all the time.*

> The embarrassment I felt while cruising around the city with a stick

*The same effect could probably be observed by biking while wearing a
clown suit.*
