> The FCC Internet Porn Scrambler Plug-in is the simplest way to see
> what the Internet will look like without Net Neutrality. Because
> without federal protections in place, the internet will start to look
> a lot like it did the last time the cable companies had control of our
> content. The plug-in is easy to install, but hard to stomach as all of
> your favorite content will be instantaneously replaced on sites like
> Pornhub with unwatchable scrambled video.

*It only works in Chrome, but I did some testing for you. It looks just

noises and stuff.*
