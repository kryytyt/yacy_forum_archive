> So Twitter now wants a sky bridge connecting two office buildings,
> just to make sure that the workers never have to set foot out of the
> building or see anyone else. It\'s importing the idea of the suburban
> \"campus,\" where everything is self-contained and nobody leaves (for
> lunch or anything else) to an urban setting.

> Didn\'t we give Twitter a tax break in part so that all of those

> study by the city\'s economist, Ted Egan, shows that taxable sales
> (retail, restaurant etc.) in the tax-break area grew more slowly than
> other parts of the city \-- suggesting that the tax break may have
> been great for Twitter but no so much for local small businesses.
