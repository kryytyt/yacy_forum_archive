Hi luc,\
\
thanks for the explanation, I tried all 3 suggestions but to not much
avail.\
\
I was able though to index the data folder by pointing the crawler to
the cache via file:///, which gave me pretty good results of searching
for words or content i knew i came across while surfing zeronet, but
then the generated links are not of so much use, as they point to the
place in my cache file structure\...\
\
So is there any way or idea how to index dynamically loading content via
javascript?\
\
Or how to restore useful link structure out of the cache (which always
is a full copy of a visited site as far as I understand zeronet)?\
\
Greetings, Clemens.
