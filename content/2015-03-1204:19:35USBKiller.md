> The basic idea of the USB drive is quite simple. When we connect it up
> to the USB port, an inverting DC/DC converter runs and charges
> capacitors to -110V. When the voltage is reached, the DC/DC is
> switched off. At the same time, the filed transistor opens. It is used
> to apply the -110V to signal lines of the USB interface. When the
> voltage on capacitors increases to -7V, the transistor closes and the
> DC/DC starts. The loop runs till everything possible is broken down.
