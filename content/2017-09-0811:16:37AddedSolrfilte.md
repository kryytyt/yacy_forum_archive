Added Solr filter queries for audio, video and application domains

Inspired from the existing one used on image search, and consistent with
post filtering on content domain applied in SearchEvent.addNodes().

These filters are quite simplistic but at least audio, video or
application search now return results. Previously, when filtering on
these content domains, many results pages (and often even the first
page) were empty while the total results count suggested that results
should be available. This was because filtering on domain was only
applied AFTER requesting Solr indexes.
