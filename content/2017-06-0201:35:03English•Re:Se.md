Hello, as far as I know the two search options you are looking for are
indeed not available in the main YaCy search interface.\
\
But if you are not afraid by Solr query syntax, you can already go far
further in search customization by requesting directly your own local
Solr index with your own queries (unfortunately this does not apply to
p2p search).\
\
For example to not have successive results on the same host, maybe [Solr
Result
grouping](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Result+Grouping){.postlink}
could help you. This could be a request like

Code: 
:   `/solr/select?core=collection1&q=yacy&start=0&rows=10&fl=sku&group=true&group.field=host_s&group.main=true`

: search term is yacy, with maximum 10 results from start, displaying
only urls (for simplicity in the example) and grouping by host name.\
\
This is just an example. I am really not an expert in Solr queries, and
of course this is not user friendly. But by crafting your own search
queries eventually rendered by your own HTML search page, you can obtain
a very specific and personal result.
