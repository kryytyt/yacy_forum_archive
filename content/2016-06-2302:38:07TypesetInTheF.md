The font-nerdery in this is truly excellent, and I enjoyed the
deconstruction of the errors in the replicant serial numbers, but it\'s
when he tears apart the ESPER that it really shines:

> This chunky-looking gadget is a voice-controlled photographic enhancer

> Deckard continues to direct the ESPER to navigate around his blurry,

Also, [BR9732](http://www.br9732.com/) is a truly ridiculous 3D model of
Decard\'s apartment:
