> So the fact is that our experience of the world will increasingly come

> programs they\'ve never installed doing unknown things to which
> they\'ve never agreed to benefit companies they\'ve never heard of,
> inefficiently at best and actively malignant at worst (but how would
> you know?), cars, street lights, and even buildings will behave in the
> same vaguely suspicious way. Is your self-driving car deliberately
> slowing down to give priority to the higher-priced models? Is your
> green A/C really less efficient with a thermostat from a different
> company, or it\'s just not trying as hard? And your tv is supposed to
> only use its camera to follow your gestural commands, but it\'s a bit
> suspicious how it always offers Disney downloads when your children
> are sitting in front of it.
