YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Automated YaCy Docker image
========================================================

Date: 2016-05-14 10:18:30

Hi, I made last days some experiments using docker to deploy YaCy. I
found it quite interesting as an alternative to full virtual machines :
it offers complete isolation but is lightweight and image building can
be easily shared and automated.\
Don\'t you think it would be interesting to include a Dockerfile in main
yacy git repository? It would allow a docker image up-to-date with
latest commits to be automatically generated, on Docker Hub or on
another Docker repository.\
There were already 3 existing yacy docker files on Docker Hub, but they
reference older YaCy versions or are not targetting automated build from
latest sources.\
\
I propose you a version based on Debian here :
[https://github.com/luccioman/yacy\_searc \...
ker/docker](https://github.com/luccioman/yacy_search_server/tree/docker/docker){.postlink}.\
And the automated docker image :
<https://hub.docker.com/r/luccioman/yacy/>
