avoid File.deleteOnExit() on temp files
JVM registers each file in a list regardless of already deleted and never
cleans up the list during runtime.
This accumulates to a considerable amount of mem during large crawls and/or
long uptime.
To tackle this, all temp files are now created in a subdir of java.io.tmpdir 
and the jvm tmpdir property is set to this subdir, which is deleted by
code on shutdown.
Additionally let pdfParser use this tmp subdir too.
