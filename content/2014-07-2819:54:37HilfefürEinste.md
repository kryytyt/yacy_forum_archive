Hilfe für Einsteiger und Anwender • Is the free world really shrinking?

Well, actually, what I mean is if Yacy\'s freeworld network is
shrinking.\
\
After continuously monitoring my Yacy instance for two months, I noticed
a significant decrease in the number of peers connected to the freeworld
network, as shown in the graphs below.\

\
and a detailed view from active peers (which I understand are peers
running on senior mode)\

\
Is this only a seasonal behaviour, like people going out on holiday and
shutting their Yacy peers down, or is the freeworld network really
loosing strength?\
\
Any thoughts about this are welcome.
