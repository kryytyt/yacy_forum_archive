Hello, sorry to answer in English. But I wanted to say domain name (or
website host name) search is also a feature I think is missing in YaCy.
If someone knows how to configure a peer to perform this kind of query I
would be interested.\
By the way I believe indexed data and Solr already have everything we
would technically need, but a smart enough query still has to be
implemented.\
To mind my it should not be proposed as default in Text search, but
rather as a distinct new UI, for example \"Domain search\" or \"Website
search\".
