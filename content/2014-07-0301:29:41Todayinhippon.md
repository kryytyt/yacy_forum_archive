> Valderrama, whose job until recently included watching over the hippos
> in the Magdalena, has seen animals up to 155 miles away from Hacienda
> Napoles. Fishermen are terrified of the three-tonne herbivores, he
> says. At night, the animals roam the countryside, wandering into
> ranches, eating crops and occasionally crushing small cows.
>
> Colombian people, he believes, are more vulnerable than Africans
> because they see hippos as cuddly, \"floppy\" animals. The respected
> El Colombiano newspaper recently reported that children in a school
> near Hacienda Napoles are sharing a pond with the animals, and having
> direct contact with hippo calves at home. \[\...\]
>
> Hildebrand has another, more radical solution: \"I think they should
> barbecue them and eat them.\" The animal is said to have tasted
> similar to pork.
>
> Valderrama doesn\'t recommend eating the meat, in case it is infected
> with a transmittable disease - one dead hippo was found to be carrying
> leptospirosis which can cause meningitis - but he does see the
> complete elimination of male hippos as the most practical solution.
>
> This was also the view of international experts from the World
> Wildlife Fund and the Disney Foundation, who visited Colombia in 2010
> - they described the hippo situation as a \"time bomb\". But Echeverri
> can see how this story would play internationally, and wants to avoid
> it.
