Thanks for your comments & suggestions.\
I will find those logs\... Thanks\
Well, the background is \'welcome to the world of big cloud providers
always blaming the other guy\' \...especially when there is a hint of
developer work going on! = The \"perfect excuse.\"\
We will try your tricks. Thanks.\
By the way\... Lack of space has been the recent problem for creating
backups\...+ not everyone has gargantuan institutional backbones for
flinging around multi-GB folders in less than lightyears\... and with
now substantial sized data folders, this is not a funny problem.

So, back to the Basic Question please:\
FINDING The [[Best
Practices]{style="font-weight: bold"}]{style="text-decoration: underline"}
based work around, patch or rollback\...\
\
How is it that this lack of displaying the search results in a standard
off the shelf window - using one of the display pages provided, and
several html pages of errors inside admin (which does display) results
in no search results being shown to searchers (only the top of page
framework) and how is that our fault on -2- simultaneous separate,
not-interconnected, cloud servers - each in in Robinson mode that got
the same \~very slightly\~ flaky update within minutes of each other
(that clearly doesn\'t \'work\' everywhere)?\
So at least [[in
clouds]{style="font-style: italic"}]{style="font-weight: bold"} with
this version of Ubuntu, this was a [\"repeatable
failure.\"]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
Call this a dumb sincere question, please?\
We\'re not angry, just needing seasoned creative help to get past what
clearly is \"un petit bete noire,\" as the French say.\
This is all work in development, on all sides, and it takes inter-team
creativity, across & between different teams.\
Time to think
![:arrow:](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif "Arrow")
past the error state, please\...\
Many thanks!\
