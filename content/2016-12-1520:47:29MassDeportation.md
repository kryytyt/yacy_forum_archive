as funny now, is it?

If this all sounds familiar, it\'s because it ***IS VERY FUCKING
FAMILIAR:***

[Facebook Spokesperson Calls Muslim Registry \"Straw

\"Facebook never would have taken the Lord\'s name in vain had they
known the mic was live.\"

But if you think that Facebook is not *already* a Muslim registry, you
have really not been paying attention:

> Facebook, of course, already asks for and retains sensitive
> information about the race, religion, and location of its users and
> allows advertisers to target narrow segments of people based on that
> personal information. Government officials here and abroad already use
> the social network to track activists and dissidents.

\"We would never create a registry\" sounds a little less convincing
when phrased as \"we would *never* run that particular SQL query on our
existing database\", doesn\'t it?
