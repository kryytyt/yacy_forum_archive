> Earlier this year, Verizon was roundly criticized and sued for using
> \"super cookies\" that tracked its customers around the internet for
> advertising purposes regardless of whether or not they had deleted
> standard tracking cookies. So, naturally, it\'s making the trackers
> stronger and more persistent than ever. \[\...\]
>
> Earlier this year, Verizon paid \$4.4 billion for AOL and all the
> companies it owns, including The Huffington Post, TechCrunch, and
> Engadget. That takeover was incredibly important because AOL does most
> of its business these days as an advertising company.
>
> AOL\'s advertising network serves ads on roughly 40 percent of the
> web, according to ProPublica. Verizon knows its customers\' home
> addresses, the type of cell phones they own, the number of people on a
> given phone plan, and customer financial information. That information
> can be used by AOL and Verizon to target you much more carefully,
> which equals better (more expensive) ads.
>
> > \"The Relevant Mobile Advertising program uses your postal and email
> > addresses, certain information about your Verizon products and
> > services (such as device type), and information we obtain from other
> > companies (such as gender, age range, and interests). The separate
> > Verizon Selects program uses this same information plus additional
> > information about your use of Verizon services including mobile Web
> > browsing, app and feature usage and location of your device. The AOL
> > Advertising Network uses information collected when you use AOL
> > services and visit third-party websites where AOL provides
> > advertising services (such as Web browsing, app usage, and
> > location), as well as information that AOL obtains from third-party
> > partners and advertisers.\"
