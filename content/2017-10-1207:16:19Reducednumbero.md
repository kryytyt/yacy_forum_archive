Reduced number of search navigators refresh requests in JS resort mode

The SearchEvent listen to changes on each of its navigators, and the
information about their overall state is sent with each fetched search
item (as a "data-nav-generation" attribute). Then the browser can
regularly fetch a fresh version of yacysearchtrailer.html only if
necessary (when that nav-generation value change).
