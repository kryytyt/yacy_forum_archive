Hi,\
\
There are two ways to do this: (1) using the YaCy HTTP proxy, or (2)
using
[YaCyIndexerGreasemonkey](https://github.com/JeremyRand/YaCyIndexerGreasemonkey){.postlink}.
The proxy doesn\'t need any extra software, you just need to set your
browser to use a proxy server. However, the proxy can\'t index pages
that have cookies or use HTTPS, and its crawldepth is always 0.
YaCyIndexerGreasemonkey requires a browser or browser extension that can
run user scripts (e.g. Greasemonkey on Firefox), but it supports pages
with cookies or HTTPS, and you can customize the crawldepth.\

Hope this helps.
