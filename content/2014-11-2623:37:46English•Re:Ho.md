English â€¢ Re: How to get YACY working as a proxy
================================================

Date: 2014-11-26 23:37:46

If our admin & user pages are not visible in our cloud installation
because of this message\

> <div>
>
> \
> HTTP ERROR: 403\
> \
> Problem accessing /. Reason:\
> \
> proxy use not allowed (see Advanced Settings -\> HTTP Networking -\>
> Transparent Proxy; switched off).\
> Powered by Jetty://\
>
> </div>

\
What file do we change and what is required and where is it please?\
\
We moved the DATA folder from the installation, in Ubuntu used sudo
apt-get remove yacy and then reinstalled it with sudo apt-get install
yacy\
and yet the same message reappears in the new install.\
What is wrong and how to fix it manually please?\
Many thanks!
