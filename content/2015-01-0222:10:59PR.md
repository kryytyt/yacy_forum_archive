Week:](http://www.newsweek.com/2014/09/26/i-replied-every-pr-email-i-received-week-268871.html)

> At one point I get an email about USA Insulation \-- \"the country\'s
> largest retrofit insulation company\" \-- opening a location in
> Rockland County, so I reply by telling the publicist that my parents
> live near Rockland County and that I\'ll give them a heads up, and I
> feel bad not following through on this promise, so I forward the
> announcement to my parents and my mom just replies, \"Why?\" That\'s
> it, that\'s her entire email, which is probably how I should have
> replied to the publicist in the first place. The publicist writes back
> and lets me know that USA Insulation \"covers a 60-mile radius\" and
> is \"really a top-notch insulation business,\" but I don\'t share
> these additional details with my mom.
