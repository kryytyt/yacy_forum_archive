\@mattdpearce: first thing I thought of was that Danish inventor guy and
his [private murder
submarine](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2017/08/crowdfunded-murder-submarine/).

\@Vinncent: Thinking everyone is a serial killer is a very normal thing
to do, rather than serial killer behavior. hey I\'m just asking
questions

\@alexnpress: in musk\'s defense, if I\'d spent years of my life working
with peter thiel, I\'d probably think there were a lot more serial
killers in the world than there actually are

\@nandelabra: There\'s really no way to prove that neither he nor Peter
Thiel are in fact not low-rent Patrick Batemans.

\@YePirateLiberal: I will eat my own hat if \@elonmusk has ever ridden
San Francisco\'s (efficient, if shabby) BART train or (quaintly
adequate) Muni trolley as anything but a publicity stunt to \"prove how
terrible they are\".

\@collumbo: In fairness getting public transport to / from your hollowed
out volcano can be a challenge

\@MyDickerson: Have you considered that you don\'t hate public transit,
you just hate the poor? This is so removed from the actual experience of
riding the bus. You are a misanthrope.

\@brandcoachkelly: Serial killers don\'t drive? I mean it seems that
would be a better way to get away with the crime, but ok!
