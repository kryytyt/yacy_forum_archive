Renamed Chinese & Greek lng files using ISO639-1 codes.

Previously named with their ISO 3166-1 country code : this way, when
setting language to "Browser" in ConfigBasic.html, it didn't work
properly when browser preferred language was Chinese or Greek as their
respective language codes are "zh" and "el" (not "cn" and "gr" which are
their country codes)
