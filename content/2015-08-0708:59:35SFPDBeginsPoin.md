say I need to get from downtown to Golden Gate Park by bike this
weekend. What\'s my best route that avoids the Wiggle and the Panhandle
and Captain Douchenozzle\'s pointless stake-out? (That isn\'t, you know,
a 30Â° angle.)

Second question: where\'s the most effective place I can spend money in
order to get this jackass reassigned?

> SFPD Park Station Captain John Sanford has made good on his promise:
> Officers were out this morning ticketing bike commuters who failed to
> comply with a strict application of the stop sign law on Page Street
> and the Wiggle. One bike rider said police justified her ticket by
> adding their own fictional flourish to the law.
>
> Laura Kiniry, 41, said she canceled a doctor appointment she was
> biking to after receiving a \$234 ticket (plus court fees) because she
> didn\'t put her foot down after climbing uphill on Central Street to
> make a left onto Page.
>
> Kiniry, who has biked in the city for 18 years, said she saw two
> people on bikes already pulled over by police at Page and Baker. She
> assumed she wouldn\'t receive a traffic citation for making a safe,
> practical near-stop after pedaling uphill at single-digit speeds.
>
> \"Maybe I didn\'t come to a complete stop. I looked both ways,\" said
> Kiniry. She said the officer told her, \"\'You have to have at least
> one of your feet down.\'\" That supposed requirement appears nowhere
> in the California Vehicle Code. \[\...\]
>
> In an email exchange shared with Streetsblog, Inner Sunset resident
> Sean Rea told Park Captain Sanford that he is \"willfully disregarding
> statistical evidence that proves the majority of injury accidents are
> caused by motorists \-- not by pedestrians or cyclists.\"
>
> Sanford has said the bike crackdown is a response to complaints rather
> than data. So Rea wrote multiple emails to report run-ins he\'d had
> with reckless drivers while bicycling. Here\'s one example:
>
> > Twice this week I was cut off by drivers who failed to yield to me.
> > In both cases, \[an\] SFPD patrol car was behind me and had complete
> > visibility of the situation. I was able to talk to each patrol car
> > at the next red light and when I asked why they didn\'t cite the
> > driver, both said something to the extent of \"well, you\'re OK,
> > right?\".
> >
> > This seems like a stark double standard to me. Drivers can put me at
> > risk but as long as they don\'t hurt me they won\'t get cited. Yet
> > when cyclists make small infractions that don\'t result in injury
> > the response from you is a crackdown.
