I aborted the install process (Closed the cmd line window and purged
Javaw process).\
Then I shut dwon my Firewall (Commodo).\
I restarted Yacy and I confirmed that the upgrade didn\'t work, since
the system version number wasn\'t changed.\
Then I selected Install Release from Manual System Update section and
what I got was this two messages:\

\
and\

\
Again, it seems that the install procedure was in an infinite loop.\
Again, I canceled the cmd line window and purged the Javaw process.\
Then I restarted Yacy and this time I choose Automated System Update,
like you\'ve said before.\
This time, nothing seem to happen and, by the end, I\'m still running
1.04/9000 version.\
As far as my Linux knowledge goes, tar.gz seems to be a Linux file. Does
this has something to do with my inabbility to upgrade Yacy on Windows
Vista?
