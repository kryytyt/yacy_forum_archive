> It was attempted to use planetary gears to realize the mechanical
> implementation of postural synergies since it might provide better
> accuracy than differential pulleys and might be easier to fabricate
> than designing a differential hydraulic system. Then the synergy
> outputs will be rotations (instead of being translations as in the
> other two options). The most direct way to connect these synergy
> outputs to the finger joint axes is to use flexible shafts. What\'s
> more, rotations of these flexible axes would not be affected by a
> possible presence of wrist motions. Using worm gears and gears,
> rotations of these flexible shafts drive all the finger joints.
