Hello promocore, I hope an answer in English is better than nothing.\
Indeed the MediaWiki Dump Import works but the user interface is a
currently bit confusing/buggy. To make it work, you must either :\
- put the dump file in your YaCy server install folder and then choose
it with the browser upload field : only works if your YaCy server is
running on the same computer as your browser\
- OR call directly the url this way :

Code: 
:   `http://peerhost:8090/IndexImportMediawiki_p.html?file=file:///absolute/server/path/to/yourdump.xml.bz2`

(the importmediawiki.sh script runs this way)\
\
In both cases, the dump file has to be on the same computer as the YaCy
peer.\
\
One last confusing thing : the browser then regularly refreshes the
/IndexImportMediawiki\_p.html page, showing the progress, but never
clearly indicates when the task is terminated (at least on my last
import test).\
\
It also bothered me last time I used this feature. I will try to find
some time to improve these points.\
\
Have a nice day
