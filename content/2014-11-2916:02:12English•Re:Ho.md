Ah, thank you! You are most kind to explain this.\
Apparently, I am not alone - though it provides little comfort when
neither the admin nor the user end displays.\

Please regarding to your comment\

\
could you please tell me the name of the file, where it is, and the line
or reference and what to change it to to reverse the problem?\
You wil remember that the error message is as follows\

> <div>
>
> \
> Problem accessing /Status.html. Reason:\
> \
> proxy use not allowed (see Advanced Settings -\> HTTP Networking -\>
> Transparent Proxy; switched off).\

\
hence we need to opposite condition - which I hope will \'cure\' the
problem.\
Thanks for your generous and kind help & advice!
