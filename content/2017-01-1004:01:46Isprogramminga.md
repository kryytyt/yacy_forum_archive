Is programming an Arduino from MacOS always a nightmarish clusterfuck, or am I just lucky?

spend like 95% of my time wondering why the god damned serial port
isn\'t working.

Of late, it goes like this:

-   Upload the code.
-   Unplug the [FTDI](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/9115)
    from the [Arduino Ethernet](https://www.adafruit.com/products/418)
    and change something.
-   Plug it back in.
-   FFS, where did `/dev/cu.usbserial-WTFBBQ` go?
-   Yup. It\'s gone.
-   Power cycle my USB hub.
-   Oh great, now my Mac\'s *entire USB stack* has gone away and now I
    don\'t even have a mouse or keyboard.
-   Hold down the power button and reboot.

Unplugging the FTDI doesn\'t *always* make /dev/cu go away, just like
nine times out of ten. But as soon as that happens, I\'m within minutes
of needing to hold down the power button.

To whom do I address my hate? The authors of the comically horrible
Arduino IDE app? I\'m gonna guess, \"yes, there\" because the fucking
thing is written in *Java* and anyone who made *that* decision any later
than 1997 clearly can\'t be trusted to find their own ass in the dark
with both hands. But I would certainly entertain the idea that this is
all Apple\'s fault somehow. Maybe they\'ve assigned maintenance of their
USB stack to some intern who sees it as a great learning experience.

But, holy crap, do people really *put up with this?* Or am I just lucky?
Or doing something wrong?

Is someone going to say, \"You just *unplugged* it? You can\'t just
*unplug* it, USB isn\'t hot-swappable! Chickens must be bled first!\"
Ok, but I didn\'t read anything in the manual about these chickens, tell
me more.
