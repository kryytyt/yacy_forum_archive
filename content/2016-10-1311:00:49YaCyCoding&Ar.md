As I suspected, some specific URLs are really long to process against
YaCy BlackList patterns. After modifying my peer to trace long
processing times in BlackList.isListed(), I found some examples :\
- [http://molodezhnaja.ch/../../../../../. \...
ndyman.htm](http://molodezhnaja.ch/../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../handyman.htm){.postlink}
is processed in about 15 seconds\
- [http://molodezhnaja.ch/../../../../../. \...
bambi2.jpg](http://molodezhnaja.ch/../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../film/bambi2.jpg){.postlink}
is first processed in about 60 seconds, and then this time increase to
several minutes the next times it is encountered.\
\
So I think there is definitely something that can be done, maybe fixing
the URL normalizing method for this kind of path, I will try to see what
is the most appropriate.
