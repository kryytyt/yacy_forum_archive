English â€¢ Re: STARTUP YaCy cannot start: String index out of range: -1

this is a strange bug which may appear if you crawl a very large number
of different hosts and something gets messed up in your file system.\
I made a patch in YaCy 1.73.9216 which should prevent that YaCy stops
working but also puts out an error message in your log at
DATA/LOG/yacy00.log.\
\
Please watch out for the message \"hostPath name must contain a dot\" in
that log file and please post the message here so I can continue with a
better bugfix. However, this version should nevertheless fully work (I
hope so).
