Enforced access controls on some administrative actions.

 - ensure use of HTTP POST method : HTTP GET should only be used for
information retrieval and not to perform server side effect operations
(see HTTP standard https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.1)
 - a transaction token is now required for these administrative form
submissions to ensure the request can not be included in an external
site and performed silently/by mistake by the user browser
```
