hm, the sentence \"The DHT-rules do not work without this function\" is
maybe misleading and actually not very specific. Well, the DHT traffic
has two sides: a sender and a receiver, and this is where you may decide
if you want to contibute as sender and/or receiver. It is totally
acceptable that peer owner switch off one or both of these sides (on
their side) and if the switch off both, they become a so-called
\'robinson peer\', but stays in the network. Even robinson peers can be
searched by other peer. In your case you would just switch of the
receiver part and therefore that would leave an \'acceptable gap\' in
the DHT because sending peers would just turn to the next \'redundant\'
peers (we have a three-fold redundancy). That means: switching off your
DHT-in will not harm the network, but it will also remove your ability
to search in the p2p network because that is also an incoming of indexes
from other peers.
