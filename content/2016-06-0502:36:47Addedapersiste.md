``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
Added a persistency attribute to credential and identity which is a flag
to distinguish if such an object shall be stored persistently.
Added also a new class which can store json objects either in a
persistent way or volatile in a cache.
Finally connected bot new features together to either persistently or
volatile credentials or identities.
