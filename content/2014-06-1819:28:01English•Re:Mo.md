The graphs above are now turned public at <http://cactibr.noip.me/cacti>
(guest/guest for user/passwd)\

You may want to click on the Thumbnails checkbox to get a broader view,
or click on \"Servidor\" (on the left vertical panel) to see the
performance graphs of the linux server where Yacy is running.\
\
You can also click on any graph to have a detailed view of each of them.
