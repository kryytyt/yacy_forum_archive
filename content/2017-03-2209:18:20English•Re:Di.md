Hi Mario, to my mind using a symbolic link to move your YaCy data folder
is a safe option, furthermore if you consider that on Debian the DATA
folder is already distributed as a symbolic link between
/usr/share/yacy/DATA and /var/lib/yacy.\
\
I just checked on a Debian YaCy peer that the following steps works
properly :\
- stop the YaCy peer\
- copy the data folder and important, keep ownership to yacy user (-p
option) : cp -Rp /var/lib/yacy /newPart/newFolder\
- rename the existing data folder to keep it as backup : mv
/var/lib/yacy /var/lib/yacy.back\
- make a new symbolic link to your new data folder : ln -s
/newPart/newFolder /var/lib/yacy\
- links chain to the data folder should now be : /usr/share/yacy/DATA
-\> /var/lib/yacy -\> /newPart/newFolder\
- start your peer : you should find your settings and indexed data
unchanged. Hopefully the new partition freed disk space is also
successfully taken into account : this step worked for me on Debian.\
\
Good luck
