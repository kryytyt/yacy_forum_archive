Hi, I have the same problem, has anybody found a solution yet? I have
installed YaCy as per the instructions, but when I click on the app icon
it loads briefly in the sidebar dock before disappearing. When I try to
access through <http://localhost:8090/index.html> it gives a server not
found error.\
\
I run OS 10.9.5 and latest Java and have added
\"http://localhost:8090/index.html\" in site exception list.\
\
Any help will be appreciated, I am very keen to try YaCy!
