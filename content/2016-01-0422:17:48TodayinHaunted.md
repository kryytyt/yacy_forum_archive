> The uterus is a place protected from the exterior, and it is the
> mother\'s body that carries out this protecting role through multiple
> layers of soft tissue. These attenuate the intensity of sound and
> distort it in its journey to the uterus; it\'s similar to what happens
> when you hear a conversation in the next-door room without catching
> everything that is said.
>
> Can babies perceive sounds like we do? This is solely possible via the
> vagina.
>
> The vagina is a closed space, so sound is not dispersed in the
> environment. In addition, there are less soft tissue layers separating
> the baby from the sound target, only the vaginal and uterine walls. By
> placing a speaker inside the vagina, we overcome the barrier formed by
> the abdominal wall and the baby can hear sounds with almost as much
> intensity and clarity as when emitted.
>
> With Babypod, sounds reach the baby without distortion, almost as
> intense and clear as when emitted, as the number of layers that
> separate the baby from the sound target is lower.
