Hi,\
<http://canyouseeme.org/> says that the port is reachable.
<http://yacy.info/tool_test> says \"No valid YaCy-Peer found.\" without
any explanation why there\'s no valid peer, links to what a valid peer
is, etc. I was already running a yacy instance with the same
DynDNS-Setup (BTW, I\'m using DynDNS\...) I have now, but between some
unknown versions it stopped working. How to find out what a valid peer
is (after both the testing site and the yacy frontend don\'t reveal
that) and the wiki contains a lot of blank pages which make search too
annoying to lead to a result)?
