> \"Tonight we sent Oderus home in a fitting manner at the public
> memorial for Dave Brockie. A blazing Viking ship with Oderus laid out
> in it, the cuttlefish pointing proudly straight up.
>
> \"Watching my friend Dave\'s costume go up in flames in front of a
> thousand fans was so much more intense for me than the private
> memorial for friends and family we had April Fool\'s Day.
>
> \"I spoke at both of them, as GWAR asked me to, and both times as I
> spoke I was sad. But watching his alter ego burn tore me up way more
> than the first memorial, maybe because there was Dave, the human who
> was my friend who just \'left us\' \-- I never saw his body \-- and
> then there was Oderus, who was something entirely else. To watch his
> stage gear burn was like watching part of my life literally go up in
> flames.
