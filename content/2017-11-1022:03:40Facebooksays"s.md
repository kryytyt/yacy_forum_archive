[The naked truth about Facebook\'s revenge porn
tool:](https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/10/the-naked-truth-about-facebook-s-revenge-porn-tool/)

> Facebook has announced it\'s trialling a tool in Australia to fight
> revenge porn on its platform, one that requires victims to send the
> company a copy of the violating images. Amazingly, this is true, and
> not a *Clickhole* story. It\'s the kind of thing that makes you wonder
> if there are human people at Facebook, and do they even understand
> what words mean? Because as we unravel the details of this tool \--
> totally not conceived by actual robots or a company with a zero
> percent trust rating among users \-- we realize it\'s a very confusing
> tool indeed. \[\...\]
>
> This apparently sends a copy of the image to the probable-Cybermen
> behind the scenes at Facebook, who momentarily pause from massaging
> advertisers with whale tears, laughing at people worried about
> [Holocaust
> denial](https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/26/the-facebook-president-and-zucks-racist-rulebook/),
> [high-fiving](https://www.gq.com/story/virtual-zuckerberg-puerto-rico)
> over scenes of unbelievable human devastation, and [destroying
> democracy](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/07/politics/warner-facebook-russia-hacking/).
>
> Then a person, and totally not a heartless tech bro, who works for
> Facebook looks at it. They decide if it is revenge porn, or if on that
> day you are just shit out of luck for getting your nonconsensual nudes
> removed.
>
> At some point, according to what Facebook told Motherboard, the image
> has portions of it blurred out. This may happen with magic grey alien
> technology in transit, somehow preserving the privacy and dignity of
> the revenge porn victim. Maybe the employee just blurs their eyes over
> the sensitive parts by squinting really hard or rubbing their eyelids.
> Perhaps a superhacker Facebook cyber-script blurs the private bits so
> quickly you can feel a breeze come off the Facebook employee\'s
> computer.
>
> But probably not. A Facebook spokesperson
> [told](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3d5gx/real-humans-will-review-the-nudes-you-send-facebook-as-part-of-its-anti-revenge-porn-program)
> Motherboard that when the image is blurry, a highly specialized and
> incredibly trained team are the only people who have access to it for
> a few days. It is my personal hope that their training is in martial
> arts. \[\...\]
>
> Anyway. As best we know, after employees look at the photo (and it may
> or may not be altered for the privacy and dignity of its subject),
> Facebook\'s machines take over. Facebook makes a hash of the photo and
> stores it in a repository that\'s cross-checked against photo uploads
> on the service.
