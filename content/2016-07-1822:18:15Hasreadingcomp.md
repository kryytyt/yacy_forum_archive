Has reading comprehension gone down? The answer may surprise you.

This is a public service announcement:

1.  \"16% of the group\" means \"my *just-so* story has no actual
    support from the study\".
2.  Especially if that number only appears in the final paragraph.
3.  \"Design concept\" means \"I have created nothing except a pretty
    picture in Photoshop\".
4.  The phrase \"Although the project is currently conceptual\"
    appearing a dozen paragraphs in means \"the so-called reporter is
    intentionally trying to deceive you\".
5.  \"Filed a patent\" means \"this article is a press release\". (It
    also means \"our patent system is a joke.\")
6.  If the headline asks a question, the answer is NO. (If the answer
    was even *plausibly* yes, the headline would state it as an
    unqualified fact).

Stop being such credulous, incurious motherfuckers. Thank you.
