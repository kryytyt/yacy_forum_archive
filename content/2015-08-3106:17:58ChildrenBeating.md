> According to the study, \"Escaping from Children\'s Abuse of Social
> Robots,\" obstruction like this wasn\'t nearly the worst of it. The
> tots\' behavior often escalated, and sometimes they\'d get violent,
> hitting and kicking Robovie. They also engaged in verbal abuse,
> calling the robot \"bad words.\" \[\...\]
>
> Next, they designed an abuse-evading algorithm to help the robot avoid
> situations where tiny humans might gang up on it. *Literally* tiny
> humans: the robot is programmed to run away from people who are below
> a certain height and escape in the direction of taller people. When it
> encounters a human, the system calculates the probability of abuse
> based on interaction time, pedestrian density, and the presence of
> people above or below 4 feet 6 inches in height. If the robot is
> statistically in danger, it changes its course towards a more crowded
> area or a taller person. This ensures that an adult is there to
> intervene when one of the little brats decides to pound the robot\'s
> head with a bottle (which only happened a couple times). \[\...\]
>
> When questioned, 74 percent of the kids described the robot as
> \"human-like\" and only 13 percent as \"machine-like.\" Half of them
> said that they believed that their behavior was \"stressful or
> painful\" for the robot. So basically, most of these kids perceive the
> robot they\'re abusing as lifelike, and then just go ahead and abuse
> it anyway. While that\'s a little disturbing, it appears to be in line
> with some child psychology research on animal abuse.
