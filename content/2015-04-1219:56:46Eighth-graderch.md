> Domanik Green, an eighth-grader at Paul R. Smith Middle School in
> Holiday, Florida, was charged with an offense against a computer
> system and felony unauthorized access, according to a report published
> Thursday by The Tampa Bay Times. In late March, the youth allegedly
> used the administrative-level password without permission to log in to
> the school\'s network and change the images displayed on a teacher\'s
> computer to one of two men kissing.

> While the factual allegations laid out in the article seem to indicate
> the youth perpetrated some form of trespass, they also alleged a
> litany of poor practices on the part of school administrators. These
