> This one was a hangout for some of the men in a local volunteer fire
> brigade: The Hook & Ladder Firefighting Company. \[\...\]
>
> No one seems to agree on exactly how the fight at the brothel got
> started. Some blame a particularly loudmouthed clown. Some say the
> clowns cut in line \-- or knocked the hat off a fireman\'s head. But
> this much is clear: that night, the clowns kicked some firefighting
> ass. At least two of the firemen were seriously injury, dragged out of
> the brothel to safety as the Hook & Ladder crew retreated. For the
> rest of the night, the clowns could drink and screw in peace. \[\...\]
>
> By the time they got there, it had started. People were throwing
> stones. And while the circus performers and the carnies were
> apparently able to hold the mob off for a while, it couldn\'t last.
> Eventually, the crowd overwhelmed them. And when the Hook & Ladders
> arrived, all hell broke loose. They stormed the circus with pikes and
> axes, overturned wagons, pulled down the tents and the Big Top and set
> them on fire. They beat clowns to a pulp. Circus folk ran for their
> lives. Some dove into the lake for safety. It was mayhem.
>
> It took the mayor to settle things down. He came to the Fair Green in
> person, kept a fireman from killing a clown with an axe by grabbing it
> out of his hands, and called in the militia to take control of the
> situation. Once things had calmed down, the circus performers came
> back for their belongings and then ran like hell.
>
> The police had done pretty much nothing. They just watched. Even Chief
> Sherwood himself had eventually shown up, but could only claim to have
> stopped the rioters from setting fire to the cages of the animals. Of
> the 17 people who were charged in the riot, only one was ever
> convicted. All of the police who were at the scene claimed they
> couldn\'t remember any of the Orangemen who had been there. Just like
> they had a few weeks earlier, after the Fireman\'s Riot on Church.
