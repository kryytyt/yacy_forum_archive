I found out that the API is nonfunctional, as well as the whole ranking
algorithm. These are pragmatic facts I already wrote about, and you can
find confirmations via google.\

Moreover, what is instead my opinion, is that the project leadership is
roaming toward messy random goals rather than a defined roadmap. What
results is that, after 10 years of development, Yacy still suffers major
design defects and is, in fact, entirely broken, as you may google for.
