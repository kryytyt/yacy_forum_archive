> [Imagine, if you
> can,](http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/prajlich/forster.html) a small
> room, hexagonal in shape, like the cell of a bee. It is lighted
> neither by window nor by lamp, yet it is filled with a soft radiance.
> There are no apertures for ventilation, yet the air is fresh. There
> are no musical instruments, and yet, at the moment that my meditation
> opens, this room is throbbing with melodious sounds. An armchair is in
> the centre, by its side a reading-desk-that is all the furniture. And
> in the armchair there sits a swaddled lump of flesh-a woman, about
> five feet high, with a face as white as a fungus. It is to her that
> the little room belongs.
