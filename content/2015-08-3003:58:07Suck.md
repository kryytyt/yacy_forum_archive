This article is *ten years old* and is about a defunct web site *ten
years older than that*, but Suck was one of the best things to climb out
of the slime of the primordial web, and this retro-retrospective made me
all nostalgic.

Somewhere around a year in to Suck\'s lifetime I was on \"vacation\" and
I read the whole site from the beginning in one sitting, and then sent
them a rambling stream-of-consciousness fan letter that didn\'t have
much in the way of sentence- or paragraph breaks. Carl said, \"You read
*all* of Suck? Even we don\'t have the courage to do that,\" and then he
sent me a t-shirt.

The other day this guy was interviewing me and we talked about Suck and
how it had managed to capture a snapshot of the festering shitstain that
passed for \"tech culture\" \-- \"Way better than fucking *Dilbert*
did\", I said \-- and we laughed a dejected laugh.
