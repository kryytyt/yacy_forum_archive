English • Aggregate / Clear duplicate results
=============================================

Date: 2015-03-18 00:25:39

As you can see from the attached screenshot, lots of YaCy search results
are duplicate or very similar and are positioned adjacently throughout
the results list. So similar to be practically indistinguishable to the
user and be of no utility to occupy the ranking list.\
\
I think it would be best for YaCy to recognize these duplicates and tidy
them up.\
\
What do you think?
