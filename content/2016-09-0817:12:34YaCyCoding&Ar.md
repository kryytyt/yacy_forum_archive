YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ quick results without P2P vs. remote search
========================================================================

Date: 2016-09-08 17:12:34

The bootstrap webclient
<https://github.com/yacy/yacy_webclient_bootstrap> now points by default
to <http://search.yacy.net> using the solr endpoint. It can be hosted as
github pages and thats the case with that repository. It can be tested
at <http://yacy.github.io/yacy_webclient_bootstrap/>\
\
This shows how fast a YaCy search page could deliver search results, if
no p2p activity is done. I believe we should consider this method as
default in the future and abandon the old YaCy search page to move on to
a modern architecture of web pages using a JSON service and a standard
search engine backend (here: Solr. elasticsearch may come someday\...).\
\
The question is: how can we still integrate a p2p search? Doing p2p and
collecting the results would make it necessary to push their results
into the index before retrieving the combined result. I did not test
that yet but I doubt that this is fast.\
An alternative would be, to search in the p2p network \_after\_ the
result has been delivered - just to enrich the search index further for
the next search. But that would work only for large search portals with
many users.
