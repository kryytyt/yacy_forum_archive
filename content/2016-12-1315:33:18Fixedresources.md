Fixed resource switch button overlapping at various screen sizes.

Fixes second part of mantis 708
(http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=708)

The bootstrap-switch component has some sizing issues with long labels,
which are not likely to be solved soon due to a lack of resources on
that project (see issue
https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/419 )

This fix works by applying the following ideas :
 - labels are long, so font-size and padding are reduced on small screen
sizes using a media query
 - use relative percent width values on the component wrappers to
prevent overlapping on the neighbour content
 - disable animation because it relies on absolute pixels width values
```
