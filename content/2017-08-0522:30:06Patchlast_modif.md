``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
Patch last_modified date with internal FirstSeenTime() if no date provided
to make sure updated documents are indexed with their last-modified
date as provided in current crawl. 
(to patch moddate always with firstseen might bear the risk of miss 
actual updates).
```
