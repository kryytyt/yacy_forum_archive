Last days I looked at some sites regarding the topic:\
\
- german webmaster that lives in germany\
- website in a foreign language\
\
and I found out that its not that easy to run a website in a foreign
language.\
\
1. A german webmaster has to follow the german laws\
(\"Impressum\", \"Datenschutzerklärung\", \... ) which is something like
\"Legal Notice\" and \"Privacy Policy\".\
\
2. If a website addresses people from a foreign country the webmaster
may also have to follow the laws of a/that foreign country.\
\
-\> A spanish website/forum would mean Orbiter would have to call a
spanish lawyer for creating neccessary law texts and so on.\
-\> The forum would need an \"Impressum\", \"Datenschutzerklärung\",
\"Legal Notice\"?, \"Privacy Policy\"? and don\'t know what its called
in Spain if they also have got something like that.\
\
3. I\'m no lawyer just what I think about this topic after some texts.
