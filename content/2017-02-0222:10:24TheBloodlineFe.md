is one of my favorite books / series and you should read it! It has the
\"changeling / long lost princess\" trappings of much fantasy, but
actually it\'s about *economics*, and why the \"elves\" would probably
be narcoterrorists.

Every time I watch an episode of *Game of Thrones*, I wish I was
watching an episode of *The Merchant Princes* instead.

The first book in his second series set in this world just came out,
[*Empire
Games*](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2017/01/empire-games.html),
and it is also fantastic.

Though sadly, baseline reality seems to have already shot past some of
his more outlandish predictions, just like in the [*Laundry*
series\...](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2016/08/reality-is-broken-1.html)
