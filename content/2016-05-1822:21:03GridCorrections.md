> [By superimposing a rectangular grid](https://www.vimeo.com/160335390)
> on the earth surface, a grid built from exact square miles, the
> spherical deviations have to be fixed. After all, the grid has only
> two dimensions. The north-south boundaries in the grid are on the
> lines of longitude, which converge to the north. The roads that follow
> these boundaries must dogleg every twenty-four miles to counter the
> diminishing distances.
