Fragen und Antworten â€¢ Possible to ignore robot.txt
===================================================

Date: 2016-12-21 02:11:42

Hello,\
\
I\'m crawling the websites of a company my employer recently acquired. I
setup a list of around 12,000 sites inside yacy to crawl the sites. Yacy
is crawling the sites without issue. However, a number of them have
robots.txt set to noindex and nofollow. How can I change all sites to
ignore robots.txt? The advanced crawler has options for this, but it
doesn\'t seem to work for sites already in the index/crawler.\
\
Thank you.
