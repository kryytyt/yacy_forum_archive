move java environment parameter setting disabling SNI (Server Name Indicator) support for https connections from code to startup script allowing admin to ~easy/transparent alter the YaCy default FALSE setting.
Background: some user report problem with connecting/crawling some sites via https which require SNI support (by default switched off in YaCy). On the other hand systems not demanding SNI support are sometimes not properly configured and due to a bug/feature in java 1.7 connection is aborted. The later is more often the case, so the default is still fine. With the java start parameter expert user can no alter the startparameter to -Djsse.enableSNIExtension=true (java default) if they crawl more hosts requiring SNI support.
The alternative to let YaCy try both during https handshake (deep inside the httpclient) is not pursut at this time.
