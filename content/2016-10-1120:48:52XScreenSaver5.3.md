[XScreenSaver 5.36](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/) is out now!

Five new hacks this time, all by me: **discoball**, **cubetwist**,
**cubestack**, **splodesic** and **hexstrut**. Plus some [other
stuff](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/changelog.html).

(You can always tell that my business is in a disastrous,
sphincter-puckering freefall when I start spending a lot of time writing
screen savers to distract myself from it. Hooray.)

Anyway, I\'m particularly fond of how **splodesic** came out. It\'s
blows up very soothingly and the colors are nice.

Fun fact: **discoball** was inspired by one very *particular* broke-ass,
dusty disco ball at a local concert venue, which I have been staring up
at a few times a month for many years. See if you can guess which. I\'m
not a fan of disco balls. I think they are the world\'s cheesiest
lighting instrument, just a step up from christmas tree lights stuffed
in a plastic bag. Consider this saver to be my editorial on that topic.

The [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/xscreensaver/id539014593?mt=8)
and
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jwz.xscreensaver)
versions are out now too.

If you\'re an Android developer, we could use your help sanding down the
remaining rough edges on that port. The `android/README` contains a todo
list.
