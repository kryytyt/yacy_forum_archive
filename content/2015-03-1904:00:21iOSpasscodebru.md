> We recently became aware of a device known as an IP Box that was being
> used in the phone repair markets to bruteforce the iOS screenlock.

>
> What is surprising however is that this still works even with the
> \"Erase data after 10 attempts\" configuration setting enabled. Our
> initial analysis indicates that the IP Box is able to bypass this
> restriction by connecting directly to the iPhone\'s power source and
> aggressively cutting the power after each failed PIN attempt, but
> before the attempt has been synchronized to flash memory. As such,
> each PIN entry takes approximately 40 seconds, meaning that it would
> take up to \~111 hours to bruteforce a 4 digit PIN.

*4 digits: 4 1/2 days. 5 digits: 45 days. 6 digits: 16 months. 7 digits:
