you start from the premise of refusing to be an asshole, then a lot of
other decisions kind of make
themselves.\"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brick-brick/201507/steve-albini-shows-punk-rock-ethics-are-good-business)

> \"There are kind of two perspectives on business. One of them is that
> a business exists to make money for the investor class that has a
> stake in that business. That\'s one perspective. So, from a
> stock-market perspective, from a shareholder perspective, from an
> investor perspective, that from any publicly held company\'s
> perspective, the company\'s reason to exist is to make money for those
> people,\" he explained. \"And if you\'re not making money, you\'re a
> failing company. If its share price doesn\'t go up, then the
> company\'s failing, whether you\'re making a profit or not. The idea
> is that the fundamental reason for that company to be there is to make
> money.\"
>
> Albini contrasts this approach to how he runs his business. \"From an
> entrepreneurial standpoint, from someone like me \-- someone who
> builds a business for a reason \-- the reason my company exists is to
> make recordings of music. And in so doing, every now and again we\'ll
> turn a profit. But that\'s not why we\'re in business. We\'re not in
> business so that we can make money. And there\'s a pretty strong
> argument that most businesses that are not part of the public sphere,
> not part of the investment transaction or equity management or
> whatever, most businesses operate on that level,\" he said.

> \"Like a bakery opens because a guy wants to make bread. A tavern
> opens because a guy wants to serve beer to people. That\'s why people
> start businesses. It\'s because they want to do something with their
> time. They want that enterprise to be how they spend their days. But
> from an academic standpoint or from an analytical standpoint or from
> the standpoint of publicly held companies and investment class and
> everything, the reason the company started is meaningless. All they
> want to know is the share price going up. And for people like me that
> seems insane.\"
>
> \"It\'s like defining a marriage by the size of the house it occupies
> as opposed to defining the marriage by the love between two people and
> the life they build for themselves and the experience they share as
> part of the marriage. \[\...\]

> \"If I see a competitor studio that\'s having trouble with something
> that\'s a problem that we\'ve solved here at Electrical Audio, I\'m
> not going to keep that information to myself and watch them flounder.
> I\'m going to share that information with them. And that from a
> \'business\' standpoint is a mistake \-- from a corporate thinking Art
> of War, Sun Tzu bullshit kind of scenario \-- that\'s a mistake.\"
>
> \"But from being a decent person seeing someone else in trouble and
> helping them out standpoint, that\'s just being a decent person. And
> that\'s where I feel like if your basic principles are based in these
> business precepts, you\'re prevented from being the best possible
> person. You\'re prevented from being a good guy.\"
>
> \"I think that it\'s an ethical way to conduct myself; otherwise, I
> wouldn\'t do it. I do think it\'s ethically sound to treat everyone
> fair and to be open and equal in your treatment of everybody and to be
> inclusive of everybody. I think that is an ethical thing to do,\" he
> said. \"And I have less respect for the profit motive. In fact, I kind
> of feel like the profit motive is a pathology, because it engenders
> sociopathic behavior, and on a corporate scale, the profit motive is
> extraordinarily destructive. So I don\'t have respect for it. But
> because of the way capitalism has been portrayed in this country, I
> don\'t expect other people to think that way.\"
