> The emailed response from the Guggenheim\'s chief curator to the White
> House was polite but firm: The museum could not accommodate a request
> to borrow a painting by Vincent Van Gogh for President and Melania
> Trump\'s private living quarters. The curator\'s alternative: an
> 18-karat, fully functioning, solid gold toilet \-- an interactive work
> titled \"America\" that critics have described as pointed satire aimed
> at the excess of wealth in this country.
>
> For a year, the Guggenheim had exhibited \"America\" \-- the creation
> of contemporary artist Maurizio Cattelan \-- in a public restroom on
> the museum\'s fifth floor for visitors to use. But the exhibit was
> over and the toilet was available \"should the President and First
> Lady have any interest in installing it in the White House,\" Spector
> wrote in an email obtained by The Washington Post.
>
> The artist \"would like to offer it to the White House for a long-term
> loan,\" wrote Spector, who has been critical of Trump. \"It is, of
> course, extremely valuable and somewhat fragile, but we would provide
> all the instructions for its installation and care.\" \[\...\]

> The White House did not respond to inquiries about the matter.

> On the face of it, President Trump might appreciate an artist\'s
> rendering of a gilded toilet, given his well-documented history of

> even his airplane. But the president is also a self-described
> germaphobe, and it\'s an open question whether he would accept a
> previously used toilet, 18-karat or otherwise.

> Cattelan\'s \"America\" caused something of a sensation after the
> Guggenheim unveiled it in 2016, drawing more than a few headlines.
> \[\...\] \"More than one hundred thousand people\" who \"waited

*They should have offered a golden shower instead.*
