\-- which, amazingly, is an actual URL that works \-- lets you run
ancient web browsers *in your browser*, but instead of pointing those
old browsers at anachronistically modern versions of those pages, it
pulls the correspondingly-old pages out of the [Wayback
Machine](http://archive.org/web/).

It runs the browsers by running a virtual Linux on the backend, that
then runs emulators of the older operating systems inside it, that
themselves run the browsers. It\'s turtles all the way down.

This is absolutely brilliant. [Source
