Here are the instructions for configuring port forwarding on my router.
I think I followed them correctly\...\
\
<http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/24046>\
\
UPnP is on, and in the Yacy configuration I see a green checkmark next
to \"Configure your router for Yacy,\" but in system monitoring, it
still says the peer can not be found.\
\
Update: Suddenly, the green checkmark has been replaced with
\"Configuration was not successful. This may take a moment.\"\

I think it\'s different. I have the internal IP and a different IP,
which one can use to connect to the router over the internet. It is in
the router settings. It is different from the IP given in canyouseeme
and yacy.info.
