since twitter decided to switch off RSS feeds it is not easy any more to
integrate tweets in YaCy search results. We would need a twitter scraper
which may be possible to set specific crawl filter rules. Someone must
invest some work to find out what to do exactly to crawl Twitter
accounts in a nice way.\
(to everyone): please invest some time to find a solution.
