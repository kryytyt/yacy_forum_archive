Thanks for answering.\
As I understand it, the first time the crawler encounters a document
doesn\'t necessarily correspond to the lowest depth at which such
document may be found.\
For example, if the crawler is instructed to start its scan from
multiple starting URLs, when it descends both those URLs it may find a
same document from both \"crawling paths\", potentially at different
depths. In other words, the crawler may encounter again an
already-indexed document, but at a lower depth.\
\
In this case, which depth is used, the one where the document was first
encountered, or the lowest known?
