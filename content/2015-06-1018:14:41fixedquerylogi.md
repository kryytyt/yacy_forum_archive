``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
fixed query logic which was not able to recognize '-' correctly.
Furthermore fixed 'and only' query syntax which was not the same as in
twitter (all terms must match)
Additionally enabled negative usage of search for hashtags, users and
user mentions.
```
