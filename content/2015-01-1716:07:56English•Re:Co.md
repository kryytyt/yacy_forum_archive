English â€¢ Re: Config pls New Cloud Group + Migration of Robinson Serve
======================================================================

HI and thanks for your reply.\
\
All the servers are cloud based.\
Hence, there is always a limitation on the internal size available for
the ubuntu + YaCy dual Solr cores.\
\
Our concept is to use individual servers with their own internal dual
Solr cores, and connect them together in P2P + DHT to achieve maximum
search and indexing speeds - shared across multiple individual clouds.\
This will also facilitate failback and recover, later.\
\
Our problem now is that we have multiple servers that should be sharing
but are in fact acting like Robinson servers that read each other.\
Hence, our migration from cross-reading Robinson servers to a full P2P +
DHT group is incomplete.\
Our network is the original\

Likely this needs to be changed, but how to do it and not lose our many
GB of data?\
This is the only \'selectable\' when starting our kind of
environment\...which we started in cross-reading Robinson servers.\
We suspect that the network ID needs to be changed, but we do not know
how to do it safely.\
Many thanks!
