Firmware Update to Address Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in Implantable Cardiac Pacemakers
==========================================================================================

[![](https://www.jwz.org/images/heart-plugs.jpg)\"FDA approved a
firmware update\" is a headline from a particularly dystopian
future.](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm573669.htm)

> The firmware update requires an in-person patient visit with a health
> care provider \-- it cannot be done from home via Merlin.net. The
> update process will take approximately 3 minutes to complete.
>
> During this time, the device will operate in backup mode (pacing at 67
> beats per minute), and essential, life-sustaining features will remain
> available. At the completion of the update, the device will return to
> its pre-update settings.
>
> As with any firmware update, there is a very low risk of an update
> malfunction. Based on St. Jude Medical\'s previous firmware update
> experience, installing the updated firmware could potentially result
> in the following malfunctions (including the rate of occurrence
> previously observed):
>
> -   reloading of previous firmware version due to incomplete update
>     (0.161 percent),
> -   loss of currently programmed device settings (0.023 percent),
> -   loss of diagnostic data (none reported), or
> -   complete loss of device functionality (0.003 percent).
>
> For pacing dependent patients, consider performing the cybersecurity
> firmware update in a facility where temporary pacing and pacemaker
> generator can be readily provided.

Also, today I learned that it\'s possible to boot pacemakers in Safe
Mode.

Half a million vulnerable devices, out there in bodies, waiting for the
Barron to pop their heart-plug.
