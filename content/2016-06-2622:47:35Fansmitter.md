Exfiltration from (Speakerless) Air-Gapped

> In this paper, we present Fansmitter, a malware that can acoustically
> exfiltrate data from air- gapped computers, even when audio hardware
> and speakers are not present. Our method utilizes the noise emitted
> from the CPU and chassis fans which are present in virtually every
> computer today. We show that a software can regulate the internal
> fans\' speed in order to control the acoustic waveform emitted from a
> computer. \[\...\] We demonstrated the effective transmission of
> encryption keys and passwords from a distance of zero to eight meters,
> with bit rate of up to 900 bits/hour.
