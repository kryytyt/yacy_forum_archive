> A fatberg believed to be Britain\'s biggest ever weighing a 130-tonnes
> and stretching more than 850ft-long has been found lurking under the
> streets of Whitechapel. \[\...\]
>
> Engineers have now started their three-week war against the disgusting
> fatberg using high pressure hoses to dislodge the muck which is then
> sucked up into a fleet of tankers.
>
> Thames Water\'s head of waste networks Matt Rimmer said: \"This
> fatberg is up there with the biggest we\'ve ever seen. It\'s a total
> monster and taking a lot of manpower and machinery to remove as it\'s
> set hard. It\'s basically like trying to break up concrete. It\'s
> frustrating as these situations are totally avoidable and caused by
> fat, oil and grease being washed down sinks and wipes flushed down the
> loo.\"
>
> The last huge fatberg, which was Britain\'s biggest until now, was
> discovered in Kingston-upon-Thames, south west London, in 2013.
