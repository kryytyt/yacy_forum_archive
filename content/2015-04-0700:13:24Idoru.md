So at first glance it\'s just some squeaky popstar video with
slightly-cyber teledildonic styling. But if you are me, you watch it and
think, \"Wait, is this actually a *song*, or is this a commercial for a
drink?\" Then a little while later, \"Wait, is this a *fake* commercial
for a drink?\" Then, \"Wait, is this a *real* commercial trying to
*look* fake?\"

YES. YES, IT IS ALL THESE THINGS. Because the Advertising Ouroboros is
so far up its ass that NOTHING IS REAL and we\'re all living in some PK
Dick time-slip!

The commercial includes *other commercials!* It\'s commercials all the
way down!

Part of me wants to *KILL IT WITH FIRE,* but part of me wonders why my
bar isn\'t already carrying this.

Ok, so now let\'s set the Wayback Machine to 1996. If you were me, you
were making some questionable fashion decisions like wearing vinyl and
shopping at Cyberdog, but all right-thinking people were listening Fluke
and playing *Wipeout XL,* and that means you had a huge nerd-boner crush
on fictional anti-gravity racing league star Ariel Tetsuo from the
[Atombomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHMzCpy0fXc) video:

(Incidentally, if anyone has a higher quality version of that video,
please let me know.)

So the *Atombomb* video is basically a commercial for *Wipeout XL*. But
that\'s ok, right? Because the song was on the game\'s soundtrack, and
they both *completely rule*, so it gets a pass. You tell yourself. If
you are me.

But here\'s the thing about *Wipeout:* the racetracks in the game
actually have billboards above them, advertising Red Bull. *But!* When
the game was released, Red Bull didn\'t exist in the United States \--
it wasn\'t to show up here for another year or two. I assumed those
in-game billboards were for a *fictional product from the year 2097.*
They had the right styling for it!

Surprisingly, that *Atombomb* video does *not* show any of the Red Bull
billboards. There is an [inexplicable alternate
edit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Nq6PzY0xA) of the video that is
shorter but includes more game footage, and at one point there\'s a
billboard that says \"ENERGY DRINK\" but the Red Bull logo has been
removed. I wonder who paid or didn\'t pay.

Guess what was released three weeks before *Wipeout XL?* Gibson\'s
*Idoru.*

Oh, and in answer to the rhetorical question of why my bar isn\'t
already carrying QT, it\'s because we have an exclusivity agreement with
Red Bull.

And the Ouroboros chomps down just a little bit tighter.
