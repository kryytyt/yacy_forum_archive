> The homeless people the boulders were intended to dissuade simply
> moved their tents a few feet away. Most of the rocks stand a few feet
> high, and at about 400 pounds are too heavy to move easily. But there
> is plenty of space left between them for sleeping bags \-- and plenty
> of Hairball ground beyond that for pitching tents.
>
> \"Not sure why they thought this would stop us, but it didn\'t,\"
> James Ayres, 36, said Thursday as he stood outside his tent at the
> Hairball, on a dirt field about 50 feet from a cluster of boulders.
> \"Maybe they\'ll put more out here. I don\'t know. They\'ve got lots
> of money to do it. But for now, you could camp right between them if
> you want. I mean, really, it\'s kind of funny.\" \[\...\]
>
> This dynamic has played out for decades, from resentment when benches
> at Civic Center Plaza were removed in the 1990s to keep people from
> sleeping on them, to sprinklers being installed at St. Mary\'s
> Cathedral doorways in 2015 where homeless people slept. The sprinklers
> were taken out after a public outcry, but the benches have never come
> back \-- and many benches around the city, particularly at bus stops,
> are now designed to make them tough to stretch out on.
