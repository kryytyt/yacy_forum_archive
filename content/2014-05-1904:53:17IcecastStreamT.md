So I [wrote this
thing](http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/src/archiver/streamtest/)
yesterday. I don\'t know how useful it is, but maybe it will help me
figure out what\'s going on the next time iTunes breaks everything.

Let me know if it leads you to any interesting or useful discoveries.

It\'s probably the case that [this blog
post](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/01/itunes-and-streaming/) is no
longer completely true with iTunes 11.1.5, but I haven\'t tested it
thoroughly. I started to do that, since I wanted to make sure that
[mixtape 14Ã˜](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/05/jwz-mixtape-140/) was
working properly, but then I realized, *\"Wait, what the fuck am I
doing?\"* and just added support for audio mixtapes through a jPlayer
popup instead, so that I don\'t have to *care* whether iTunes works. And
that seems to be working, even on iOS. So there\'s that.
