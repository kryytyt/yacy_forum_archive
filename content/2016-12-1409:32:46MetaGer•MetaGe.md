==========================================================

MetaGer anonymizes the Internet addresses of the users and do not saved
them since many years. Nevertheless: if an attacker would have hacked
MetaGer, this attacker can read your addresses and data and store them
on his own servers. MetaGer is in the certainly best possible
hacker-secured environment, but a 100% security against hackers - be it
NSA state hackers or others - is nowhere. This is why we have
implemented an additional approach to MetaGer, which, according to the
current state of knowledge, provides the highest security level at which
your data are even not visible on the MetaGer server:\
\
This is the MetaGer-TOR-hidden service - accessible via:
<http://metager.de/tor>\
\
Without branching into difficult details, here is a short guide on how
to use MetaGer via this service (just click on the link above is not
enough!):\
\
1) Go to the website of the TOR project: <https://www.torproject.org/>
and click on \"Download Tor\".\
2) Install the \"Tor Browser\" on your PC. This is easy, it does not
need to be compiled / configured, etc. This browser is a customized
instance of Firefox.\
3) Enter the address <http://metager.de/tor> in this gate browser\
4) Then click on: \"Hidden-Service öffnen\"\
\
Then use MetaGer as anonymously as is possible, according to today\'s
state of Internet technology. If you have installed and already opend
the \"Tor Browser\", you can also directly access the MetaGer-TOR-hidden
service: <http://b7cxf4dkdsko6ah2.onion/tor/>\
If you want to know more about the TOR-hidden service,check:
<https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en> There is a
good explanation.\
\
In these times of Internet total surveillance, we should do what we can
to make snooping more difficult - but at the very least \"scatter sand
into the snoopers eyes\".
