> Companies like Facebook and Twitter rely on an army of workers
> employed to soak up the worst of humanity in order to protect the rest
> of us. And there are legions of them \-- a vast, invisible pool of
> human labor. Hemanshu Nigam, the former chief security officer of
> MySpace who now runs online safety consultancy SSP Blue, estimates
> that the number of content moderators scrubbing the world\'s social
> media sites, mobile apps, and cloud storage services runs to \"well
> over 100,000\" \-- that is, about twice the total head count of Google
> and nearly 14 times that of Facebook.
>
> This work is increasingly done in the Philippines. A former US colony,
> the Philippines has maintained close cultural ties to the United
> States, which content moderation companies say helps Filipinos
> determine what Americans find offensive. And moderators in the
> Philippines can be hired for a fraction of American wages. Ryan
> Cardeno, a former contractor for Microsoft in the Philippines, told me
> that he made \$500 per month by the end of his three-and-a-half-year
> tenure with outsourcing firm Sykes. Last year, Cardeno was offered
> \$312 per month by another firm to moderate content for Facebook,
> paltry even by industry standards. \[\...\]

> Eight years after the fact, Jake Swearingen can still recall the video
> that made him quit. \[\...\] Three days in, a video of an apparent
> beheading came across his queue. \"Oh fuck! I\'ve got a beheading!\"
> he blurted out. A slightly older colleague in a black hoodie casually
> turned around in his chair. \"Oh,\" he said, \"which one?\" At that
> moment Swearingen decided he did not want to become a connoisseur of
> beheading videos. \[\...\]

> \"Everybody hits the wall, generally between three and five months,\"
> says a former YouTube content moderator I\'ll call Rob. \"You just
> think, \'Holy shit, what am I spending my day doing? This is
> awful.\'\" \[\...\] \"If someone was uploading animal abuse, a lot of
> the time it was the person who did it. He was proud of that,\" Rob
> says. \"And seeing it from the eyes of someone who was proud to do the
> fucked-up thing, rather than news reporting on the fucked-up thing \--
> it just hurts you so much harder, for some reason. It just gives you a
> much darker view of humanity.\" \[\...\]

> \"I get really affected by bestiality with children,\" she says. \"I
> have to stop. I have to stop for a moment and loosen up, maybe go to
> Starbucks and have a coffee.\" She laughs at the absurd juxtaposition

> Constant exposure to videos like this has turned some of Maria\'s
> coworkers intensely paranoid. Every day they see proof of the infinite
> variety of human depravity. They begin to suspect the worst of people
> they meet in real life, wondering what secrets their hard drives might
> hold. Two of Maria\'s female coworkers have become so suspicious that
> they no longer leave their children with babysitters. They sometimes
> miss work because they can\'t find someone they trust to take care of
> their kids.
