Hi Ainslie,\
\
you\'re right, from a fresh install YaCy crawls nothing until you start
a crawl by giving a startpoint.\
But your gets Index-Data from other peers and this is already very
helpful, resolving a search-request.\
\
I don\'t understand what you mean by the basic rules to crawl per
default.\
If you don\'t limit the crawler to the start domain, and give a high
crawling depth you will get more than we are able to handle very soon

\
You can also help others that distribute their crawl-jobs, by enabling
remote-crawling (/RemoteCrawl\_p.html).\
Once You got Index-Data, there are also old pages in the index, these
may need to be recrawled (/IndexReIndexMonitor\_p.html).\
\
For me it is best that all the users start crawling pages of their
interest, to get a well blended index.\
