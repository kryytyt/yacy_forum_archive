Hilfe für Einsteiger und Anwender • Poor performances of YaCy
=============================================================

Date: 2012-12-14 16:52:16

Hello everybody.\
\
I\'m a new user to YaCy, and I just installed the last version of YaCy
on my server.\
However, it seems I achieve poor performances.\
It is a standard installation, on the main Global network. I didn\'t
change anything, except network port and performance related settings -
see below.\
\
YaCy appears to be mostly idle. For instance, on the \"Status\" page, I
have:\

Code: 
:   `Queues======Loader Queue:            0 | 200Local Crawl              0       Remote triggered Crawl   0       Pre-Queueing             0`

\
while my speed is said to be 0 pages/minute\...\
Following the first minutes of launch, YaCy was very busy, retrieving a
lot of data from DHT, as well as indexing at about 500 PPM. So it used
to work \"fine\" I would say.\
\
I followed what is recommended here:
[http://www.yacy-websuche.de/wiki/index. \...
erformance](http://www.yacy-websuche.de/wiki/index.php/En:Performance){.postlink}
but there is little to no change.\
I increased memory from 600 MB to 5,000 MB, and the word cache from
90,000 to 450,000 words.\
Yet, memory usage oscillate between 2,500 and 3,500 MB, and the word
indexing cache is only at 1,000 words, according to the performance
page.\
CPU usage is very low as well.\
\
So, what can I do to increase YaCy indexing rate ?
