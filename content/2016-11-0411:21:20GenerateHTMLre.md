Generate HTML relative (to each peer) links from hosted WikiCode.

When WikiCode inserted in a peer hosted Blog, Wiki, Messages or Profile
contains relative links (images or any content, hosted in DATA/HTDOCS),
it is more reliable to keep these links relative, especially when the
peer is behind any kind of reverse Proxy.
