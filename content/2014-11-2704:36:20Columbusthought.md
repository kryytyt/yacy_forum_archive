> form of a pear, which is very round except where the stalk grows, at
> which part it is most prominent; or like a round ball, upon one part
> of which is a prominence like a woman\'s nipple, this protrusion being
> the highest and nearest the sky, situated under the equinoctial line,
> and at the eastern extremity of this sea \-- I call that the eastern
> extremity, where the land and the islands end.

> Ptolemy and the other philosophers, who have written upon the globe,

> round as well as that in which they themselves dwelt, the centre of
> which was in the island of Arin, which is under the equinoctial line
> between the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Persia; and the circle passes
> over Cape St. Vincent, in Portugal, westward, and eastward, by Cangara

> highest part was below the arctic pole, by which reasoning it appears,
> that they understood, that one part of the world must be loftier, and
> nearer the sky, than the other; but it never struck them that it might
> be under the equinoctial, in the way that I have said, which is not to
> be wondered at, because they had no certain knowledge respecting this
> hemisphere, but merely vague suppositions, for no one has ever gone or
> been sent to investigate the matter, until now that your Highnesses
> have sent me to explore both the sea and the land.
