What do you think of this site <http://yacyweb.tripod.com> ?\
\
After reading this thread here is what I have come up with in the last 2
days.\
\
I use Dropbox\'s public folder to host the yacy files. After retrieving
the links for the web page in the public folder to get to the 3
versions.\
I use Bitly to keep a track of the number of clicks redirected from a
Dyndns.org a web hop.\
That way when I exceed my 20 Gig daily limit in traffic I could quickly
switch to new Dropbox account or even have 3 for the various versions.\
I am not sure what the bandwidth limit is for Tripod but the page is 26
k long.\
\
Currently the links that take you to my drop box are named:\
<http://www.yacywindows.is-by.us>\
<http://www.yacylinux.is-by.us>\
<http://www.yacymac.is-by.us>\
About 4 min to download the windows release.\
\
Can some one else confirm with the yacy manual update system if one was
to manually download the 2 files and put them into
c:\\yacy\\data\\release folder yacy would still install and work ok. I
have removed and put back releases and they appear on and off the list
ok.
