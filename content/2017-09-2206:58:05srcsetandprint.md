srcset and printing
===================

\"Today I learned something new and stupid.\"

I should know that everything involving printing is just\...
perma-stupid. But still.

I\'ve been tweaking both web sites to use `<IMG SRCSET>` in a few places
in an attempt to speed things up a bit by downloading less data. The
spec for `SRCSET` is actually pretty sensible, allowing the browser to
download an appropriately-sized image based on the size of its window,
the relationship between screen pixels and display pixels, and your hint
as to how much of the screen the image will take up..

So let\'s say you\'ve got a stack of `SRCSET` images, and the image on
your screen is, let\'s say \"five inches\" wide, whatever that means,
and the vagaries of the world result in the 768px image being used for
that. So then you hit print. And now you\'re going to be printing a
\"five inch\" image on a 300dpi device. Does it use the 1600px image for
that?

The hell it does. It scales up the blurry-assed 768px image.

Safari, Mozilla, Chrome and Opera all do this.

This is annoying, because in the DNA store, when you buy a ticket, you
are presented with a page with a image of your ticket on it, like so:

::: {style="max-width: 5in; margin: auto; text-align: center"}
![](https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/768/2017/dnaticket.png){sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 72em"
srcset="https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/768/2017/dnaticket.png 1601w, https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/1280/2017/dnaticket.png 1280w, https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/768/2017/dnaticket.png 768w, https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/640/2017/dnaticket.png 640w, https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/360/2017/dnaticket.png 360w"}
:::

One of the common use cases here is \"print it out and take it with
you\". So I\'ve been serving 1600px PNGs, so that they will print well.
But it sure would be nice if the people who *aren\'t* printing were
being served a smaller file.

So I guess my choices are to keep serving large images always, or have
prints be blurry. \"Hooray.\"

Maybe there\'s some nuttery I could do with `@print` stylesheets in the
CSS to override the `SRC` but that sure sounds fragile.

I mean, hopefully most people are using the Apple Wallet
[`pkpass`](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/01/apple-pass-push-notifications/)
attachment we send them instead of printing, but still, this is dumb and
ought to work.

Incidentally, is there some Android equivalent of `pkpass`? I\'m
including the Google-recommended [EventReservation
microformat](https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/reference/event-reservation)
in the confirmation email, but I tend to assume that microformats are
still just wishful thinking. I haven\'t seen any documents suggesting
that this format actually *does* anything anywhere. Does it? If it does,
what does it look like? (Go buy a [DNA
ticket](https://www.dnalounge.com/tickets/) and send me a screen shot.)
