This isn\'t as tragic as it at first sounds, because it does not leave
the whole drive unlocked; the root shell is in the pre-boot environment.
However, from this shell you have the ability to install backdoors in
/boot or trojan the kernel itself.

But seriously, how many more times is Linux going to have a \"hold down
a key to unlock\" bug? I\'m almost at the point where I need a tag for
this.
