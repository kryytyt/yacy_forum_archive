English â€¢ Results randomly vanish and reappear in consecutive searches
======================================================================

Date: 2014-04-20 09:10:47

I have a Python script set to collect all YaCy results (and their
ranking) for a given query, by using the JSON API. I\'m grabbing results
100 at a time (which appears to be YaCy\'s limit), and incrementing the
pagecount until the resulting JSON has zero results.\
\
This mostly works, but I noticed that some results randomly disappear on
some of the searches, and reappear when I repeat the search. I\'m doing
this in Stealth Mode, so misbehaving network code or remote nodes
aren\'t suspects. I reset the Solr ranking weights to a constant set of
test weights each time I do the search (and wait 5 seconds afterward),
if that matters.\
\
Is there any known issue that would cause results to randomly appear and
disappear from a search for a given query? Any suggestions on how I
might be able to fix this strange behavior?\
\
Thanks.
