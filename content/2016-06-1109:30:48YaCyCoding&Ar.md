YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ LibreJS, JavaScript license in YaCy
================================================================

Date: 2016-06-11 09:30:48

Hello,\
I tried to make JavaScript licensing more clear in YaCy, targeting
LibreJS compliance : see [Pull Request
\#56](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/pull/56){.postlink}.\
I hope I made no Copyright mistake. If someone want to have a look at
[jslicense.html](https://github.com/luccioman/yacy_search_server/blob/LibreJS/htroot/jslicense.html){.postlink}
file, or at copyright headers added to YaCy owned js files in
[/htroot/js](https://github.com/luccioman/yacy_search_server/tree/LibreJS/htroot/js){.postlink},
feedback will be welcome.\
\
What\'s more, I applied the licensing rules for main YaCy web interface,
but not for the sub interface YaCy UI deployed on each node at
/yacy/ui/, because I found it broken each time I tried to use it since
last year. Is this part of YaCy dead? Or do you know if some people
would like to use it, and some effort to bring it back to life could be
useful?
