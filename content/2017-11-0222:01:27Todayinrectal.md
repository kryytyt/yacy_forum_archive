[Chinese doctors remove live eel from constipated man\'s stomach after
folk remedy fails
him](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2088857/chinese-doctors-remove-live-eel-constipated-mans-stomach-after)

> The patient told doctors in Guangzhou that he had heard word on the
> street that his condition could be effectively relieved or even cured
> by a living eel, the Guangzhou Daily reported on Tuesday.
>
> He was hospitalised last week when the live fish began to wreak havoc
> on his intestines after he inserted it in his anus, the report said.
>
> One doctor said that when the man arrived at the hospital, his stomach
> was inflated like an air balloon, causing sharp pain. In surgery they
> found the animal had broken through the intestines and generated \"a
> mess\" in the man\'s abdominal cavity, \"almost killing him\", the
> doctor said.

I can\'t tell if this is just the same report as [this one from 5 years
ago](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/04/please-please-help-me-the-eel-is-moving-through-my-body/)
with the serial numbers filed off. These Chinese ass-eel stories can be
slippery. Hard to get a firm grip on the facts.
