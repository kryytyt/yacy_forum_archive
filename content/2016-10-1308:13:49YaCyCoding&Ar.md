I indeed had already enabled \"Accept remote Index Transmissions\" in
the Network config.\
\
By the way, finally I could reproduce a similar issue on my development
peer : it hanged at more than 100% CPU after running many random search
queries, becoming totally unresponsive.\
In my case I found in the logs the following errors :
\"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded\" and then
\"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\".\
\
Can you check your log and see if you also have these kind of errors?\
\
[Edit :]{style="font-weight: bold"} After restarting my peer and waiting
some time I finally also obtain a continuous CPU usage over 100% without
searching anything. I guess my initial dev index data was not large
enough to see the problem occurring\...\
Some profiling indeed reveals the Hot Spot as expected : the transferURL
servlet is spending all its time in the call of
net.yacy.repository.Blacklist.isListed(). I will report here as soon as
I know a little more about what to optimize.
