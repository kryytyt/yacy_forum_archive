[If a smart weapon running Linux fails to explode is the target entitled
to the GPLed source
code?](https://twitter.com/mjg59/status/921166786380185600)

*\"What is your one purpose in life?\"*\
\

**\@BootlegGirl**

Yes, but if it\'s LGPL they can make the bomb itself proprietary.
Ethical warmongers release weapons as CC0

**\@tveastman**

A missile is technically a deployment, and not just a distribution, so I
guess the rules will be interesting for the AGPL too.

**\@dmarti**

The weapon must include a written offer to distribute the corresponding
source. It doesn\'t matter if a recipient actually runs the software.

But what if the target is under trade embargo, and the sender can\'t
actually fulfill the offer of source code? Do they still have a license?

**\@giladby**

I worked as a consultant on the Iron Done missile defence system It
shoots Linux running missiles designed to intercept incoming missiles.

We debated many questions. If you target another missile, who you are
distributing TO? Would incl. src code on missile enough to satisfy GPL

**\@geofft**

if they target civilians is it a \"User Product\" under GPLv3? \"(2)
anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling\"

**\@fanf**

I am reminded of the guidance computer that leaked memory about as fast
as the rocket used fuel

**\@mk270**

and those jokes about loops in Ada having \"detonation\" as a
termination condition. Sends the Haskellers mental

**\@fanf**

C++ calls this kind of loop undefined behaviour

**\@vathpela**

Depends - would it be legal trade in the first place? (Pretty sure if
the target is a State Sponsor of Terror, you can\'t have a contract\...)

**\@the\_lazyknight**

yes, but reasonable costs for the media may be be levied. So include the
source on the warhead, then charge for the bomb.

**\@danhedron**

Yes, but there is no guarantee they can install their own unsigned
version.

**\@elgarak**

Does this count as malware?

**\@schumaml**

Generalized, it becomes \"If any device is used on you, do you become a
user of the device?\"

**\@uriy**

Yes, but to avoid breaking crypto/munitions export laws you should only
use it against a friendly target.
