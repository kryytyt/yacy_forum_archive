> \"People are buying Victorians and they are going super modern,\" said
> Scott Bowles, former manager of San Francisco Victoriana, a supplier
> of building materials for restoring Victorian homes, which closed in
> April. \"They are ruining the city.\" \[\...\]
>
> Victorian-era architecture is not unique to San Francisco, of course.
> But many of the city\'s wooden homes with turrets and gingerbread
> details produced at the state\'s redwood mills were often designed by
> local architects, built by the same group of developers, or assembled
> from parts ordered from the Sears catalog. They often have distinct
> features and only \-- in \-- San Francisco traits, such as their bay
> windows, and are staggered up the city\'s hills. Some of the most
> over-the-top designs and extraneous details were ridiculed in their
> own time, it should be noted.

> \"It seems somehow cruel that many Victorians with intact interiors,
> that survived earthquakes, fires and hippies are having their stuffing
> ripped out so that the new owners can have a house that looks like a
> condo in Foster City,\" said Christopher VerPlanck, principal of
> VerPlanck Historic Preservation Consulting in San Francisco. \[\...\]
>
> Many owners want to create open floor plans, just like their tech
> offices, a design which is in sharp contrast to the narrow Victorian
> layouts of the late 1880s and early 1900s, which comprise many small
> rooms, each with their own fireplaces and heavy pocket doors, designed
> to keep in the heat.
>
> \"I have to ask why they seem to target Victorians when there are lots
> of more contemporary buildings that they could \[apply\] this
> treatment to,\" VerPlanck added. \"When the remodel is done, often the
> only thing left is the facade, which they may or may not do a nice job
> of restoring. \... As more of these happen, San Francisco is turing
> into a Potemkin Village of itself. No history. No patina. Nothing is
> lived-in. Everything looks like a Dwell magazine spread.\"
