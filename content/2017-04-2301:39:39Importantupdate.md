> Mr Britton said he raised his chainsaw and met the lion head-on as it
> pounced - a collision he described as feeling like a grown man running
> directly into him.
>
> \"It batted me three or four times with its front paws and as quick as
> I hit it with that saw it just turned away,\" he told the Associated
> Press.
>
> The wounded animal retreated after Mr Britton inflicted a six to
> eight-inch gash on the lion\'s shoulder. Mr Britton was left with only
> a small puncture wound on his forearm.
>
> \"You would think if you hit an animal with a chainsaw it would dig
> right in,\" he said. \"I might as well have hit it with a hockey
> stick.\"
