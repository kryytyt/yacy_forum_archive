[Nato Green: \"Mayor Ed Lee, I found locations for the 30,000 units you
want to build. They\'re in the
408.\"](http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/stop-being-bullied-lets-sue-mountain-view/Content?oid=2917759)

> San Francisco lets Silicon Valley push it around like the school bully
> in an \'80s teen comedy. We\'re at each other\'s throats trying to
> cope with soaring housing costs, while Silicon Valley gets off
> scot-free for creating problems we get to solve.
>
> Local governments dump housing problems onto the places that do build,
> mostly San Francisco and Oakland. For example, late last year,
> Mountain View approved plans to add 3.4 million square feet of office
> space around the Google and LinkedIn fortresses, adding 20,000 jobs.
> No new housing. Supposedly the newly elected City Council eventually
> will vote to allow 1,500 to 5,000 units in the area, but the other
> 15,000 are San Francisco\'s problem by default.
>
> Sunnyvale, Milpitas, Palo Alto, Santa Clara and all these tedious
> South Bay hamlets debase themselves to offer tech titans expansion
> upon expansion to corporate campuses without any new housing. One UC
> Davis study suggested those cities have a combined below-market-rate
> housing deficit of 20,000 units. Mayor Ed Lee, I found locations for
> the 30,000 units you want to build. They\'re in the 408.
>
> San Francisco should sue Mountain View and the rest of these fools.
> San Francisco could challenge all these cities to adopt a Jobs-Housing
> Linkage Program like we did years ago, to comply with their own
> housing elements. Even to the point of bringing dreaded California
> Environmental Quality Act lawsuits against big office projects that
> don\'t mitigate the housing problems they send us.
>
> A relevant precedent is Urban Habitat v. the City of Pleasanton. State
> law requires local governments to adopt a housing element with
> land-use regulations to meet local housing needs. Pleasanton didn\'t
> comply with its own housing element and used a bunch of obscure zoning
> gimmicks to prevent new housing from being built, especially
> below-market-rate housing. Pleasanton lost in 2010 and had to rezone
> and allow more below-market-rate housing. San Francisco could adapt
> this approach to sue over the refusal to build in the deep south.
>
> We progressives are accused of being NIMBYs, of reflexively opposing
> higher density new development. I support lots of it. In Silicon
> Valley. Build all the market-rate housing you want down there. I\'ve
> been to Mountain View. There\'s nothing there worth preserving, except
> Taqueria La Bamba on Rengstorff Avenue. Their carnitas is the rapture.
> When I started stand-up, the bar Ron\'s Farmhouse in Mountain View had
> a weekly comedy night. That fetid hole of regret closed. Build a
> 50-story luxury condo tower there.
>
> The reason these adorable towns resist more housing is basically
> racism. It\'s in the guise of alarms about \"preserving neighborhood
> character,\" \"school overcrowding\" and \"crime,\" but that\'s all
> code for poor brown people. They moved to a subdivision in 65 percent
> white Palo Alto to enjoy good schools and make little James Francos in
> peace. Fine!
>
> South Bay: You left a lot of your rich white people here in San
> Francisco. Please come collect them. In San Francisco, we\'re upset
> about the displacement of working-class communities of color. You can
> preserve your historic landmark whiteness and we\'ll happily welcome
> \"those people\" here. Bring your people home. That\'s a win-win.
>
> I know the techies in San Francisco feel embattled and beleaguered.
> They\'re blamed for things that are out of their control. I\'m here
> for you, Google Bus riders. I\'m concerned that all the hours you
> spend commuting are bad for your health. I want you to live close
> enough to bike to work. Santa Clara and Sunnyvale are both
> \"All-America Cities.\" There\'s a sign on the freeway saying so. I
> don\'t know what that means, but I want you to have down time after
> work to find out. You deserve linguica from Neto\'s in Santa Clara.
> Help me help you.
