YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: Automated YaCy Docker image
============================================================

Date: 2016-07-03 17:56:34

After running continuously a YaCy Docker container for some weeks, I
have some more informations for anyone interested :\
- the way I configured the proposed YaCy image, with default Docker log
configuration and a YaCy instance in peer to peer mode, the log file for
the container grows up to some giga bytes in a week, eventually filling
all disk on a small host server. The problem is not YaCy log which is
correctly rotated, but Docker container log itself. To avoid this
problem you have to set some options (\--log-opt max-size and \--log-opt
max-file) when running the container. So I updated the
[Readme.md](https://github.com/luccioman/yacy_search_server/blob/docker/docker/Readme.md){.postlink}
to mention this.\
- I also added to the Readme.md an example procedure to upgrade the YaCy
Docker image.\
- Regarding Docker Hub automated build on commits, a simple daily
scheduled shell script checking YaCy main git repository commits [atom
feed](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commits/master.atom){.postlink}
and then eventually triggering build through docker Hub Trigger URL
seems to do the job.\
\
\@Orbiter, if you wish to merge these
[changes](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/pull/55){.postlink}
to main YaCy branch I think it could be a good idea before releasing
next version as it has no impact on YaCy source code itself.
