ovens. Steel deck versus stone deck. Does it matter?

We\'re trying to decide between
[this](http://www.kclcutsheets.com/PDF/DY%5CPIZ6.pdf) and
[this](http://www.peerlessovens.com/client_images/catalog19904/pages/files/2324P_Pizza_Deck_Oven_2014SpecSheet.pdf).
Almost everyone uses stone, but the steel one, while being slightly more
expensive, has better temperature controls, and the glass doors mean
leaking less heat when checking on progress.

The fact that we don\'t know of anyone locally who uses a steel deck
oven is not a sign in its favor, but I haven\'t heard coherent arguments
against them. Besides that. Which is not nothing.

I\'ll bet you guys know every bit as much about ovens as you do about
ffmpeg, right?
