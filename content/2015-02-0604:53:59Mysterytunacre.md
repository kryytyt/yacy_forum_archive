> But the Natural History Museum said that the head probably belonged to

> fish, entering through its gills and attaching itself to its host\'s
> tongue.

> \"I opened the top of the lid and saw a purply thing, a gut sack or
> intestine \-- then I turned it round and pushed it with a fork and saw
> it looking back at me,\" she told the Nottingham Post.
>
> \"It\'s got like a spiny tail along the bottom \-- it\'s quite grim.
>
> \"I dropped the fork, jumped back, screamed a bit and shouted for my
> nan to come and have a look.\"
>
> She added: \"I haven\'t shown it to the kids because they might get
> put off eating tuna.
>
> \"I just want to find out what it is and to make sure it doesn\'t
> happen to somebody else.
>
> \"I didn\'t set out to get compensation and I don\'t a want
> lifetime\'s supply of tuna!\"

> Mrs Butler\'s grandmother Susan Goddard, 69, said: \"It\'s a little
> red and has eyes, bright black, looking at you. We did manage to
> ascertain that it was dead.\"
