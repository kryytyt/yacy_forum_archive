Hey, dieses ganze Internet-Abschnorcheln, da schreibt man doch lieber
ganz altmodisch einen Brief. So mit Briefmarke und Briefkasten und Post
und so. [Oh warte, vielleicht doch lieber
nicht](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/us/monitoring-of-snail-mail.html?pagewanted=all):

> Mr. Pickering was targeted by a longtime surveillance system called
> mail covers, but that is only a forerunner of a vastly more expansive
> effort, the Mail Isolation Control and Tracking program, in which
> Postal Service computers photograph the exterior of every piece of
> paper mail that is processed in the United States --- about 160
> billion pieces last year. It is not known how long the government

> Together, the two programs show that snail mail is subject to the same
> kind of scrutiny that the National Security Agency has given to
> telephone calls and e-mail.

Krass.
