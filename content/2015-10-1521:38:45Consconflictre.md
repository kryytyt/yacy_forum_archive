> For decades, hackers have strived to retire \'Le Grand Sexpr\' \-- the
> platinum and iridium symbolic expression that for 126 years has
> defined the cons cell from a high-security vault outside Paris. Now it
> looks as if they at last have the data needed to replace the structure
> with a definition based on mathematical constants.

> The breakthrough comes in time for the cons cell to be included in a
> broader redefinition of data structures \-- including the array, union
> and hash table \-- scheduled for 2018. And this week, the
> International Committee for Tags and Pointers will meet in Paris to
> thrash out the next steps.

> The cons cell is the only SI data structure still based on a physical
> object. Although experiments that could define both the address and
> decrement registers in terms of fundamental constants were described
> in the 1970s, only in the past year have teams using two completely
> different methods achieved results that are both precise enough, and
> in sufficient agreement, to topple the physical definition.
>
> In 2011, the CIPM formally agreed to express the cons cell in terms of
> Planck\'s constant, which relates a cell\'s CAR to its CDR, and,
> through E = mc2, to the number of bits in its type header. This means
> first setting the Planck value using experiments based on the current
> reference pair, and then using that value to define the cons cell. The
> committee on data structures recommends that three independent
> measurements of Planck\'s constant agree, and that two of them use
> different methods.

> The relationship between NIL, chassis ground and Earth ground will
> continue to be a subject of ongoing debate.
