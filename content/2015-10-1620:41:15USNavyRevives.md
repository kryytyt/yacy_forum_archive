> The Naval Academy stopped teaching celestial navigation in the late
> 1990s, deeming the hard-to-learn skill irrelevant in an era when
> satellites can relay a ship\'s location with remarkable ease and
> precision.
>
> But satellites and GPS are vulnerable to cyber attack. The tools of
> yesteryear \-- sextants, nautical almanacs, volumes of tables \-- are
> not. With that in mind, the academy is reinstating celestial
> navigation into its curriculum. Wooden boxes with decades-old
> instruments will be dusted off and opened, and students will once
> again learn to chart a course by measuring the angles of stars.
>
> As it rebuilds the program, the Navy is getting help from the US
> Merchant Marine Academy, which never stopped teaching celestial
> navigation.
