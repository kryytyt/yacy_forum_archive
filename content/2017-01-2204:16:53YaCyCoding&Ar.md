I was unaware of the existence of htroot/yacy/ui/\* ; I\'ll look at it
and see if it\'s a good fit for Javascript re-sorting.\
\
The algorithm used for re-sorting in Javascript isn\'t particularly
complex; all it does is look at the score returned for each result
(using the existing \"ranking\" field in the YaCy JSON API) and inserts
each result into the HTML DOM so that the results are in descending
score.\
\
I think it\'s probably impossible to have the sorting done solely
server-side, unless we\'re willing to accept inaccurate sorting or
significant delay in getting the results. This is because different
peers return results with different latencies \-- unless you can re-sort
client-side, you have to live with a tradeoff on the server-side between
low latency and accurate sorting.
