English â€¢ Please enable HTTPS on the YaCy website
=================================================

Date: 2017-07-07 10:47:20

(I already tried to make this request via Twitter, but didn\'t seem to
get a reply, so I guess I post here\.....)\
\
It\'s really unfortunate that a privacy-valuing project like YaCy
doesn\'t support HTTPS on its website. Let\'s Encrypt is gratis, and is
really easy to set up \-- it took me something like 30 minutes to set up
Let\'s Encrypt for the first time on a server I use. I\'ve already been
MITMed once by a Tor exit relay while visiting the YaCy website (it
redirected me to a phishing page); I don\'t even want to know how many
more subtle MITM\'s I\'ve been subjected to due to the lack of HTTPS.\
\
Can this please be rectified? I know YaCy is primarily a volunteer
project; if time budget is a problem I\'m happy to throw circa \$20 USD
at YaCy as a bounty to cover the time required to enable HTTPS.\
\
Cheers!
