Hi there,\
\
is there a way of having yacy boost results coming from different
domains? I.e. often the top 10 results are from wikipedia, is there a
way of telling Yacy to return just 1 result from each domain (or to
demote \"similar\" results and show them further down the list, much
like Google does)?\
\
Other options I couldn\'t find: is there a way of
[excluding]{style="font-weight: bold"} results from a particular domain
or with a certain extension? I.e. something like Google\'s
-site:www.domain.foo and -filetype:pdf options?\
\
Thanks,\
Eros
