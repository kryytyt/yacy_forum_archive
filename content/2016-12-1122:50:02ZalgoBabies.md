\"But how does he smell?\"\
\"Horrible.\"

I can confirm that Eva Green is my least favorite Charles Xavier thus
far, having now watched *\"Miss Peregrine and the Forgettable Title\"*,

First of all, the time travel cosmology made *no damned sense*. When
they wind it back, the house and grounds reset to an earlier
configuration (thus, no bomb) and presumably the physical bodies of the
kids also reset, which is why they don\'t age. But it doesn\'t wind back
their physical position, or their memories.

So that means that these aren\'t kids, these are shut-ins in their mid
60s trapped in kids\' bodies during their *Groundhog Day* horror story,
a few of whom are trapped in the endless nightmare of puberty.

But it *does* wind back the position and memories of *squirrels*.

Who drew the chalk outline of the Supervamp on the lawn, and more
importantly when? Why didn\'t that reset? For that scene to make sense
it\... well, it.. no, there\'s just no way to make that scene make
sense. Auugh!

Also: they can communicate with the outside world. The phone works, they
can walk down to the pub. And the past can affect the future: the house
doesn\'t exist in a slow-time bubble of 1940 that exists in 2016, it is
literally still 1940. And they don\'t think to make a call or send a
telegram to prevent the death of Kindly Hitman Grampa? They can try *as
many times as they want* until they get it right!

So then they finally save Kindly Hitman Grampa (ooh, spoilers) which
leaves the kid with no justification for having left the US in the first
place. And what ridiculous mess was left behind in Grampa\'s memories,
anyway? *You have to explain these things.*

In short, this movie sucked.

Fucking time travel.

It could have just been about Zalgo Babies fighting Supervamps or
whatever, but they had to go and rub *time travel* all over it too.
