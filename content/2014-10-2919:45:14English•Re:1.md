English â€¢ Re: 1 of 2 identical machines is incredibly slow

Hello,\
well, we have planned to continue using YaCy. There are no plans or
interest in going somewhere else as there are security functions in it
we feel are important.\
as you know, however, the update from yesterday has trashed both of our
servers.\
YaCy version 1.81/9116 causes a critical and complex failure documented
by the error notices / logs at the other forum address.\
[viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5429](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5429){.postlink-local}\
\
So now we need serious help to fix this.\
Who knows how to fix, bypass, work around or whatever to repair this
mess, please?\
Both servers were effected immediately.\
Both show the illogical peer notice.\
interestingly, the key message never seen before in our use of this is\

> <div>
>
> \
> The peer must go online to get a peer address.\
>
> </div>

\
As they were never set up as peers, this is very strange.\
These are Robinson servers that read each other but do not write to each
other\
\...precisely to avoid the chance that one sick server will infect the
other.\
However, as we can see a bug in the update applied to both has caused
the massive dual failure.
