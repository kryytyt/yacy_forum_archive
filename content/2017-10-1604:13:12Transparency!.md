> Social media analyst Jonathan Albright got a call from Facebook the
> day after he published research last week showing that the reach of
> the Russian disinformation campaign was almost certainly larger than
> the company had disclosed. While the company had said 10 million
> people read Russian-bought ads, Albright had data suggesting that the
> audience was at least double that \-- and maybe much more \-- if
> ordinary free Facebook posts were measured as well.
>
> Albright welcomed the chat with three company officials. But he was
> not pleased to discover that they had done more than talk about their
> concerns regarding his research. They also had scrubbed from the
> Internet nearly everything \-- thousands of Facebook posts and the
> related data \-- that had made the work possible.

> Never again would he or any other researcher be able to run the kind
> of analysis he had done just days earlier.

> Twitter pledged to do better in such situations, noting \"we will be
> clearer about these policies and decisions in the future.\"
>
> For close observers of Twitter\'s opaque harassment rules and its
> inconsistent enforcement of them this is a familiar dance. That\'s
> because Twitter wants everyone to know it is committed to
> transparency. It is also committed to committing to being committed to
> transparency.
>
> Twitter was committed to transparency last month when it refused to
> clarify its stance toward president Donald Trump\'s tweets about North
> Korea, which the country said it viewed as an \"act of war.\"
>
> Twitter affirmed its commitment to transparency 4 times last month in
> a blog post summarizing its Russian election interference testimony
> before congress. Sen. Mark Warner described Twitter\'s presentation as
> \"inadequate\" in almost every way.
>
> In January of this year, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey pledged to be more
> open and transparent about addressing the company\'s decade long
> battle with systemic harassment on its platform.
>
> This summer \-- despite reports that repeat harassment victims were
> still finding their abuse reports wrongly dismissed \-- Twitter
> affirmed its commitment to greater transparency.
>
> That same month, when BuzzFeed News presented the company with 27
> explicit examples of harassment, Twitter replied with its boilerplate
> statement. And company co-founder Biz Stone promised the company would
> be more transparent.
>
> This is likely because Twitter has a history of committing to being
> more transparent.
>
> Like in 2015, when Dorsey apologized to developers for Twitter\'s past
> restrictions of third-party apps and pledged to be more transparent.
>
> Similar to the kind of transparency the company promised in 2015 when
> Twitter began making federal campaign contributions.
>
> Transparency, you see, is part of Twitter\'s 10-year plan.
>
> But Twitter is committed to openness and clarity. Pledging a
> commitment to transparency is one of the things Twitter does best.
>
> Perhaps that\'s because the company has been doing it since 2008.
