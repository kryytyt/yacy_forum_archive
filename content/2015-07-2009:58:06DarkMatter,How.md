Dark Matter, Howard the Duck
============================

*Dark Matter* is the worst thing I\'ve ever seen on television in at
least six months. Let\'s take that one hallway set from Stargate
Atlantis, call up Central Casting for some cheap knock-offs of the cast
of Firefly, but wait, then let\'s give them all amnesia, *Space
Amnesia!* Oh, and by episode three we\'ve already trotted out *Space
Zombies*. And rub it all with extra Canadian. So much Canadian.
(Including: the boring doctor girlfriend from Lost Girl plays a robot,
doing her best Data impression but just looking really depressed/sad
about it.)

On the other hand, the Marvel Team-Up with Howard the Duck and Doctor
Strange is pretty much the greatest thing ever. Howard the Duck is
officially the best thing in comics right now.
