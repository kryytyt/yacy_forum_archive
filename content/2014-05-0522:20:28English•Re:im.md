English â€¢ Re: impossible te open an administration page
=======================================================

Date: 2014-05-05 22:20:28

Hi,\
\
I have the same problem, but in my case I have installed the current
version (available in your site) in a Ubuntu 14.04 headless
server/OpenJDK-6-JRE.\
\
The symptoms are exaclty the same as jihell\'s.\
\
I executed the passwd script and apparently it ran ok, stating that the
password for admin user had been reset to \'\'.\
\
I then tried entering in the administrative page, first with a blank
passwd, then trying to set my own, but nothing, the same authentication
window would show up again.\
\
Can you help me on that?\
\
Thanks
