> fervent Nazi sympathizer, who frequently touted Hitler\'s virtues.
> Dressed in a starched white uniform and pointed nurse\'s hat, she
> arrived with a stash of gruesome German children\'s books, including
> the Victorian classic *Der Struwwelpeter,* that featured sadistic
> consequences for misbehavior ranging from cutting off one child\'s
> thumbs to burning another to death. The acquaintance recalled that the
> nurse had a commensurately harsh and dictatorial approach to child
> rearing. She enforced a rigid toilet-training regimen requiring the
> boys to produce morning bowel movements precisely on schedule or be
> force-fed castor oil and subjected to
> enemas.[\*](http://www.randomhouse.com/highschool/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307947901&view=excerpt)
