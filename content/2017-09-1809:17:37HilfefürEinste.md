Hallo,\
I also like this kind of apparently crazy idea!\
Alex, to answer you initial question, to my mind a feasible solution can
be to generate files of hosts lists and then feed your YaCy peer(s)
crawlers using the \"From File\" crawl start point with a depth of
zero.\
The hosts list could maybe generated using the relevant DNS queries\...\
\
Personally I experimented this way of crawling by fetching official
websites URLs referenced in Wikidata. This represents already a rather
large number to play with (712518 at the moment I am writing), so I
limited each file to max 100 000 hosts each, and it worked rather fine
(less than one week to terminate the crawl).\
\
Best regards
