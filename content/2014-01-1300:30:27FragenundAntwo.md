So, then we are on point where we approve, that (maybe) good solution
will be a tunnel to my \'main\' YaCy server?\
Also, as I seed - target vm will be 5GB file at the start and will be
same for all clients.\
\
I will really appreciate if YaCy developers helps to create this vm
image. Also I have space on my ftp to keep it (always you can use
torrent to upload it, as it is not a commercial/closed software).
