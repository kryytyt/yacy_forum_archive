I retried in Robinson mode with \"allip\" network config and with the
same parameters as yours and still had no error. To be sure, tomorrow I
will retry on windows with YaCy 1.90/9000\...\
\
Looking rapidly for the error \"exist-test failed\" in source code, it
looks like YaCy has a problem accessing your Solr index when checking if
the url has already been crawled. Did you tried after restarting your
YaCy peer? And does basic crawl (/CrawlStartSite.html) works?\
\
The peer I run is in a Docker container on a VPS, and has this version
because is automatically built from latest sources on the main YaCy git
repository. You can find it on [Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/luccioman/yacy/){.postlink}.\
\
If you really want the very latest changes running on Windows, I am
afraid you will have to build it yourself from latest sources, or wait
for a new official build made available on <http://kaskelix.de/update/>,
by Orbiter I guess.
