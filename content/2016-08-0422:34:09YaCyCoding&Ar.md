YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ AJAX/AJAJ dynamic web page crawling
================================================================

Date: 2016-08-04 22:34:09

Since october 2015 google officially announced that they are able to
crawl dynamic AJAX/JSON-driven web pages without any extra work from web
page administrators because their crawler is able to read dynamic web
pages in the same way as web browsers do:\

I thought it may be really difficult to do so for us as well. But just
recently I had a look for headless browser frameworks and I found
[htmlunit](http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/){.postlink} - in a very
simple test I was able to run this tool and get full DOM-enriched
content from AJAX-driven web pages.

That means we have the opportunity to get better crawled content. I am
currently investigating opportunities to create a new crawler based on
that.\

As there is a plan to create a \'YaCy2\' made out of single components
(see kaskelix.de) the \'new\' crawler using htmlunit could become one
first of such components.
