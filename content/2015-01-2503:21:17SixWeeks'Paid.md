> WASHINGTON - President Obama\'s proposal to give workers six weeks of
> paid leave is meeting strong opposition from a group of people who
> annually receive thirty-three weeks of paid leave.
>
> Members of the group heard the President\'s proposal on Tuesday night,
> one of the few nights of the year when they are required to report to
> their workplace.
>
> The opponents of paid leave, who show up for work a hundred and
> thirty-seven days per year and receive paid leave for the other two
> hundred and twenty-eight, were baffled by other moments in the
> President\'s speech.
>
> For example, they were confused by Obama\'s challenge to try to
> survive on a full-time job that pays fifteen thousand dollars, since
> they all currently hold a part-time job that pays a hundred and
> seventy-four thousand dollars.
