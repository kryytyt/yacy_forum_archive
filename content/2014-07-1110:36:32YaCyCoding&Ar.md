YaCy Coding & Architektur â€¢ Yacy database schema?
=================================================

Date: 2014-07-11 10:36:32

Hi,\
I\'m building a piece of software (GPL of course) which builds on
certain elements of Yacy. In particular I am interested in the database,
which I gather is a NOSQL variant. Is the database schema (or whatever
it is called in NoSQL-land) published anywhere I can see it? I\'ve
searched the forums and wiki, but nothing has turned up, I wonder if
\"schema\" is the right word to use, or if that concept even translates
from relational to NoSQL databases?\
\
Cheers,\
\
Robin
