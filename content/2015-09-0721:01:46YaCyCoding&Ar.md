YaCy Coding & Architektur â€¢ Translator refactoring
==================================================

Date: 2015-09-07 21:01:46

Hello, last weeks I began working on french translation files and to my
opinion there is a big issue in the Translator system that could be
quite easily improved : the fact that keys in \'.lng\' locale files are
processed as regular expressions. For a non developer and indeed for
everyone its quite annoying and error prone : each time a label to
translate contains one of the characters used to build regular
expressions (like (, {, \*\...) it have to be escaped or strange
behavior may occur during translator processing. Looking deeply at
locale files, it seems that true regular expressions are not used.\
So I plan to replace regular expression processing in Translator class
by simple string search/replace and to remove escape chars in locale
files. I will validate this by generating translated files and making
diff with old files.\
Do you agree with the idea? Or maybe I missed something?
