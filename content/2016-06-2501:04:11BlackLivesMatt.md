> \"For us, celebrating Pride this year meant choosing between the
> threat of homophobic vigilante violence and the threat of police
> violence,\" said a statement from Black Lives Matter, an
> organizational grand marshal; Janetta Johnson, a community grand
> marshal; and sex worker advocacy group St James Infirmary, a
> \"Heritage of Pride\" award recipient.
>
> \"We had a tough decision to make, and ultimately we chose to keep our
> people safe by not participating in any event that would leave our
> communities vulnerable to either.\"
>
> On Tuesday, SF Pride announced that this year\'s events would have a
> \"significant police presence\" and that, for the first time in the
> celebration\'s 46-year history, attendees at the festival would be
> required to pass through security screening. The decision was made in
> the wake of the mass shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, in
> which 49 people were killed.
>
> Many LGBT people of color expressed concern with that news, citing the
> historic targeting and harassment of communities of color by police.
>
> \"I\'m more afraid of police than terrorists,\" Johnson, who is a
> black transgender woman, told the Guardian on Tuesday.

> Bringing in more police, especially undercover officers, is not the
> way to promote racial and economic justice.
>
> The history of pride is rooted in rioting against bigoted police and
> has been led by LGBT youth of color. And the LGBT people in this city,
> especially LGBT people of color, deal with regular profiling,
> discrimination and harassment by law enforcement.
>
> As we have seen time and time again, there are systemic problems
> within the SFPD that must be addressed. Increasing the number of
> officers on the streets will not only alienate and prevent people from
> coming to celebrate but may put those who do show up in danger.

> \"Only 50 percent of LGBTQI people of color believe the police would
> help them if needed, 46 percent of transgender respondents, and 40
> percent of transgender people of color shared that belief,\" according
> to the report. \"Respondents identifying as Native American or Middle
> Eastern are least likely to believe the police would help them if
> needed.\"
>
> While the SFPD promotes the message that San Francisco is a welcoming
> city for the LGBT community, it fails to point out the history of
> racism and bigotry within its ranks. This is the same police force
> that was recently in the news again when officers were exposed for
> exchanging racist and homophobic texts. This is the same police force
> that treats people of color as enemies and arrests black people in
> dramatically higher numbers. This is the same department that had its
> police chief dismissed because his officers continue to murder people
> of color in the streets. \[\...\]
>
> Cops in the clubs won\'t make people feel safer. And SF Pride should
> not be an excuse to over police the city\'s most vulnerable
> communities.
