[Facebook: Still Literally the
Worst](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/technology/facebook-censorship-tool-china.html?_r=4)

> The social network has quietly developed software to suppress posts
> from appearing in people\'s news feeds in specific geographic areas,
> according to three current and former Facebook employees, who asked
> for anonymity because the tool is confidential. The feature was
> created to help Facebook get into China, a market where the social
> network has been blocked, these people said. Mr. Zuckerberg has
> supported and defended the effort, the people added. \[\...\]
>
> Facebook does not intend to suppress the posts itself. Instead, it
> would offer the software to enable a third party \-- in this case,
> most likely a partner Chinese company \-- to monitor popular stories
> and topics that bubble up as users share them across the social
> network, the people said. Facebook\'s partner would then have full
> control to decide whether those posts should show up in users\' feeds.
> \[\...\]

\"*We* won\'t actually censor anything \-- we\'ll just give unfettered
access and control to the Chinese government.\"

> The suppression software has been contentious within Facebook, which
> is separately grappling with what should or should not be shown to its
> users after the American presidential election\'s unexpected outcome
> spurred questions over fake news on the social network. Several
> employees who were working on the project have left Facebook after
> expressing misgivings about it, according to the current and former
> employees. \[\...\]

\"Several Facebook employees discovered that they do, in fact, have
ethics, claim anonymous sources.\"

> Some analysts have said Facebook\'s best option is to follow a model
> laid out by other internet companies and cooperate with a local
> company or investor. Finding a partner \-- and potentially allowing it
> to own a majority stake in Facebook\'s China operation \-- would take
> the burden of censorship and surveillance off the Silicon Valley
> company. It would also let Facebook rely on a local company\'s
> government connections and experience to deal with the difficult task
> of communicating with Beijing.

\"When an American company wants to cave to the demands of a foreign
totalitarian regime, it always plays better in the media to do so
through a shell company.\"

[Facebook\'s descent into the rabbit hole of censorship is
suicidal:](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/23/facebook-china-censorship-is-a-huge-betrayal-commentary.html)

> But the intent here is the real problem. In the first place, it shows
> a decidedly broken moral compass. You know how they keep telling us
> that open and free trade and relations with totalitarian countries
> will someday soon lead to more freedom in those countries as its
> people become more and more exposed to our way of life?
>
> All of that goes out the window when the businesses and politicians
> trading and dealing with those countries agree to censor the things
> that make free society free in the first place. Facebook is guilty of
> this every time it agrees to erase even the evidence of American
> political free speech with censorship. Politicians are guilty of this
> every time a female American envoy agrees to ignore our firm belief in
> religious pluralism by donning a hijab when visiting even
> non-religious sites in a Muslim country. The list goes on, but the
> exchange of free ideas and principles is killed by these kinds of
> unjustified concessions and they destroy the very best reasons for
> international relations.
