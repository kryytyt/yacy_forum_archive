This is a description of the api at
http://localhost:8090/yacy/seedlist.html AND (it\'s the same) the format
of the YaCy bootstraping-seedlist. The seedlist has two representations:
a binary format which is used as bootstraping basis and a textual format
in json(p) representation.

If you call the seedlist with http://localhost:8090/yacy/seedlist.html
you will not get a html page but a page with encoded seedstrings as
described above. There is an alternative representation of the seed list
using the same api with json encoding. The page
http://localhost:8090/yacy/seedlist.json shows the seed DNA with all the
nucleotides in clear text. The same api is available for a json-p
encoding using the following schema:
http://localhost:8090/yacy/seedlist.json?callback=seedlistobject
