reject Trump unless he sells his business, top lawyers for Bush and
Obama
say:](https://thinkprogress.org/electoral-college-trump-top-lawyers-8a8b6e0ca916#.6hcz6l8az)

> Eisen\'s conclusions are shared by Harvard Law Professor Larry Tribe,
> one of the nation\'s preeminent constitutional scholars. Tribe told
> ThinkProgress that, after extensive research, he concluded that
> \"Trump\'s ongoing business dealings around the world would make him
> the recipient of constitutionally prohibited \'Emoluments\' from \'any
> King, Prince, or foreign State\'  \--  in the original sense of
> payments and not necessarily presents or gifts  \--  from the very
> moment he takes the oath.\"
>
> The only solution would be to divest completely from his businesses.
> Failing that, Tribe elaborated on the consequences:
>
> > Trump would be knowingly breaking his oath of exclusive fealty
> > (under Art. II, Sec.1) to a Constitution whose very first Article
> > (Art. I, Sec. 9)  \--  an Article deliberately designed to prevent
> > any U.S. official,especially the Chief Executive, from being
> > indebted to, or otherwise the recipient of financial remuneration
> > from, any foreign power or entity answerable to such a power  \--
> >  he would be violating as he repeated the words recited by the Chief
> > Justice.
>
> Tribe said the violation would qualify as one of the \"high Crimes and
> Misdemeanors\" that would require Trump to be \"removed from Office.\"
>
> This is where the Electoral College comes in. Tribe notes that the
> Electoral College was \"originally conceived by Framers like Alexander
> Hamilton as a vital safeguard against the assumption of the Presidency
> by an \'unfit character\' or one incapable of serving faithfully to
> \'execute the Office of President of the United States \[and\]
> preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United
> States.\'\"
>
> \"\[T\]o vote for Trump in the absence of such complete divestment\...
> would represent an abdication of the solemn duties of the 538
> Electors,\" Tribe said.

[Lawrence Lessig: The Constitution lets the electoral college choose the
winner. They should choose
Clinton.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-constitution-lets-the-electoral-college-choose-the-winner-they-should-choose-clinton/2016/11/24/0f431828-b0f7-11e6-8616-52b15787add0_story.html?utm_term=.de6cb29cdbb3)

> Conventional wisdom tells us that the electoral college requires that
> the person who lost the popular vote this year must nonetheless become
> our president. That view is an insult to our framers. It is compelled
> by nothing in our Constitution. It should be rejected by anyone with
> any understanding of our democratic traditions  \-- most important,
> the electors themselves. \[\...\]
>
> Only twice in our past has the electoral college selected a president
> against the will of the people \-- once in the 19th century and once
> on the cusp of the 21st. \[\...\] In both cases, the result violated
> what has become one of the most important principles governing our
> democracy  \-- one person, one vote. In both cases, the votes of some
> weighed much more heavily than the votes of others. Today, the vote of
> a citizen in Wyoming is four times as powerful as the vote of a
> citizen in Michigan. The vote of a citizen in Vermont is three times
> as powerful as a vote in Missouri. This denies Americans the
> fundamental value of a representative democracy \-- equal citizenship.
> Yet nothing in our Constitution compels this result.
>
> Instead, if the electoral college is to control who becomes our
> president, we should take it seriously by understanding its purpose
> precisely. It is not meant to deny a reasonable judgment by the
> people. It is meant to be a circuit breaker \-- just in case the
> people go crazy.
>
> In this election, the people did not go crazy. The winner, by far, of
> the popular vote is the most qualified candidate for president in more
> than a generation. Like her or not, no elector could have a good-faith
> reason to vote against her because of her qualifications. Choosing her
> is thus plainly within the bounds of a reasonable judgment by the
> people.
>
> Yet that is not the question the electors must weigh as they decide
> how to cast their ballots. Instead, the question they must ask
> themselves is whether there is any good reason to veto the people\'s
> choice.
>
> There is not. And indeed, there is an especially good reason for them
> not to nullify what the people have said  \-- the fundamental
> principle of one person, one vote. We are all citizens equally. Our
> votes should count equally. And since nothing in our Constitution
> compels a decision otherwise, the electors should respect the equal
> vote by the people by ratifying it on Dec. 19.

[Make the Electoral College great again: let \"conscientious electors\"
do their
jobs.](http://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2016/11/29/13771920/electoral-college-faithless-electors-independent-trump)

> First, let\'s retire the nomenclature of \"faithless electors\" once

> Constitutional history makes clear that the founders had three main
> purposes in designing the Electoral College.
>
> The first was to stop a demagogue from becoming president. At the
> Constitutional Convention, arguing in support of the Electoral
> College, Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts said he was \"against a
> popular election\" for president because the people would be \"misled
> by a few designing men.\" In Federalist No. 68, Alexander Hamilton
> wrote that the electors would prevent those with \"Talents for low
> intrigue, and the little arts of popularity\" from becoming president.
> They would also stop anyone who would \"convulse the community with
> any extraordinary or violent movements.\"
>
> The second goal was to stop foreign interference in election. In the
> founding period, the framers were extremely concerned about
> infiltration by rivals including Great Britain. In Federalist No. 68,
> Hamilton wrote that one major purpose of the Electoral College was to
> stop the \"desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in
> our councils.\" He said that the college would \"Guard against all
> danger of this sort \... with the most provident and judicious
> attention\" from the electors.
>
> The third goal was to prevent poor administration of government. This
> is a less well-known purpose of the Electoral College, but it is again
> expressly discussed in Federalist No. 68. Hamilton wrote that \"the
> true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce
> a good administration,\" and for that reason, he said, the electors
> should be \"able to estimate the share which the executive in every
> government must necessarily have in its good or ill administration.\"

> Let\'s review: We have a president-elect who:
>
> 1.  Will end up having received around 2.5 million fewer votes than
>     his main opponent.
> 2.  Whose campaign benefited, almost no one now disputes, from the
>     help provided him by Russian intelligence agencies and other even
>     more shadowy Russian actors \-- which is to say that foreign
>     agents, whether Russian or any nationality, sought to influence
>     this election to an unprecedented degree.
> 3.  Who is so tied up in compromises and conflicts because of his
>     business dealings that past White House ethics lawyers, including
>     at least one Republican one, say he will be in violation of the
>     Constitution from his first day in office and argue that the
>     Electoral College must not seat him.

>     Nixon declared the president to be by the very nature of the
