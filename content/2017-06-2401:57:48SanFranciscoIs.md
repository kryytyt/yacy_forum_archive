a profile of a landlord who went to jail for trying to hire someone to
burn down his apartment

> The numbers cited by Campos and others \-- 45 fires in two years \--

> reason that arson is on everyone\'s mind: While the number of fires
> has stayed steady, the value of the real estate in question has not.
> The 27 fires that burned in the Mission in 2006 caused \$2.6 million
> in damage; the 22 fires in 2015 caused almost \$15.6 million in
