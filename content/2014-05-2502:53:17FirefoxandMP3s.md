Firefox and MP3s
================

Date: 2014-05-25 02:53:17

Dear Lazyweb, if you know why Firefox can no longer play the [DNA Lounge
audio archives](http://www.dnalounge.com/webcast/archive/), please let
me know.

Apparently [adding DRM is just
fine](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/mozilla-and-drm) but
continuing to be able to play MP3s is beyond the pale.
