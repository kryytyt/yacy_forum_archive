Sometimes I continue watching TV shows just so I can be angry at them.
It\'s probably not healthy.

**The Inhumans:** This show is garbage in just *so* many ways, but let
me call out a few items that particularly infuriate me.

-   **Drywall:**

    Here is what the ceiling in Crystal\'s room looks like, her room on
    the moon \-- *on the moon:*

    That\'s drywall! Studs 16 inches on center with recessed sockets! I
    can\'t look at that without seeing California Title 24 post-2013
    low-energy lighting standards. Now I realize this show has *no*
    budget, but come on. Even Dr. Who \-- Dr. Who in the *1970s* \--
    didn\'t cheap out this badly.

    Compare and contrast to this shot from the upcoming *Thor* movie:

    That\'s drywall and \$10 of paint, but it is *Kirby as Fuck!* Find
    the person who did that! They are already on your org chart! They
    probably work in your building!

    I mean, to be generous, at least her apartment\'s \"2015 Airbnb
    rental in the Financial District\" look does match her character\'s
    complete absence of personality.

-   **Lockjaw:**

    You have a show where one of the characters is an elephant-sized,
    teleporting, drooling bulldog. *How is this not the star of the
    show?* More specifically, *how is this not the most charming thing
    in the world?* How did they manage to make Lockjaw boring? This is a
    *freebie*, how did you screw that up??

    Also, CGI bulldog, seriously? Wouldn\'t it have been cheaper to just
    composite in a real bulldog? If you did that it might have had some
    *personality* and not looked like it was half melted all the time.

-   **Medusa\'s Hair:**

    It\'s a given that Medusa\'s hair was going to be a disaster. It\'s
    an absolutely nonsensical, ridiculous idea, how can you even do that
    live-action without it being comedy? Also, it\'s an expensive
    effect! So they solved that problem by\... shaving her head for the
    whole season. *WHAT.* It\'s like the story Kevin Smith told about
    the Jon Peters *Superman* movie: \"I don\'t want to see him in that
    suit. No flying. And he has to fight a giant spider in the third
    act.\" Other than that, yeah, that\'s totally Superman, you\'ve
    nailed the essence of the character!

-   **Hot Librarian:**

    \"Have Central Casting send over a Scientistess!\" You know the
    character, she\'s wearing big black glasses but she hasn\'t taken
    the scrunchie out of her long, straight blonde ponytail yet, so you
    can\'t tell she\'s \"hot\". Is this actually the same actor playing
    Hot Librarian in *Arrow?* Because it\'s sure the same character, the
    same writing, and possibly decanted from the same clone vat. *Stop
    doing this.*

-   **\"Friend? What Is Friend?\"**

    They live in a secret city on the moon. They all speak perfect
    English, with only a slight Ren Faire accent. They know all about
    Earth, in particular, current events involving humans on Earth
    mutating. So they land on Earth, and now:

    -   They don\'t understand what money is.
    -   They think ATMs are speech-operated and just give it out for
        free.
    -   Somehow announcing that you are Queen of a *secret city* that
        *nobody on Earth has heard of* will convince the mean old ATM to
        comply.
    -   But! Medusa recognizes a helicopter by sight and calls it by the
        proper name.
    -   And thinks you can chase them with cars.
    -   Oh but Ramsay Bolton secretly owns a corporation? A secret
        Medical Research Murder Corporation? That just happens to be in
        the same place that everyone ended up.

    *HOW do you write this badly?* Does this show not even have a
    backstory written down? Seriously how do you fuck this up? Does your
    showrunner\'s wall not have any post-it notes on it at all?

    So which is it? Do they watch our TV, regularly receive shipments
    from Earth of drywall and UL-listed lighting fixtures? Or are they
    15th century
    [Brigadoon](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/12/brigadoon/) Monarchists
    recently emerged from their cave?

**Gotham:**

PS, speaking of stories where The City is (or should be) a primary
character, I\'m still sad and angry over the new *Blade Runner,* but I
haven\'t written down my massive list of grievances yet.
