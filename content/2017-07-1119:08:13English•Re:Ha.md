No I have not tried that it could be something to look into thanks.\
\
I plotted the top output overnight of java peak and the average loads of
my system see
<https://twitter.com/smokingwheels/status/868705075778117632>\
There is one result where the load of java goes near 1000 on a Quad core
CPU.\
I have noticed sometimes my swap drive goes full on. I can see this
because I am running Yacy on some old SCSI drives in Raid 0.\
On my old install I could put Ubuntu 14 in a death bash loop of doom and
had the average load at 140 using a quad core before the system was
hung.\
I have read that the average load ideally on a server should never go
above 0.7 per CPU under normal running to handle the transient loads.\
I found this on Ubuntu about swappiness
<https://sites.google.com/site/tipsandtricksforubuntu/system-tips/swappiness>
will have a look around as well.\

I read a while ago you can also change the priority the swap files if
you have more that 1 drive.
