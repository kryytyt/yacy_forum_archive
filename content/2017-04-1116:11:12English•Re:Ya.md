Thank you for your reply,\
\
Would that there were.\
\
Since OpenBazaar is open source; it would seem easy enough to trawl
through the code looking for some hook.\
\
But for me that is not the case. I have been searching high and low for
a solution.\
\
The last time that I looked, OpenBazaar had less than 300 Vendors. I
want to repeat a vendor search as that total number of vendors grows.\
\
I want to use YaCy to search the OpenBazaar NameSpace so that I might
have control instead of allowing search control to someone else.\
\
I have a great distrust of authority in all of its forms.\
\
Here is my little monkey story for illustration.\
\
Some good time ago using a tablet from my home ip address I searched
internet for \"hatay\" using a search engine provided by one of the
largest companies in the world.\
\
I know that word \"hatay\" very well and I knew what I was looking for.
The search returned more than several million results. So I skimmed
through 30 pages of results; to see who was reporting what.\
\
On that same day at a friend,s house using my same tablet via my
friend\'s ip address (same Internet service provider ) I searched for
\"hatay\" and got different results. I was somewhat surprised and I
studied the listing closely.\
\
Later at my home a search for \"hatay\" gave me the same results that I
had seen five hours earlier. WTF !!! Being curious now, I fired up a TOR
browser and searched again.\
\
Lo and Behold; Different results for different ip addresses.\
\
That\'s my story and Im sticking to it.\
\
And so finally will having some sense of control over searching a small
space really make any difference?\
\
Maybe not; but I will think that it does.\
\
Stop me if you have heard this joke.\
\
A guy goes to the doctor.\
\
The doctor tells him that he has to give up smoking + drinking + sex.\
\
The guy asks \"Doctor will I live longer? \"\
\
The doctor says \"No you will not live longer, But you will think that
it is longer.\"\
\
\--Best Regards and thank you to the producers of YaCy-
