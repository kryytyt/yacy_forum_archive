Was passiert eigentlich, wenn ein paar Fundi-Moslems an einer Uni fÃ¼r
sich einen Safe Space reklamieren und dann einen eingeladenen Vortrag
einer feministischen Ex-Muslima per \"No Platforming\" verhindern? [Das
hier](http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2015/12/islamist-students-try-to-disrupt-ex-muslim-maryam-namazies-talk-on-blasphemy-at-goldsmiths-university):

> Protesters from the Goldsmiths University Islamic Society have heckled
> and aggressively disrupted a talk from ex-Muslim and feminist
> campaigner Maryam Namazie.
>
> Ms Namazie was giving a speech on blasphemy and apostasy at the
> invitation of the Atheist, Secularist and Humanist Society at
> Goldsmiths University when several men from the Goldsmiths Islamic
> Society (ISOC) arrived and started disrupting the event.

> \[...\]
>
> The Islamic Society claimed that Namazie\'s attendance on campus was a
> violation of their \"safe space\".
>
> \[...\]
>
> **Incredibly, the Goldsmiths Feminist Society sided with the Islamist
> protesters**. They released [a

> on 2 December expressing their \"solidarity with Goldsmiths Islamic

>
> They said: \"We support them in condemning the actions of the Atheist,
> Secularist and Humanist Society and agree that hosting known
> islamophobes \[sic\] at our university creates a climate of hatred.\"
