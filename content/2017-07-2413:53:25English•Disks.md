English â€¢ Disk space problem
============================

Date: 2017-07-24 13:53:25

Hi there,\
\
I\'ve been running Yacy for a couple of months now and the index got
pretty big (about 20 million documents). I don\'t want to delete the
documents, but the index size is getting out of hands in terms of disk
space: the \"SEGMENTS\" directory takes up more than 400 GB.\
\
In my early tests with yacy, I seem to recall that when I exported the
index and then re-imported it in another yacy installation (on a
different machine), the index size was considerably smaller in terms of
disk space, is that possible?\
\
I was toying with the idea of:\
\
- exporting the index to an XML file\
- emptying the \"SEGMENTS\" directory\
- re-importing the index\
\
So here\'s my questions:\
\
a) do you think I\'ll get the result I expect (i.e. reduce the amount of
disk space taken up by the index)\
b) is there a better way of doing this?\
\
Thanks,\
Eros
