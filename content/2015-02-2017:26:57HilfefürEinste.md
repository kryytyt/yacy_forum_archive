HI,\
Problem\
We have 2 Robinson type cloud servers that must be replaced\
Saving the harvested data from each crawler is CRITICAL\
The data in them is different. The crawlers had different tasks.\
\

\
We need to recover the folders with the harvested data. This is
essential.\
1. What folders do we need to \"save\" and\
2. What do we move it to\...\'where,\' please?\
We can make new generic crawlers in another cloud space.\
Our goal is to add these harvested data to a private \[P2P/DHT
environment\]\
However, all the new servers are Robinson servers, that read each other,
at this time\
\
Many thanks
