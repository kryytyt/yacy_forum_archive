YaCy Coding & Architecture • Re: Java Web Start launch alternative
==================================================================

Date: 2016-03-31 07:16:40

I was initially thinking that embedding htroot resources in yacycore jar
could be a performance issue when running YaCy from tar.gz distribution
but my last tests seem to show it is not a problem.\
So I pushed on my git branch some fixes and changes to make ant
compiling and maven tgz distribution packaging consistent with new
all-in-one runnable jar package.\
\
Now last remaining points to check are other ant tasks
(\"copyMain4Dist\", \"installonlinux\"\...), OS specific installers
packaging and running, and merging last changes from main branch.
Personally I am only sure to have time to do this from next Monday, but
of course you can already do it on your own.
