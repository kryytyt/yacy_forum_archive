Hi Andreas,\
\
a) according the docs and my experience the less the count of segments,
the better will be the performance - but I didn\'t really benchmark
that\
b) there was such a feature,but we decided to remove that, because solr
does its job during merge better than an optimize after crawls\
A manual Optimize is usefull only when a change was done at index, like
removing Fields or deleting a lot of documents.\
