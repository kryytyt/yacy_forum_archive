> In fact, some in the Capitol are trying to defund the 15-year-old

Three! A whopping *three!*

> The biggest financial need is replacing voting machines. Flush with

> \"That kind of gear you usually figure should have a lifespan of eight
> years, maybe 10,\" said Menzel, of the Illinois election board. \"Most

> Moreover, election security experts say these aging machines are

> paper trail make it impossible to check the results against a physical
> vote count. At least four competitive states in the 2016 election
> still used paperless electronic voting machines. \[\...\]

> Election security experts and many Democrats fear that all this

[Russian Election Hacking Efforts, Wider Than Previously Known, Draw
Little
Scrutiny:](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/us/politics/russia-election-hacking.html)

> The assaults on the vast back-end election apparatus \--
> voter-registration operations, state and local election databases,
> e-poll books and other equipment \-- have received far less attention
> than other aspects of the Russian interference, such as the hacking of
> Democratic emails and spreading of false or damaging information about
> Mrs. Clinton. Yet the hacking of electoral systems was more extensive
> than previously disclosed, The New York Times found. \[\...\]
>
> Intelligence officials in January reassured Americans that there was
> no indication that Russian hackers had altered the vote count on
> Election Day, the bottom-line outcome. But the assurances stopped
> there. Government officials said that they intentionally did not
> address the security of the back-end election systems, whose
> disruption could prevent voters from even casting ballots. \[\...\]
>
> The Russians shied away from measures that might alter the
> \"tallying\" of votes, the report added, a conclusion drawn from
> American spying and intercepts of Russian officials\' communications
> and an analysis by the Department of Homeland Security, according to
> the current and former government officials.
>
> The most obvious way to rig an election \-- controlling hundreds or
> thousands of decentralized voting machines \-- is also the most
> difficult. \[\...\] Beginning in 2015, the American officials said,
> Russian hackers focused instead on other internet-accessible targets:
> computers at the Democratic National Committee, state and local voter
> databases, election websites, e-poll book vendors and other back-end
> election services.
>
> Apart from the Russian influence campaign intended to undermine Mrs.
> Clinton and other Democratic officials, the impact of the quieter
> Russian hacking efforts at the state and county level has not been
> widely studied. Federal officials have been so tight-lipped that not
> even many election officials in the 21 states the hackers assaulted
> know whether their systems were compromised, in part because they have
> not been granted security clearances to examine the classified

> The January intelligence assessment implied that the Russian hackers

I can\'t believe I\'ve been posting about the pathetic state of voting
security for *fourteen years* now.
