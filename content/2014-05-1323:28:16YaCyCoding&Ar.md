YaCy Coding & Architektur â€¢ Re: Using YaCy with centralized storage
===================================================================

Hi,\
I meant suppose we have 4 different task in YaCy: crawling, indexing,
storing and retrieving. Assume we want to use YaCy for crawling, index
and storing. But we want to use our own portal for retrieving. My
question would be is there anyway API or client available for cached
page results and indexes from YaCy? Can we use any kind of database
connection for access to stored caches? If yes how?\
Regards.
