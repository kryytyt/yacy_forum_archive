English â€¢ YaCy version 1.81/9116 knocks servers off Adressing
=============================================================

Date: 2014-10-28 19:31:58

This afternoon we upgraded the latest patch YaCy version 1.81/9116 to
both systems we have.\
\
The result is that both of our Robinson mode servers are now reporting\
\

The peer must go online to get a peer address.

\
\
They are Robinson servers that read each other\'s DBs but do not write
to each other.\
\
Everything concerning external crawling and indexing and processing of
our RSS links that are programmed into our systems has now stopped.\
The DBs can be read, but no growth is possible.\
How do we fix this please?\
Thank you
