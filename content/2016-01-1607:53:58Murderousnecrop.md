> The photograph ran in Australian media along with commentary from
> photographer Evan Switzer to the effect that the larger of the three
> beasts was lovingly cradling the body of his fallen mate, or perhaps
> even lifting her head so she could see her child (at left) one last
> time.
>
> But the Australian Museum quickly weighed in with another
> interpretation of the image, with principal research scientist Dr Mark
> Eldridge saying the picture shows the standing male is in a state of
> sexual excitement and is \"trying to get a female to stand up so he
> can mate with her.\"
>
> Other commentators say that the male may well have been trying to mate
> with the female for some time and, along the way, caused the injuries
> that killed the animal.

> Australians were therefore asked to go from \"gosh, Kangaroos can be
> surprisingly tender\" to \"Male Kangaroos are violent sexual
> predators\" within a day.
