HTML parser : removed unnecessary remaining recursive processing

Recursive processing was removed in commit
67beef657f82e92f48dd8425073ad81896a2ff4b, but one remained for anchors
content(likely omitted from refactoring). It is no more necessary :
other links such as images embedded in anchors are currently correctly
detected by the parser.

More annoying : that remaining recursive processing could lead to almost
endless processing when encountering some (invalid) HTML structures
involving nested anchors, as detected and reported by lucipher on YaCy
forum ( http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=6005 ).
