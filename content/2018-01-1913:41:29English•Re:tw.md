English â€¢ Re: two YaCy ?
========================

Hi Fabrice,\
basically it can be quite simple. You simply need :\
- two separated install folders, or eventually two YaCy DATA folders\
- different binding ports for each instance :\
- http port can be configured in the Basic Configuration page
(/ConfigBasic.html)\
- https port can be configured in an Advanced settings page
(/Settings\_p.html?page=ProxyAccess) (a link to it is in the Basic
Configuration page)\
\
For the first setup of your second instance, of course you must first
shutdown the first one if it is listening on the default ports (8090 and
8443), otherwise you wouldn\'t be able to start this second instance on
the same ports. Then once the two instance are configured with different
ports, you will be able to (re)start the both simultaneously.\
\
For proper detailed instructions : it depends on your machine Operating
System, and which YaCy packaging flavor (cross-platform tar archive,
Debian package, Docker image, zip sources archive\...) and version
(stable or development) you would like to deploy.
