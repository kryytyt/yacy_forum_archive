I know its not recommend but you could manually tune the JAVA options
here is an example running a Minecraft server
<http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/alpha/alpha-survival-multiplayer/823328-making-your-server-lag-less-by-tuning-java>
there are plenty more to look at as well on other sites.\
\
36G freeworld/QUEUES is large your could split crawler lists up?\
I have such a program but you would need to run QB64 and know what to
change. <https://github.com/smokingwheels/loklak_split>.\
I could edit the program suit and add it to Github if needed.\
\
I think I have found a bug when the TOP setting the \"VIRT\" memory in
the JAVA process skyrockets (9m to 9.9 GB) is slows the crawler down no
end and there is nothing you can do.\
The Top \"VIRT\" got up to 14GB and a system shutdown was causing
constant Disk I/O for too long to where I hit the reset and started
again.\
\
I have also learned to restart yacy you perform a Shutdown of yacy,
pkill java if needed and actually turn machine off with shutting it down
in the normal manner and power up again.\
