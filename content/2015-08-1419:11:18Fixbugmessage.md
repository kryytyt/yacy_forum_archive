Fix bug message not attached to user https://github.com/loklak/loklak_webclient/pull/471

This is a part of bug fix mentioned in  https://github.com/loklak/loklak_webclient/pull/471 : message not attached to user. The cause is the screen_name value is overriden during conversion phase by stored conversion rules.

- All conversion rules that modify screen_name & user.screen_name must be removed.
- Assign screen_name parameter to message & user screen_name values
```
