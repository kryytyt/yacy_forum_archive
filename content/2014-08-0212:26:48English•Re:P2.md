I\'m not quite sure. I have never done this before. I think you have to
set the proper settings on the network configuration page:
<http://localhost:8090/ConfigNetwork_p.html>. Maybe you have to create a
custom network definition under \"Network and Domain Specification\".\

For my part, I have never heard of a minimum limit.
