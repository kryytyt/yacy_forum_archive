[The solution to the Voynich
manuscript.](https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/voynich-manuscript-solution/)

Alas, it\'s *prosaic* quackery, not even *interesting* quackery.

> By now, it was more or less clear what the Voynich manuscript is: a
> reference book of selected remedies lifted from the standard treatises
> of the medieval period, an instruction manual for the health and
> wellbeing of the more well to do women in society, which was quite
> possibly tailored to a single individual.
>
> The script had hitherto proved resistant to interpretation and
> presented several hurdles. Medieval lettering is notoriously fickle:
> individual letter variations, styles and combinations are confusing at
> the best of times. I recognized at least two of the characters in the
> Voynich manuscript text as Latin ligatures, *Eius* and *Etiam.*
> Ligatures were developed as scriptorial short-cuts. They are composed
> of selected letters of a word, which together represent the whole
> word, not unlike like a monogram. An ampersand is just such an
> example. \[\...\] Systematic study of every single character in the
> Lexicon identified further ligatures and abbreviations in the Voynich
> manuscript and set a precedent. It became obvious that each character
> in the Voynich manuscript *represented an abbreviated word and not a
> letter.* \[\...\]
>
> One other noticeable difference from the *Herbarium Apuleius
> Platonicus* is that not a single plant name or malady is to be found
> in the Voynich manuscript. This was problematic until I realized that
> not only had the folios of the manuscript been cropped (the images of
> flowers and roots have been severed and the tops of folios hacked)
> but, more importantly, the indexes that should have been there were
> now absent. Indexes are present in many other similar books: a system
> of cross-reference for illness, complaints, names of plants and page
> numbers. For the sake of brevity, the name of both plant and malaise
> were superfluous in the text so long as they could be found in the
> indexes matched with a page number. Recipes require an index to
> function in a reference book. The same recipe format is replicated
> throughout the manuscript: recipes for bathing solutions, tonics,
> tinctures, ointments, unguents, purgatives and fragrant fumigations
> \-- and not a name in sight. Not only is the manuscript incomplete,
> but its folios are in the wrong order \-- and all for the want of an
> index.
