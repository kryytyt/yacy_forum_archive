ah, yes the QPH is difficult to explain. As we constructed the feature,
we wanted to avoid that the real number of queries that a peer submits
in the P2P network is visible. If the number of queries is counted on
the local peer, it would be visible that these queries happend. Instead,
we count the number of queries at the remote peers. It works like this:\
\
- your peer makes a p2p query to X peers\
- within each query to remote peers, the remote peer gets the number X
of all queries peers submitted\
- the remote peer increases the number of queries in the local QPH
counter by 1/X\
- if we sum up the number of remote queries over all peers then X \*
(1/X) is added for each query Qn for n queries in the network, which
should result in the number n.\
\
This causes the strange number of QPH in your peer, because it does not
count the queries you made but just a summed-up fraction of queries
other made.
