[VEC9 is the first vector arcade game to be released in 30 years, the
only true 3d vector arcade game to be released besides Star Wars \-- and
the only one to let you smash capitalist aggression for the glory or
Mother Russia.](http://vec9.com/)

> The monitor originally started with a Craigslist whim \-- and ended
> with a custom designed, FPGA based vector video card, a gunner\'s
> control from an M1 Tank, a separate monochrome HUD, an air raid siren,
> and a fully functional ruble acceptor. It uses a salvaged Asteroids
> monitor. It trades color and speed for essentially infinite resolution
> and (monochrome) brightness.
>
> Nuclear-powered laser-armed bombers are stationed in orbit, their
> pilots cryogenically frozen to mask their heat signature. The iron
> curtain falls. Thirty years later, the last forgotten Soviet radio
> beacons sputter to a halt. Unable to re-establish contact with the
> non-existent Soviet Command, Station VEC9 has no choice but to assume
> that the USSR has been destroyed by capitalist deceit and nuclear
> fire.
>
> VEC9\'s mission: to avenge Mother Russia, to punish imperialist
> aggression, and to destroy tyranny and the American way of life for
> the safety of the Communist world.
