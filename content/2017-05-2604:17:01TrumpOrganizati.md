> Unfortunately, your meager response does not include the vast majority

> single document \-- a glossy, eight-page pamphlet that contains a
> total of 40 sentences \-- and an email forwarding this pamphlet to

> concerns about the President\'s refusal to comply with the
> Constitution merely because he believes it is \"impractical\" and
> could \"diminish the guest experience of our brand.\"

> Complying with the United States Constitution is not an optional
> exercise, but a requirement for serving as our nation\'s President.^2^
> If President Trump believes that identifying all of the prohibited
> foreign emoluments he is currently receiving would be too challenging
> or would harm his business ventures, his options are to divest his
> ownership or submit a proposal to Congress to ask for our consent.

> Even if the President\'s companies were willing to carefully track of
> all their foreign government payments, the President still would be
> required under the Emoluments Clause to request and obtain permission
> from Congress to accept those payments.
