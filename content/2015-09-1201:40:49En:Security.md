== Remote Administrative Access ==\
If you administrate your YaCy peer remotely you have to assign a
administrator username and password via the web interface (menu: Use
case & account -\> Accounts\
\
=== Consideration ===\
By default YaCy uses HTTP BASIC authentication which means that username
and password are transmitted unencrypted between the remote system and
you peer. You can setup YaCy to encrypt transmitted passwords (more
secure).\
\
==== Configure YaCy to use DIGEST ====\
\# copy file web.xml in directory ./defaults to ./DATA/SETTINGS\
\# locate the text \'\'\'\<auth-method\>BASIC\</auth-method\>\'\'\' in
the copied web.xml\
\# modify the line to \'\'\'\<auth-method\>DIGEST\</auth-method\>\'\'\'
and save it\
\# restart YaCy and assign a admin user password
