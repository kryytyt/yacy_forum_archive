His taste in music is deplorable, but it\'s a good hack.

I was interested in what he did to hook up the keypad, since that was
the hardest part of [my payphone
project](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/01/my-payphone-runs-linux-now/).
He says,

> The most critical part of this hack is to intercept the keypad.
> Thankfully the phones use a conventional 8pin-keypad-style circuit,
> which makes this extremely easy :)

\...and I\'m like, huh? But he went from the keypad directly into
Arduino GPIO pins, whereas I needed to go from there into a USB keyboard
decoder board, which had a flat plastic ribbon cable connector on it
instead of the spacious luxury of a molex connector with splicable
wires. Sigh.

Anyway, I am also slightly disappointed in both his project and mine
that in neither one does the original brass striker-arm telephone bell
ring. He just plays an MP3. I really ought to fix that.
