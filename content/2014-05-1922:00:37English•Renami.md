English â€¢ Renaming Yacy
=======================

Date: 2014-05-19 22:00:37

Hi,\
I find Yacy is written everywhere in the code. Even for images we can
fin the tag alt=Yacy.\
\
I wished to change it for my own logo. And I also wondered if there was
a way to change yacysearch.html to something more customized.\
I tried but got some errors and can\'t figure out what failed.\
Thanks.
