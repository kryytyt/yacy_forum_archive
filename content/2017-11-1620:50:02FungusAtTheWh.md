> David Hughes wants to know exactly how this puppet master controls its
> puppets \-- and his latest experiments suggest that it\'s even more
> ghoulish than it first appears. \[\...\]
>
> Hughes\'s team found that fungal cells infiltrate the ant\'s entire
> body, including its head, but they leave its brain untouched. \[\...\]
> Hughes thinks the fungus might also exert more direct control over the
> ant\'s muscles, literally controlling them \"as a puppeteer controls
> as a marionette doll.\" Once an infection is underway, he says, the
> neurons in the ant\'s body \-- the ones that give its brain control
> over its muscles \-- start to die. Hughes suspects that the fungus
> takes over.
>
> It effectively cuts the ant\'s limbs off from its brain and inserts
> itself in place, releasing chemicals that force the muscles there to
> contract. If this is right, then the ant ends its life as a prisoner
> in its own body. Its brain is still in the driver\'s seat, but the
> fungus has the wheel.
