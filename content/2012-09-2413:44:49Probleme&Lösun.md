Hi again.\
\
Unfortunately that does not work for me
![:(](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif "Sad")\
\
If I start with an empty queue and do a search my queue starts to fill
up and the node starts indexing pages (PPM meter rises), after a while
the PPM meter goes down to zero but the queue does not stop filling up.\
Looking at /IndexCreateQueues\_p.html?stack=LOCAL i can see depths of 30
or more, the queue even filled up so fast that I was unable to empty it
and had to manually delete the QUEUES dir after I stopped the node.\
I have enabled all Heuristics but that shouldn\'t really matter.\
\
Any ideas as to what could have gone wrong for me?\
