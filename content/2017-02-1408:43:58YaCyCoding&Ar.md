YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: Privacy and Referer http header
================================================================

According to caniuse.com, the referrer meta tag is indeed already
supported by [many
browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=referrer){.postlink}.\
\
It is far more flexible than the \"rel=noreferrer\" link attribute, and
would allow to easily (without much refactoring, using the
metas.template) set this policy not only for YaCy search results but for
any link to external. Personnally I think I would favor this over a
redirection solution.
