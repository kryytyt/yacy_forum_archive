English â€¢ Re: image search does not load all thumbnails
=======================================================

Thumbnails in YaCy are very different from what you know from other
search portals because they are not stored during indexing-time (other
search engines pre-calculate the thumbnails) and the tumbs are generated
at the very moment when the result page is shown. This can cause that
large images are loaded and resized or that no image at all is found for
some image links (dead image links). There are also web pages which
\'fake\' image urls (give the wrong mime type and/or have html pages
behind links that have a .jpg extension) which can not be identified
during indexing time because it would be necessary to load all the
images. That would not make sense for p2p search because people would
need to load images who never have a use of it.\
\
Therefore the image search is a bit \'incomplete\'. The handling of such
cases is actually not finished; it would be possible to hide such cases
from the user which is not done yet.
