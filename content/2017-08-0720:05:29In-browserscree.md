> After launching the emulator (ensuring that sound is unmuted), allow
> the Mac OS to boot and then\... do nothing. After one minute of
> inactivity, After Dark will kick in.
>
> This emulated Internet Archive item contains version 2.0 of After
> Dark, the software that kicked off the screensaver craze of the 1990s.
> Additionally, the expansions \"More After Dark\" and \"After Dark -
> Art of Darkness\" have been added to the install.
>
> Navigate to the After Dark control panel via the Apple menu where you
> can change to a different screensaver module, change settings for
> each, and demo them all without having to wait for a minute.

*I am particularly fond of GraphStat.*
