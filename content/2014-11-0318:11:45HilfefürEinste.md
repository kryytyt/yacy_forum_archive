Trying to answer my own question \"What signs should I look for?\", I
think these graphs give a hint:\

\
The monthly graph shows a clear decrease of free memory starting at the
end of week 43, exactly when I started the crawl on that huge web site.\
\
The yearly graph is definitive in showing that only in October the free
memory presented a significant decrease.\
\
So, are these graphs the ones that I should monitor to know when to
either stop crawling, stop Yacy and increase memory allocation (but this
is a limited option), or take whatever action needed that will allow to
adjust Yacy to a unusual burden on the fly?
