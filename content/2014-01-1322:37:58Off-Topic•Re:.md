I get your point.\
But IMHO this is a pretty bad decision.\
I say that because having multiple forums can segregate the community.\
Other downside for the \'multiple forums\' idea is that you can end up
with a half dead forum, and that can scare away new users.\
So, at the end of the day, I really don\'t see the reason to not have an
international section here.
