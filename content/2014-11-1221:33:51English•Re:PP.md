the robots.txt \"Crawl-delay\" feature uses integer values which means
seconds. I was not able to find a proper documentation for that which
says that this value is actually interger-only. During all the years I
have seen only integer values for Crawl-delay. That means a Crawl-delay
would make crawling even slower.\
\
If you would use non-integer values for Crawl-delay, then the current
parser would not recognize that and there is also no
below-hardcoded-adaption because there would be no need for that.
