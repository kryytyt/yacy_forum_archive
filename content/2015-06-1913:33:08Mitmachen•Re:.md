Yes, sometimes my Index was broken because of a power outage or a broken
harddrive. The Pre-Solr-Time, as YaCy used it\'s own data(base)structure
I often deleted the corrupted file. Since Solr found the way into YaCy
I\'m using the checkindex.sh found in the bin-directory. I currently
have over 200 million Documents but this Instance of Endeavour is
currenty shutdown because I\'m currently migrating an old Index of a
2012 backup of Endeavour to the new Solr Index. When it\'s done, I think
it\'s at the end of the year, I\'m exporting these documents with the
[great new feature](http://tinyurl.com/nnankgb){.postlink} developed by
Orbiter and import it in the 200 million documents Instance of
Endeavour. Since I got no software development skills at all, I\'m
currently searching for help to boost the migration process as mentioned
in the post above.\
