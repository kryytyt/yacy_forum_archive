> For centuries, painters and sculptors have depicted the act of
> urination. Men piss. Women piss. Most of all, young boys piss, so much
> so that scholars assigned a Latin term, *puer mingens*, to their
> ubiquitous appearances. Now Jean-Claude Lebensztejn, a French critic,
> has written *\"Pissing Figures, 1280 \-- 2014,\"* a genealogy of the
> *pisseurs* and *pisseuses* who haunt our canvases, fountains, and
> frescoes. The book, in a rangy, fluent translation from Jeff Nagy, is
> a record of what Lebensztejn calls our \"diuretic fantasies\" \-- of
> the lore and lust surrounding urine, sacred and profane. \[\...\]
>
> They pissed into vases and basins and shells and conchs, onto
> snowdrifts and poppy husks and flocks of cupids. They pissed in the
> mouths and anuses of other boys, who themselves pissed in more mouths
> still. These were no ordinary boys. Spritely and seraphic, often
> winged and laurelled, they charmed their way into old churches, where
> they patrolled the transepts and friezes, pure of heart and full of
> bladder. \[\...\]
>
> Indeed, a boy\'s piss seems at some point to have crossed streams with
> holy water, becoming blessed with ablutionary powers. In Italy,
> Lebensztejn notes, \"it is still customary, even today, to call an
> infant\'s intemperate pee *acqua santa.\"* \[\...\]
>
> Of course, the angels, being angels, feel no relief as they piss. They
> get their celestial jollies by raining a little holy water on us, but
> they know nothing of urination as a physical urge. If you want to
> enjoy some real salt-of-the-earth pissing, Lebensztejn reports, you
> have to skip ahead to 1600.

*Please, Jesus, please let the pee tape be real. Amen.*
