English â€¢ Re: Search for videos
===============================

When YaCy was created the was no youtube (creepy!) .. I admit that I
never tried to crawl youtube. YaCy can identify links to video files and
it provides a search option for this (you must switch on \"Video\" in
/ConfigSearchPage\_p.html ) but this is most probably not the right way
to catch links to youtube. Please give this a try, however I consider
this a problem to be solved as \'community portal scraping\' which is
implemented in loklak.org for tweets. We would need something similar
for yourtube, I guess.
