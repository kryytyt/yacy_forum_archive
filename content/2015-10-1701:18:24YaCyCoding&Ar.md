YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Commit 136e8f6 and 1-char queries
==============================================================

Thanks Orbiter for your continued efforts.\
\
I was having a glimpse at the latest commits and I found a dubious one:
commit
[c737ff2](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commit/c737ff235d240b5efef7d6a6681303c4b5a9e03e#diff-41ec5890f395f468c6376a3021d8ac5f){.postlink}
(source/net/yacy/search/query/QueryGoal.java @ line 187) shows that, by
now, if queries are composed of both multiple-chars strings and 1-char
strings, then all 1-char strings are stripped off the query.\
I never learned java and I don\'t know Yacy, so pardon me. But is this
new algorithm going to be unconditionally applied to every query, or is
it somewhat more selective / specific? In the first case, it would no
longer be possible to search for, eg, \"[Pentium
4]{style="font-style: italic"}\" or \"[OS
X]{style="font-style: italic"}\" or \"[The incredibles
4]{style="font-style: italic"}\".
