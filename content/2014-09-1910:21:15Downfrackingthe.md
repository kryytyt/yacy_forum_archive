> Downfracking had opened universe after universe of ever-more-pure
> resources. The farther downfractal you traveled, the simpler the
> universe and the more you tended to slide backwards along the time
> axis. Each fractal was a perfect copy, from a distance, but simpler,
> and because they were simpler, those resources had fewer contaminants.
> Water had less impurities. Diamonds, less inclusions. Hell even the
> shit smelled like roses\--well, not really, but that was the joke they
> all laughed at even though it wasn\'t funny anymore.
