Hi, maybe you can make use of
[cgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups){.postlink}. What\'s
more it is actually used by docker to control containers resources, and
also by
[Systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/ControlGroupInterface/){.postlink}
for example.\
\
For now I didn\'t really played with it, and I am not sure if is easier
to use it directly or to learn using Docker tools. At least cgroups is a
kernel feature, so it is surely not loosing time to learn using it\...\
\
PS : I experimented with YaCy on Docker recently and I think it is not
as complex as it may look. A
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/tree/master/docker){.postlink}
is even now on YaCy main repository, and is used to build a docker image
from latest YaCy sources
[here](https://hub.docker.com/r/luccioman/yacy/){.postlink}.
