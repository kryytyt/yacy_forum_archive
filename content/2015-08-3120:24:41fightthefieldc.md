``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
fight the fieldcache by usind DocValues: in Solr-5.x the fieldcache has
moved and was not cleared anymore. This results in an huge fieldcache.
(http://lucene.apache.org/#highlights-of-the-lucene-release-include
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-5666)
Here I try to use DovValues where it is possible.
For this I used the Api-Scheme as new basis f√ºr the Solr-Schema.
This needs at least a complete optimization of the Solr-Index to get a
smaller FieldCache.
Everything that is indexed with these setting will not use the
Fieldcache at all.
