YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: Extend Image preview formats support
=====================================================================

Hello, I just created a Pull Request
(<https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/pull/18>).\
For now I only added Tiff format support with twelvemonkeys library and
didn\'t use twelve monkeys jpeg, ico and bmp formats plugins as I was
not convinced by performance tests.\
More automated tests and eventually more file formats support to come
next weeks. Feedback is welcome.
