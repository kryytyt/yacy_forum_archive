Hey guys in Germany, congratulations for the World Cup!\
\
Nice campaign from the German team, deserved result from the work that
have been doing for years in the German football.\
\
Below, a photo from the classic Flamengo x Fluminense (Fla x Flu) in
1963, when Maracanã stadium (the stadium where you guys conquered the
Cup) reached its maximum capacity ever: 194,603 persons. (Since then,
the stadium has been reengineered and its current maximum capacity is
something around yesterday\'s decision, that is, 74,000.)\
