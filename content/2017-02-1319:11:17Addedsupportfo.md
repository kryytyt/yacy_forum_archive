Added support for HTML OpenSearch results.

Many OpenSearch systems do not provide results as standard RSS/Atom
feeds but only as HTML. 

This modification add some support for custom OpenSearch HTML results
through the use of mapping files (as already done for federated Solr
search) relying on CSS-like selectors to retrieve information from HTML
content.

An example mapping file is provided to map results from the
www.npmjs.com OpenSearch URL.
