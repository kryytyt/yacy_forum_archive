YaCy Coding & Architektur â€¢ Using YaCy with centralized storage
===============================================================

Date: 2014-05-11 11:52:06

Dear YaCy developers,\
Hi,\
I recently got familiar with YaCy. From what I saw, I think YaCy is
strong distributed crawler. But I want to make some changes to YaCy
based on my demands. As far as I found out YaCy uses a embedded storage
in each peers. Since I going to run a distributed local search portal
using YaCy I need to have a central database (Relational or NOSQL ones)
for all local peers. Could you please give me some hints about how that
is possible with YaCy?\
Regards.
