Curator has an
interview](http://hackerscurator.com/pages/interviews/crew.html?who=peterchiang)
with VFX supervisor Peter Chiang\... who still has \"The Gibson\":

> PC: We were very conscious of making the \"Hacking\" process visually
> exciting, not just lines of code, to allow the viewers who are not
> computer savvy to understand what is going on. We used all the
> available VFX processes, 2D, 3D, miniatures, matte paintings, motion
> control etc. to create the imagery.
>
> *HC: Perhaps this gave the ultimate leeway as many viewers wouldn\'t
> really be familiar with some of the concepts. What idea would was the
> hardest to flesh out regarding how to put imagery around an
> audience-unfamiliar concept?*
>
> PC: We loved the visual ideas of [Muriel
> Cooper](http://www.inventinginteractive.com/2010/02/01/information-landscapes/)
> and wanted to represent moving through a 3D database. So we designed
> the data towers and represented them as full CG and also built
> physical miniatures made out of perspex. I still have one.

He also still has Zero Cool\'s laptop!
