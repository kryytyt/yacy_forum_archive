watering hole campaign: An updated Firefox extension abusing
Instagram](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/06/turlas-watering-hole-campaign-updated-firefox-extension-abusing-instagram/)

> The extension uses a bit.ly URL to reach its C&C, but the URL path is
> nowhere to be found in the extension code. In fact, it will obtain
> this path by using comments posted on a specific Instagram post. The
> one that was used in the analyzed sample was a comment about [a
> photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/BO8gU41A45g/) posted to the Britney
> Spears official Instagram account.
>
> The extension will look at each photo\'s comment and will compute a
> custom hash value. If the hash matches 183, it will then run this
> regular expression on the comment in order to obtain the path of the
> bit.ly URL:
>
> `(?:\\u200d(?:#|@)(\\w)`
>
> Looking at the photo\'s comments, there was only one for which the
> hash matches 183. This comment was posted on February 6, while the
> original photo was posted in early January. Taking the comment and
> running it through the regex, you get the following bit.ly URL:
>
> `http://bit.ly/2kdhuHX`
>
> Looking a bit more closely at the regular expression, we see it is
> looking for either `@|#` or the Unicode character `\200d`. This
> character is actually a non-printable character called \'Zero Width
> Joiner\', normally used to separate emojis. Pasting the actual comment
> or looking at its source, you can see that this character precedes
> each character that makes the path of the bit.ly URL:
>
> `smith2155<200d>#2hot ma<200d>ke lovei<200d>d to <200d>her, <200d>uupss <200d>#Hot <200d>#X`
