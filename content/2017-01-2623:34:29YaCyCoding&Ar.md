After more debugging I found, differences in new calculated hash and
received hash happens. Not very frequent but one or two occurence
approx. during 4 to 5 searches (from different peers and versions).\
\
Most often it is only the difference in the last hash character coming
from hashing different protocols (http instead of the actual https) like
1st example\

Code: 
:   `newCalculated    received Hash                URL exampleZJRfs4eCdSU8 ZJRfs4eCdSU4  https://www.land.nrw/de/landesregierung/staatssekretaerinnen-und-staatssekretaere/ludwig-`

hecke\
\
But also found/received hashes differing from the supplied URL in the
beginning part, like the next 2 examples\

Code: 
:   `kSxEbrYaIN6S 5fARtrYaIN6S  http://permaculturenews.org/forums/index.php?threads/hello-from-northern-spain.15648/=`

\

Code:

\
\
So far the findings from the test session. With this it looks random and
spread over Numeros peers. Looking at the URLs I see recognize only all
have at least one = in search part (at least the 15 I checked\....)\
\
P.S. Some time ago I added already a check in \"URIMetadataNode(final
SolrDocument doc)\"\... looks like that didn\'t prevent this.
