English â€¢ Re: Minimum requirements for YaCy
===========================================

Date: 2014-01-22 17:32:06

YaCy version 1.67/9553\
Max 4 sites simultaneously + what sends other hosts (can\'t check as
status site not load).\
Index size: 2.2GB\
1GB Ram for YaCy\
\
Now values after restart YaCy (I have done this before I read your post,
so can\'t check before).\
0.5GB free memory during crawling\
Load average 0.5 for 1/5/15 minutes (very stable).\
\
I will supply more data on next crash, but\... I have to say, that it
looks like not all YaCy crash - just the web site. In system under top I
still seem java processes (only java processes on this system are
belongs to YaCy).
