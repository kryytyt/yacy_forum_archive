[If you have just a Windows box just for
yacy]{style="font-weight: bold"}, compress the hdd in advanced
properites.\
I did it to my disposable one and the gain on the YaCy home page
external load time was about 20% boost.\
\
Do a before and after test at <http://www.webpagetest.org/> make sure to
choose your location correctly. it will give some idea of how well your
system is performing.\
\
On My old P4 3 G as a Base Line for everyone to go by, no I am not going
to put yacy on old P2.\
I will say that on normal hdd space I had a load time of 8.1 seconds\
When using compression on hdd space it was approx 6.1 seconds.\
\
Will continue further testing with Java VM of 1200 mb.
