``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
added auto-refresh of user account data in case that the api/user.json
servlet is called. This was a complex task:
- added recognition of time stamps in dumps
- added check for freshness (refresh is currently done at most once per
day)
- fixed write-and-read operation in nosql data structure which was not
able to read most recently written records.
```
