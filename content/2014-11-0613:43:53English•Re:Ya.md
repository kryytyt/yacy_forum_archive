As promised, here is the relevant part of the email I had from Olimex (I
got it yesterday (5th November) in the morning):\

As I said before, I will not have much time to spend on this topic for a
few days at least, so for now I leave it the way it is. What I am
planning to do next:\
\* try to install the softwares from jessie repositories if possible: I
noticed that Yacy would not run on a fresh install of Debian Wheezy on
anthoer laptop, but would once getting upgrades from jessie repos. It
did not throw the same error, but make a try will not hurt.\
\* find or compile an Olinuxino image with armel instead of armhf.\
\
Once again, if I come to any relevant results, I shall let you know.
