Hi Fabrice, welcome and happy new year!\
\
Sorry for the late answer, but I confirm that as far as I know, starting
a crawl from a file with a list of entries is possible but currently
limited :\
- use the \"From File (enter a path within your local file system)\"
field in the advanced crawler (/CrawlStartExpert.html page)\
- file format : must be html or simple text (converting from a Excel
.xlsx file to .csv will work fine)\
- all entries listed in the file will share the same crawl
profile/parameters\
\
So if you have different crawl parameters for each of your crawl start
point, I would suggest you to write an external script (.sh, .bat or
whatever you prefer, depending on your OS) that will be responsible for
calling the /Crawler\_p.html
[API](http://www.yacy-websearch.net/wiki/index.php/Dev:APICrawler){.postlink}
with the appropriate parameters for each of your entry.\
To help you build the API URLs, you can go to the Process Scheduler page
(/Table\_API\_p.html) and pick up and adjust the URL of one of your
previously recorder crawl.\
\
Best regards
