Copy the Yacy directory and try this.\
Look at YaCy\\DATA\\LOG files and see if any Errors when starting.\
If so then please report at <http://mantis.tokeek.de/my_view_page.php>\
\
Delete yacy.conf in yacy\\data\\settings and try to start with
startYACY.bat in the copied directory.\
Try a reinstall of Yacy just a thought.\
\
Failing all that just get going again on different install dir.\
I have had to do it once or twice in the past 18 months.\
I now run a VPS server saves me on the power bill USD \$8.00/month.
