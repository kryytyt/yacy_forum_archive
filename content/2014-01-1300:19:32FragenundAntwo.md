\
Thats a good way to handle that.\

\
\"truly P2P\" is always a \'hack\' to tunnel \'somewhere\'. We have a
concept to use other YaCy peers as gateways for this (the Mentor and
Mentee concept) but there was no time yet to implement that. However,
this would also rely on \'true\' senior peers.\

I tried that for some time, but the main problem is here not stability
but the size of the VM image; I did not succeed in making images below
500MB. I know that this is not a big problem to download that, but it is
a big problem for me to upload this to a download location \...

\
Yes, it\'s a good concept.
