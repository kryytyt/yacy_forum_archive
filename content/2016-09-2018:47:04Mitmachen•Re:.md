Hello Bostan, I don\'t know if you found an answer to your question in
the meantime\...\
\
By the way, if you are still wondering, or for those interested, let\'s
try to clarify this : the error you get when you first enable HTTPS is
probably something like \"SEC\_ERROR\_UNKNOWN\_ISSUER\". This is because
YaCy provides a default certificate which is a
[self-signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate){.postlink}
one.\
This is not really a problem is you want to test HTTPS mode or only make
personnal use of your remote YaCy peer and need encryption but no host
identity certification.\
\
But it is a good idea to at least self-sign your own certificate, thus
not sharing the same private key as every YaCy peer who still use the
default one. It is even better to use a certificate signed by a
[Certificate
Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority){.postlink},
but it may be too expensive for you\... Alternatively you can try to get
a free and valid automatically signed certificate with a project such as
[Let\'s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/){.postlink}.\
\
For technical details of how to integrate your own certificate with
YaCy, you can read the yacy.init [related
section](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/Release_1.90/defaults/yacy.init#L31){.postlink}.\
\
I hope it was clear enough\...\
\
Best reagards,\
Luc
