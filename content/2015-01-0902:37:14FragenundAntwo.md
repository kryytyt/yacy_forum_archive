Fragen und Antworten â€¢ opensearch and \'\#\' in the URL
=======================================================

Date: 2015-01-09 02:37:14

Hi,\
\
opensearch for external search results seems to have trouble handling
\'\#\' character in the URL when configured under
\'ConfigHeuristics\_p.html\'\
Based on my experience the URL is cropped and everything located after
the \'\#\' is moved to the Comment field which should not be the desired
behaviour.\
\
Am I doing something wrong?\
\
Thanks,
