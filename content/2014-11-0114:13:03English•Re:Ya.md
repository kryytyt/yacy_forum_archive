English â€¢ Re: Yacy on an Olinuxino board

I was looking into getting one but I was reading the specs and they only
512 mb of RAM for \$85 board.\
If you have not made a system Swap file yet for it yet then I suggest
you find out how to.\
\
My first attempt on a 512 mb system kept crashing until I made a system
swap file, It crashed again not so often though, so I sprung the extra
\$2.00 /month for a 1 GB of ram its 27 days old now.
