> Over the past 2&frac12; months, Eric has generated 10.6 pounds of poop
> over 29 visits. \[\...\] To donate, Eric had to pass a 109-point
> clinical assessment. There is a laundry list of factors that would
> disqualify a donor: obesity, illicit drug use, antibiotic use, travel
> to regions with high risk of contracting diseases, even recent
> tattoos. His stools and blood also had to clear a battery of
> laboratory screenings to make sure he didn\'t have any infections.
>
> After all that screening, only 3% of prospective donors are healthy
> enough to give. \"I had no idea,\" he says about his poop. \"It turns
> out that it\'s fairly close to perfect.\"
>
> And that, unlike most people\'s poop, makes Eric\'s worth money.
> OpenBiome pays its 22 active donors \$40 per sample. They\'re
> encouraged to donate often, every day if they can. Eric has earned
> about \$1,000. \[\...\]
>
> The perfect poop is type three, which is \"like a sausage but with
> cracks on its surface;\" type four, which is \"like a sausage or
> snake, smooth and soft;\" or type five, \"soft blobs with clear-cut
> edges (passed easily).\" \[\...\]
>
> With a pipette, Kim transfers the watery remnants of Eric\'s poop into
> 250 ml plastic bottles. On average, one stool donation fills four, but
> today Eric\'s impressive half-pound sample fills seven. One bottle
> equals one treatment. \[\...\]
>
> Cool air blasts his face as Kim opens the freezer. His jaw drops at
> the sight of his icy brown bottles, which look like frozen chocolate
> milkshakes. The bacteria inside them is still alive, cryogenically
> preserved at -112Â°F.
