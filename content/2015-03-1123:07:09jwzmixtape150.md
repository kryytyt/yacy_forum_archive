Please enjoy [jwz mixtape
150](http://www.dnalounge.com/webcast/mixtapes/).

And today in \"Youtube sucks\" news \--

Remember a while ago I complained that Youtube seemed to have removed
the feature where you can set the start and end times of videos in a
playlist, thwarting my ability to make my playlists skip over end
credits and other noise? Well, the Shriekback fellows screwed up and
left 4 minutes of black at the end of their video \-- and I can\'t tell
the playlist to omit it. So, you know, hit \"Next\" when that happens.
Blah.

Thanks, Youtube, you just get better every day in every way.

The missing feature is [still
documented](https://www.youtube.com/yt/playbook/playlists.html) even
though the interface no longer exists, and by using [the
API](http://www.jwz.org/hacks/#youtube-api), I was able to set the end
time of that track to 04:11, but the player still ignores it.
