Hi lucipher, the internal Solr index upgrade from YaCy 1.92/9000 is
supposed to be automatic.\
\
But I would strongly recommend you to update to the latest GitHub
sources instead of 1.921/9236, as some Solr configuration issues related
to Solr 6.6 have been solved in the meantime (see commits
[4be4bfb](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commit/4be4bfbba61b02d60e0b7ac22663c5e7dacfb7a0){.postlink}
and
[f6e8d71](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commit/f6e8d7171865087d518f17278ad35a082b6cbfff){.postlink}).\
\
Hopefully this time it will work better. Don\'t hesitate to share your
feedback here.
