Not really sure what you mean but you can have your peer in an iframe on
a web site then have it crawled by other search engines by adding it to
there index to be crawled. I dont really know much about SEO.\
See [/ConfigPortal\_p.html]{style="font-weight: bold"} for some
examples. You need to setup some tags in the header and the file
robots.txt\
\
I have a program (somewhere) to generate hyper links on a web page from
just suppling URL\'s.
