Hilfe für Einsteiger und Anwender • Very High sudden CPU consumption
====================================================================

Date: 2014-10-31 14:28:21

Hi,\
\
Today, starting at around 10:00 AM, Yacy suddenly started to voratiously
eat CPU.\
\
Currently, I\'m at 100%, Load Average of around 3% (and my server only
has two cpu\'s)\
\
By looking at the logs, the only noticeable thing is that from 10:00 AM
onwards it only shows the following:\
\

Code: 
:   `W 2014/10/31 11:19:25 NormalizeDistributor adding of decoded rows to workers ended with timeout = 10000W 2014/10/31 11:19:25 NormalizeDistributor adding of decoded rows to workers ended with timeout = 10000W 2014/10/31 11:19:25 NormalizeDistributor adding of decoded rows to workers ended with timeout = 10000W 2014/10/31 11:24:48 NormalizeDistributor adding of decoded rows to workers ended with timeout = 10000W 2014/10/31 11:26:41 NormalizeDistributor adding of decoded rows to workers ended with timeout = 10000W 2014/10/31 11:26:41 NormalizeDistributor adding of decoded rows to workers ended with timeout = 10000W 2014/10/31 11:26:41 NormalizeDistributor adding of decoded rows to workers ended with timeout = 10000W 2014/10/31 11:26:42 NormalizeDistributor adding of decoded rows to workers ended with timeout = 10000W 2014/10/31 11:26:44 NormalizeDistributor adding of decoded rows to workers ended with timeout = 10000W 2014/10/31 11:28:21 NormalizeDistributor adding of decoded rows to workers ended with timeout = 10000`

I still didn\'t resarted Yacy, in case someone wants more up-to-date
data
