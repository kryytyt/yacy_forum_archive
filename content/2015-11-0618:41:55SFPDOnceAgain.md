> In what is becoming a tragic pattern, SFPD has once again blamed a
> cyclist for his own death. Simultaneously, the city has refused to
> release video that may shine light on the circumstances that resulted
> in the October 11th crash and death of 47-year-old Mark Heryer.
>
> Police have determined that Heryer was riding westbound on Market
> Street when, allegedly attempting to pass a bus, he lost control of
> his bicycle after his wheel got caught in a Muni track. Heryer then is
> said to have fallen under the passing 38-Geary bus to the right. He
> died at the scene.
>
> KQED News reports that police have now officially blamed Heryer for
> his own death, saying that vehicle code states he should have been
> riding in the bike lane. There\'s just one problem: That area of
> Market Street does not have bike lanes.
>
> Video from the Muni bus that ran over Heryer does exist, but the city
> will not release it \-- even to a lawyer representing Heryer\'s
> family.
