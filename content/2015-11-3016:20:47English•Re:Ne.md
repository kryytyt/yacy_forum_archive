Hi oyvinds, you are right, there is a lack of updates recently. I just
deployed the latest dev compile to the update directory.\

Oh, I actually did not know that latest.yacy.net points to kaskelix.org
which is the domain where this content should be. \"Kaskelix\" is the
name of the YaCy mascot. This domain hosts some slides about ideas for
future developments of YaCy into a larger infrastructure, also known as
\'YaCy2\'.
