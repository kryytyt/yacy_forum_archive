> The German American Bund was formed in 1936 to promote the causes of
> Nazi Germany in the United States. It was open to Americans of German
> descent, provided they could prove they had no black or Jewish
> ancestry. These guys were openly Nazis, like, not even the kind who
> think they can hide behind fake irony and shitty frog memes. Their
> flag was a swastika shooting out of an iron cross. So: fuck these guys
> entirely. \[\...\] They dissolved shortly after Pearl Harbor, when
> being openly a Nazi temporarily went out of style in the US, and
> everyone tried to pretend there hadn\'t been a 25,000 member
> organization of Americans dedicated to helping Hitler win.
>
> The German-American Bund had a lot of meetings in areas with high
> immigrant (read: Jewish) populations. One of those places was New York
> City. Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia affirmed that Nazis were allowed to
> meet, and were entitled to police protection, but he made sure the
> cops guarding their meetings were mostly black or Jewish. So that
> was\... passive aggressive. But then there was another local political
> figure: Judge Nathan D. Perlman.
>
> Judge Perlman, who was \-- no shit \-- Jewish, did not care for Nazis.
> This led him to reach out to one of the most powerful Jewish guys
> around: Meyer Lansky. Judge Perlman, as you might expect, hadn\'t done
> Meyer any favors in the past. He had for example helped to end
> Prohibition, the repeal of which, while generally extremely popular,
> wasn\'t great for the Meyer Lanskys of the world, who had been making
> bank off illegal booze. But when Perlman met with Meyer after the rise
> of the German American Bund, they ended up getting along pretty well.
> Perlman was like \"I want you to disrupt meetings of Nazis\" and Meyer
> was like \"excellent, on it,\" and Perlman was like \"hang on I\'m not
> finished\" and Meyer was like \"sorry\" and Perlman was like \"I will
> pay you and give you legal assistance, should anyone get arrested. The
> only condition is, don\'t kill anyone.\" With what I can only imagine
> to be the world\'s greatest eye roll, Meyer said \"Ugh fine, I won\'t
> kill anyone. Also, I don\'t want your money.\"
>
> And then he went to work. \[\...\]
>
> These attacks went on for over a year. Journalist Walter Winchell
> would praise the attacks from the air, and pass on information to
> Meyer about where and when the Nazis would be meeting. Life got pretty
> dangerous for Nazis in New York City.
>
> In the meantime, Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel also TRAINED other
> people to fight Nazis, which, come on, can you just imagine Meyer
> Lansky and Bugsy Siegel training young antifa in the early 30s? I love
> it. I\'m picturing a lot of newsboy caps and comments like \"no no not
> like that, my bubbe (ofblessedmemory) punches better than that, you
> grip the brass knuckles like this.\"
>
> This also seems like a good time to mention that Lucky Luciano,
> Meyer\'s
> definitely-not-boyfriend-I-don\'t-know-why-you-would-think-that,
> offered to send some of his guys to help with this, but Meyer told
> him, \"thanks, but no, this needs to be a Jewish fight.\"
