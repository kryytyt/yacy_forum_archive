> sometimes \-- crucially for this study \-- your latitude and longitude
> (lat/long).

> We identified the caucusing locations prior \[to\] the Iowa caucus and
> told our system to be on the lookout for devices that report a
> lat/long at those locations during the caucus. \[\...\]

> To build out that rich information set that you are referring to (we
> call them \'Crafted Audiences\'), we need to see a device several
> times across many different sites. We then use some pretty
> sophisticated machine learning techniques to extrapolate behaviors. We
> can only do this because we see such a broad view of digital behavior.
