English â€¢ Amount of RWIs no longer increasing
=============================================

Hi,\
\
I recently discovered that on my main peer \'endeavour\' the amount of
the RWIs is no longer increasing. Since sixcooler helped me with the
resouce observer (thank you very much) I\'m able to exclude this as an
issue (It\'s doing it\'s work very well now and honestly reports that
1,2 TB of space are available
![:-)](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")
). I\'m also doing excessive widespread webcrawls. What\'s the reason
that the amount of RWIs is no longer increasing at this peer?\

PS. I decided to start this thread in our english forum because I was
too lazy to write in my native language at this moment
