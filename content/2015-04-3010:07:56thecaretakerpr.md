``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
the caretaker process will now automatically re-load previously made
queries based on the expected query frequency of the latest retrievals.
To protect against very frequent topics, such topics get a retrieval
penalty if they appear with a period below 10 seconds.
To see the list of next-to-be-retrieved queries, see
http://localhost:9100/api/suggest.json?orderby=retrieval_next&order=asc
This function may be switched off in the future using a configuration
flag. If you like the function you must switch it then on again.
```
