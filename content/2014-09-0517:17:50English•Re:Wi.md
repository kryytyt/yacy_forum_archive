As far as I know, YaCy doesn\'t support wildcards yet. All the supported
search operators are listed on the advanced search page:
<http://localhost:8090/index.html?searchoptions=1>\

Sure! What search mode do you have currently selected on the basic
configuration page (<http://localhost:8090/ConfigBasic.html>)?\
\
Basically, all you have to do is to copy the code on the following page
of your search engine: <http://localhost:8090/ConfigSearchBox.html>, and
then within the \"customize\" settings of your tumblr, paste it in the
field \"Description\". The search box of your YaCy should now appear in
your tumblr sidebar. Of course you can paste the code somewhere else,
wherever you want the search box to appear.
