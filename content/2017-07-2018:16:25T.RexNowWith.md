I\'m sure you\'ve seen [the article](https://peerj.com/articles/3420/)
about how T. Rex probably couldn\'t run. Every video of the simulation
on Youtube has some talking head narrating the paper\'s outline at you,
along with 25 year old graphics from *Jurassic Park.* Who wants to see
that shit? So I did the only right thing: I looped the original video to
ten minutes and added Carl Stalling musical cues. You\'re welcome.

It\'s the little jazz hands that really sell it.

Also, if you were looking for a 3D model of this adorable little guy, I
think it\'s at [Animal Simulation
Laboratory](http://www.animalsimulation.org/).
