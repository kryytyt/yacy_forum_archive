Based on the above photo, obviously. I\'m hoping to 3D-print award
statues for the winners of the [DNA Lounge Cocktail Robotics Grand
Challenge](http://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2014/09-14.html) that will
resemble the flyer. Since anything worth doing is worth over-doing, I
geared it up so that turning the crank will move the feet! (Assuming I
got it right on the first try.) I don\'t think you can print springs,
though, so I didn\'t go that far.

Incidentally, Maya is a pain in the ass.
