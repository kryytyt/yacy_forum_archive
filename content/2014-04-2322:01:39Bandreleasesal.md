> Welcome to the most unnecessarily complicated netcat album release
> format yet.
>
> In this repository, you will be able to compile your own kernel
> module, create a `/dev/netcat` device and redirect its output into an
> audio player.
>
> This repository contains the album\'s track data in source files, that
> (for complexity\'s sake) came from .ogg files that were encoded from
> .wav files that were created from .mp3 files that were encoded from
> the mastered .wav files which were generated from ProTools final mix
> .wav files that were created from 24-track analog tape.
>
> Track information will show up in the output of dmesg.
