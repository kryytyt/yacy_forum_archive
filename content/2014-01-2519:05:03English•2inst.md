English â€¢ 2 instances of YaCy on the same host
==============================================

Date: 2014-01-25 19:05:03

I would like to install 2 instances of Yacy on the same server.\
\
The first running on 8090 port.\
The second on 8091.\
But if the first runs, the second is not reachable from outside.\
\
If the 2 instances are not and the same server, all works fine.\
\
I think that one service is listening on one port, but I do not know
which one.\
\
Which parameter must be changed for running correctily ?
