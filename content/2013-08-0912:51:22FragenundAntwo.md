To sixcooler!\
Thank you for the answer you forwarded to me concerning admittance to my
computer for other peers. i followed your advise. I have forwarded the
port 8090 in my router as you suggested. But never the less I do still
see the fatal message telling me that my computer is unattainable from
outside. - I have of course no problem with searching the internet
myself.\
Scanning the forum i can see that many others have the same problem as
me. So I appeal too to the technical staff in the YaCy-organisation.\
Sincerely, Ole Rohde
