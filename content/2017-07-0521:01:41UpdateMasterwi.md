You can view the correct path in the Dockerfile:
https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server/blob/7a1f0378dc40ec25eec6083e43558a62408d84e8/Dockerfile#L38
I checked in the container:
```
bash-4.3# ls /loklak_server/
bin              conf             gradlew          settings.gradle
build            data             html             src
build.gradle     gradle           installation     ssi
bash-4.3# ls /
bin            lib            proc           srv            var
dev            loklak_server  root           sys
etc            media          run            tmp
home           mnt            sbin           usr
```
the data directory exists and is filled within `/loklak_server`

Closes https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server/issues/1091

* disabling feature introduced with
27272eed7292db4ff9105d4ad65554be454c3445
for issue https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server/issues/919

The storage of the settings file caused that the settings file was
broken. It blew up to a huge file, like
$ ls -l customized_config.properties
-rw-r--r-- 1 loklak loklak 251650030 Apr 10 19:08
customized_config.properties

This is the main cause that loklak.org was down since this feature was
introduced.

* Use POST requests as fallback for GET requests - There are many cases (mostly https?://fb.me/*) when GET requests give status 400: Bad Request, while POST request works fine. The patch will allow to make an attemt for POST request for such cases and fetch the result.

Solves issue: https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server/issues/1172

Displays proper localhost url in which loklak_server is running after
the execution of bin/start.sh or bin/installation.sh with a "p" flag.

Earlier the localhost url only displayed port 9000 at the end in case of
bin/start.sh and concatenated the running port with 9000 in case of
bin/stop.sh.Ex:
http://localhost:9000 # bin/start.sh, actual port 8888
http://localhost:90008888 #bin/installation.sh, actual port 8888
