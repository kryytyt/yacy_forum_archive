The hexhash of a peer hash is an encoding of the 12 characters in
\[Dev:EnhancedBase64\|Enhanced-Base64 encoding\] from the 72-bit hash
into a representation using only hexadecimal values. The 12-charcter
hash is first decoded into a set of 9 8-bit bytes and then encoded to
hex. This results in 18 hex characters for an initial 12-character
base64 String.
