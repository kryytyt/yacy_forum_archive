I think what that actually says is, \"**\[MEMBER** **OF DEFUNCT

History.\"

I dunno, that all sounds fairly \"old man yells at cloud\" and that\'s a
lot of assertions without any support, let alone evidence. But maybe it
has \"truthiness\".

I am forever reminding people that [DNA
Lounge](https://www.dnalounge.com/)\'s competition is not the bar down
the street, it\'s Netflix.

Also, \"Nu Rave\"? Come on, that was never actually a thing, any more
than \"Seapunk\" was. They were punchlines in fashion magazines and
Tumblr posts, not subcultures.
