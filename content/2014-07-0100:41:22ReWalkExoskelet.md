> As a robotic exoskeleton that powers hip and knee motion, ReWalk
> enables patients with paraplegia due to spinal cord injuries at levels
> T7 (seventh thoracic vertebra) to L5 (fifth lumbar vertebra) to stand
> upright and walk. After multiple clinical studies, ReWalk is now the
> only exoskeleton in the United States with FDA clearance. The FDA had
> to review the ReWalk under its *de novo* classification process due to
> the novelty of the product as a first-of-its-kind medical device.
>
> ReWalk consists of a customized metal brace that supports the legs and
> part of the upper body, motors that supply movement at the hips,
> knees, and ankles, a tilt sensor, and a backpack that contains the
> computer and power supply. Crutches provide the user with additional
> stability when walking, standing, and rising up from a chair. Using a
> wireless remote control worn on the wrist, the user commands ReWalk to
> stand up, sit down or walk. All of these parts work together to
> replicate a natural gait experience.
