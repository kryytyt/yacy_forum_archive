Hi frderi2,\
authorization/authentication questions regarding smb and/or wiki servers
have been discussed many times in the past. The problem is, that any
information that YaCy would be able to crawl using an authentication
method would be leaked to users without that authentication, if they are
able to use YaCy to find at least the link to those resources. There
would be the need that YaCy provides the same authentication methods as
the resources which had been accessed by YaCy. Thats a problem and not
easy to solve.\
\
However, there are solutions which you can build around YaCy: i.e. you
can mount disk drives on the machine which is running YaCy you you can
then crawl the paths to these mounted drives using the file:// url.
Providing access to your server with YaCy on it would be equal to
granting access to the drives. That is something you can set up as an
administrator around YaCy. Users with the same disk drives mounted to
the same path would then be able to access the content which they find
in YaCy. That works also on windows (i.e. <file://z>:\\data..). In linux
the path starts with three \'/\', like file:///media/disk3
