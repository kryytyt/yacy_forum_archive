You might have to assume port 8443 or 443 and manually make a list,
which I could do for you.\

I think the certificate is self signed and that\'s why Firefox says its
untrusted. Do you know a free way to fix that?\
Chrome just gives me a sad face in a square box when I try to access
it.\
I will create create another certificate for my domain and see how that
goes.\
