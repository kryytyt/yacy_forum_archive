[\"Toilets are valuable precisely because they have no real relevance to
the game at hand,\" says Fullbright\'s Steve
Gaynor.](http://www.pcgamer.com/what-virtual-toilets-can-teach-us-about-the-art-of-game-design/)

> \"If there\'s a bathroom, there should be a toilet. And if there\'s a
> toilet, it should flush. It\'s these little pieces of seemingly
> pointless interactivity that maintain the illusion of being inside a
> functional other place, not just a place-shaped box.\" Toilets also
> reveal something about the people who build them. You can tell a lot
> about a developer\'s approach to world-building by the authenticity,
> and flushability, of its crappers. \[\...\]
>
> Developers are well aware of players\' fascination with toilets, and
> they\'re always leaving surprises there: whether it\'s loot, a hidden
> enemy, or in BioShock Infinite\'s case, a raw potato. \[\...\] But why
> a potato? Initially, Elliott is evasive. \"In an act of
> meta-commentary I placed a consumable potato in one of Columbia\'s
> toilets,\" he says. \"It was an interactive pay-off for inquisitive
> toilet inspectors, and also an acknowledgement of the absurdity of
> where items are found in our world. Pineapples in cash registers and
> so on.\" He adds: \"really, though, it just looked like a turd.\"
>
> I asked several developers what their favourite videogame toilet was,
> and the same game kept coming up: Frictional\'s psychological horror
> game Soma. \"There\'s an incredible toilet in the first few minutes,\"
> says Brendon Chung. \"You have fine analogue control over the toilet
> seat and flush handle. Flush it and you see the water swirling in the
> bowl. This is an absolutely luxurious amount of control reached by no
> other developer.\" \[\...\]
>
> As for the process of building a videogame toilet, it can be a
> surprisingly tricky task. I ask Frictional artist Aaron Clifford, who
> created Soma\'s peerless khazi, about the process. \"The toilet was in
> good shape, but I wasn\'t happy with the flush. It didn\'t do it
> justice. It was impossible to make a decent swirling effect using
> particle systems, so I used an animated water texture that moved along
> a strip of polygons. Then all I had to do was bend and twist the strip
> to have the water flow down the bowl.\"
