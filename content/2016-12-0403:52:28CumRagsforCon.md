> yet, does not have consciousness, and cannot exist without the mother

> human life, yet \"we do not mourn every ejaculation.\"

> When asked to elaborate on the symbolic significance of the action,
> Blackmore responds, \"It\'s crass, humiliating, disgusting, a waste of
> resources, and absurd, just like this regulation.\"
