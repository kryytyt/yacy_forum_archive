in time for Halloween, [Jack
Chick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Chick) has died, so it\'s a
great time to re-watch *The Light of the World,* his 2003 feature-length
love letter to Roman Catholics, Homosexuals, Dungeons & Dragons players,
Jews, Fornicators and Children of All Ages.

Unfortunately, the movie has been taken down from Youtube, but there is
[a working torrent of it
here](https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5873988/The_Light_Of_The_World_-_Jack_Chick_%28DivX%29).
It really is quite amazing. It is mostly a slow series of Ken
Burns-style pans across a large set of oil paintings, but those
paintings\... So much care! So much hate!

You really should play this in the background of every Halloween party
ever.

Tracts*](https://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=TO&Product_Code=OG-SITHRAKTRACTS&Category_Code=OG)?
They are glorious and informative and make excellent stocking stuffers.
