[Toller Bericht über \"Lawful Interception\" in den
Niederlanden](http://electrospaces.blogspot.de/2017/06/dutch-russian-cyber-crime-case-reveals.html).
Hier ist der geilste Teil:

> There was at least one security incident in Driebergen: De Volkskrant
> describes that during a meeting with FBI and FSB, a Russian official
> came to a member of the Dutch police team, pointed at someone from the
> FBI and said \"he is copying your data\". An investigator went looking
> and saw that indeed the American had a thumb drive in a police laptop
> and was copying Dutch information.

Wait, what?!
