Nice things could be a more intensive cleanup like I have always
proposed:\
- Use interface as type-hint wherever possible\
- Rewrite the bootup/shutdown process to visitor-based approach\
- Get rid of more old code and replace it with encapsulated (new) code\
\
I was asked by Orbiter by through email if I\'m still involved in YaCy,
so here is the answer: Only running an out-dated node as my changes has
not been fully merged. In development I have currently retired from it
as my patches are declared as \"change all and everything\".
