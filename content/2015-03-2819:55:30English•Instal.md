Hello\
First i want to congratulate your team for your beautiful script and the
excellent idea for peer to peer function.\
I want to use this search engine for my own portal and i would like to
ask:\
How can i install it in 4-5 different servers so to make different
crowling at the same time and to \"connect\" all the results from all
servers to one and only server with one domain?\
Thank you very much
