English â€¢ Re: P2P mode, dht exchange
====================================

We need to build a network of private peers, too.\
How do we do this?\
All the references I can find are many years old.\
Since the basic internal structure of YaCy has changed considerably in
recent years, and now uses Solr, using those old instructions can be
fatal.\
We currently have 3 Robinson servers that only read each other.\
We want to convert then and add more minimum 2+ more servers to make a
private, secure, P2P + DHT environment.\
Where are instructions to do this, please?\
We must not lose the considerable amount of data we have already
harvested.\
\
Who knows how to do this, please?\
Many thanks
