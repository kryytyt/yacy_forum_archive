> The 20,000 litre-batch of maple syrup was supposed to be shipped to
> Japan last Thursday, but Mexuscan Transport had been forced to store
> the shipment at the holding facility due to a delay.
>
> Police recovered the trailer in the west Montreal borough of Saint
> Laurent, but the maple syrup was gone.
>
> Although the theft could prove costly for Mexuscan, it\'s not the
> sweetest heist ever pulled off in Quebec. That distinction belongs to
> the massive maple syrup heist of 2011-2012, in which 2.7 million
> litres of the stuff were stolen from a warehouse in Quebec. The syrup
> was estimated to be worth \$18 million. More than a dozen individuals
> were later arrested in the case.
