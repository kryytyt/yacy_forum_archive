> The earliest ever \"skull cult\" has been discovered in Turkey, with
> evidence indicating people living there 11,000 years ago would deflesh
> and carve up human skulls shortly after death for ritual purposes. At
> present, these fragments represent the oldest ever evidence of a skull
> cult. \[\...\]
>
> Analysis shows the flesh was removed from the skull and that the
> carvings were made just after death \-- the cuts were made when the
> bone was still elastic, but there was no sign of healing. \[\...\]
>
> At first the team thought they could be looking at the first attempts
> at skull carving, but as all the incisions were the same, they believe
> this cannot be the case. \"Maybe it was not to show the carvings to
> other people,\" Gresky says. \"Another interpretation is that these
> carvings were meant as a track for a cord, or to fix some decoration
> to it. The skull is round so if you placed a cord on it, it would slip
> to one side, so the carving could be to fix something in place.\"

> The scientists now hope to find more skulls.
