[The San Francisco skyline has been forever changed by the large erect
Salesforce tower thrusting up into the
heavens.](https://www.change.org/p/www-monarchsf-com-install-a-majestic-artistic-fountain-on-top-of-the-salesforce-tower)

> While it is a glorious sight to behold, I think we can make it
> better!! I propose to install an artistic fountain at the tip of the
> tower (above the shaft). To conserve water we will build 2 large
> spherical water tanks at the base of the tower that will collect and
> recycle the water as it flows down the shaft of the building.
