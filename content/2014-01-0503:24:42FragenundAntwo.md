Assuming you are on Windows.\
You may find your router here
<http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/>\
Choose your brand then close the advert.\
\
You then see a list of models to click on, if yours is not listed then
have a look at a few examples to see what to do.\
\
When you click on a model it gives a list of games choose Age of Empires
but change port numbers to 8090 on just one entry, you may have to know
the IP of your PC so use the run command and type in CMD then in the
window type IPCONFIG then look at the IP of Ethernet adapter Local Area
Connection or the Ethernet adapter Wireless Network Connection, note
down the numbers after IP Address to use in the router virtual server
config.\
Hope you can follow this.
