Automator
=========

Dear Lazyweb, how do I turn off automator sandboxing?

For months now I\'ve had an Automator action that was working fine: it
does some stuff, then at the end does
`"run script XYZ with parameters ARGS"`. And now, magically, today, that
last part has stopped working, even after I rebooted. I have no idea
what changed. System log:

> `iTunes[269]: AppleEvents/sandbox: Returning errAEPrivilegeError/-10004 and denying dispatch of event syso/exec from process 'Automator Runner'/0x0-0x51051, pid=608, because it is not entitled to send an AppleEvent to this process. com.apple.automator.xpc.workflowServiceRunner[554]: WorkflowServiceRunner received error running Workflow Service at /Users/jwz/Library/Services/Add to iTunes.workflow: The action "Run AppleScript" encountered an error. `{style="font-size:smaller"}

I already have Automator, Automator Runner and AppleScript Editor
enabled in System Preferences / Security and Privacy / Privacy /
Accessibility.

I swear, the logo for Automator should be a little hammer hitting you in
the face.
