are looking at an administration that is very clearly being operated on
behalf of carbon extraction

> There is a huge asset bubble tied up in uncombustable fossil fuels \--
> the carbon bubble. In addition, there is a base of approximately
> \$70Tn (\$70,000 billion\--let that sink in for a moment) of installed
> infrastructure for processing fossil fuels and petrochemicals \[\...\]
> It follows logically that if you have heavily invested in fossil
> fuels, time is running out to realize a return on your investment.
> Buying a US administration tailored to maximize ROI while fighting a
> rear-guard action against action on climate change and roll-out of a
> new, rival energy infrastructure is therefore rational (in business
> terms). Russia and the Putin angle is best understood as part of this.

> Note that climate change denialism is a flag of convenience for the
> folks at the top. It\'s a loyalty oath and a touchstone: they don\'t
> necessarily believe it, but it\'s very convenient to fervently preach
> it in public if you want to continue to turn a profit.
>
> If you believe in anthropogenic climate change but dare not admit it,
> you cannot be seen to do anything obvious to remediate it. But there
> is one remediation tactic you can deploy deniably: genocide.
>
> We are on course to hit 10 billion people by the end of the 21st
> century, and although the second derivative of the curve of population
> increase is flat, our peak population won\'t begin to decline at this
> rate until well into the 22nd century. \[\...\]
>
> While the gas chambers and extermination camps of the Final Solution
> get the most attention, people tend to forget that a large chunk of
> Hitler\'s plan for conquest, Generalplan Ost, relied in the short term
> on the Hunger Plan \-- to kill 20-30 million people in Eastern Europe
> and Russia by systematically stealing their food. \[\...\]
>
> But the Neo-Nazi International won\'t need death camps in the 2020s to
> 2030s if their goal is to cut the world population by, say, 50%.
> Climate change and a clampdown on international travel will do the job
> for them. \[\...\]
>
> Never say Nazis don\'t learn the lessons of history. This time round,
> the Final Solution to Anthropogenic Climate change will be entirely
> deniable! There are no gas chambers or Einsatzgruppen involved: any
> bullets will be fired by autonomous robots, without a human finger on
> the trigger, and will be an automatic reaction to an attempted border
> crossing, so not the fault of the perpetrators. The victims will have
> only themselves to blame, for being born in the wrong place, in the
> wrong century, and for failing to adapt, and for starving themselves,
> and for inviting the attention of the border patrol drones. It will be
> a slow-motion atrocity on a scale that dwarfs the Holocaust. And it is
> the logical conclusion of the policies our new fascist international
> overlords appear to be working towards implementing.
