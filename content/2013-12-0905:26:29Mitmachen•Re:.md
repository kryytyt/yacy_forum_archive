Hmm, so here\'s a similar idea. Let\'s say I run a YaCy node locally to
perform searches. How about if my node keeps track of the other nodes
which served good results to me (this could be based on results which I
clicked, or via some other metrics), and periodically I can click a link
in my YaCy node which generates a Bitcoin URL which will donate a
certain amount of money (which I specify) to those nodes, split
proportionally to how many good results were served to me by each node.
This incentivises nodes to crawl/index large numbers of sites. Would
something like this be workable?
