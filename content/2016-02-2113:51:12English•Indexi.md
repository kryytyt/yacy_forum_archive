English â€¢ Indexing local file:/// without going upwards
=======================================================

Date: 2016-02-21 13:51:12

Hi,\
\
how can I prevent a crawl from going upwards in the file hierachy given
a path to start with via file:///home/user/data?\
The thing that seems happening is that (maybe due to symlinks?) the
crawler at some point starts index even root-folders of a linux system ,
so it clearly goes upwards and crawls folders like \"/var /usr /boot\",
etc.\
\
Crawler filter was already set to \"Restrict to subpaths\", any idea how
to make sure Yacy only goes downwards, but never upwards in
filehierachy?
