Then do it!\
Showing a random selected YaCy-Peer is a powerful demonstration of the
concept [distributed]{style="font-style: italic"}.\
After heavily testing <http://130.255.73.69:5353/forward?random> i can
say there are no problems, except a few 403-Errors from some YaCy-Peers
but liable for this are the YaCy-Developers.\
Okay, some of the Peers are slow but if this is really a problem i can
add a test for the response-time and accept only fast peers for the
internal Random-List.\
And my Random-List is very up to date, all IP-Addresses are positive
tested within the last 30 seconds.\

One of the positive effects of a load-balancer is too avoid
overstressing a single machine.\
