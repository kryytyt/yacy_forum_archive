[Uber whines about insurance rules that would level the playing
field](http://48hillsonline.org/2014/08/12/uber-whines-insurance-rules-level-playing-field/)

[Lyft: \"Uber scheduled, canceled 5,000 rides to hassle
us\"](http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/08/lyft-uber-scheduled-canceled-5000-rides-to-hassle-us/)

> CNN reports that people associated with car-on-demand service Uber
> have been attempting to sabotage an Uber competitor, Lyft, by ordering
> and canceling as many as 5,000 rides since October 2013. Lyft drivers
> have also complained that Uber employees will call them to take
> \"short, low-profit rides largely devoted to luring them to work for
> Uber.\"
>
> Lyft claims to have sussed out the fake requests using phone numbers
> used by \"known Uber recruiters.\" Lyft claims that one Uber recruiter
> requested and canceled 300 rides from May 26 to June 10, and it said
> that recruiter\'s phone number was associated with 21 more accounts
> with 1,524 canceled rides between them.

*(My understanding is that this is exactly in keeping with the
Libertarian Dream, so everything\'s fine. The market works!)*
