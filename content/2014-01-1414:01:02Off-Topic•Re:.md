Maybe you misinterpreted me.\
And maybe it\'s my fault, I didn\'t think that creating a new topic on a
related subject was worth so I just replied here.
![:?](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif "Confused")\
I didn\'t say \'Create a spanish section\' (although I am not against
it) what I did say was \'Create an international section\'.\
And what you said about the need to have someone that can understand
what is being said is absotutely correct!\
\
When I say international, I mean english-based section.\
I don\'t think that we have people enough to a spanish section.\
But an english section seems to be missing (see
