Patent 20140066698: Squirt
Watch:](https://www.google.com/patents/US20140066698)

> 1\. A Squirt Watch comprising of a housing wrist band, lens, push button,
> microcontroller, accelerometer, red, yellow, and green light emitting
> diodes (LED), resistors, capacitors and battery create a watch like
> device that assists a women\'s partner in giving said women a squirting
> orgasm by giving feedback to the person wearing the watch for proper
> force and speed of the said wearers wrist/hand/finger motion on the said
> subjects G spot. The housing protects the electronics from getting wet
> or damage and is securely held to the said wearer\'s wrist by a
> wristband. The microcontroller is activated when the said wearer pushes
> the on/off button at which time the microcontroller turns on the
> accelerometer and accumulates raw data from the accelerometer in real
> time. See FIG. 1 for hardware block diagram. The microprocessor takes
> the data and compares it to a set of known data to see if the said
> wearer is matching the correct speed and G-force to give a woman a
> squirting orgasm. See FIG. 3 for the software block diagram. When enough
> force of the said wearer of the squirt watch is achieved a green LED
> with light. When enough speed or frequency is reached a green LED will
> light on the speed indicator giving the said wearer of the squirt watch
> that they do not need to go any faster.
>
> 2\. The Squirt Watch of claim 1 further comprises a waterproof sealing
> system to at least 5 meters.
>
> 3\. The Squirt Watch of claim 1 may use a single LED for all three colors
> red, yellow and green.
>
> 4\. The Squirt Watch of claim 1 may further be disguised as a working
> watch with secret mode that activates the LED measuring system.
>
> 5\. The Squirt Watch may use two batteries one for the normal watch
> functionality and one for the speed and force measurement system of
> LED\'s.
>
> 6\. The Squirt Watch of claim 1 further comprises an audible feedback
> system when correct force and or frequency is achieved.
>
> 7\. The Squirt Watch of claim 1 further comprises a blue tooth feedback
> system when the correct force and or frequency is achieved.
>
> 8\. The Squirt Watch of claim 1 will put itself to sleep after a
> reasonable amount of time if there is not enough speed or force to
> activate the LED\'s thus saving battery power.
>
> 9\. The Squirt Watch of claim 1 may have more than 3 indicators showing
> progress toward the correct frequency and force.
>
> 10\. The Squirt Watch of claim 4 may use the two sets of G-force and
> Speed LED\'s to represent the markings for 2, 4, 6,8,10 and 12 o\'clock.
> Or for the 1,3,5,7,9, and 11 o\'clock.
