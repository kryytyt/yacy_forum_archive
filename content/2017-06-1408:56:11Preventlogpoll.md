Prevent log pollution from unwanted Solr warnings.

Many non-blocking "java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException" traces with
warning log level can be logged by Solr, especially when heavily
crawling. This is issue is known from Solr 5.x but still unresolved with
Solr 6.x ( https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-9120 )

Consequently upgraded to "SEVERE" the default log level of the related
internal Solr class.
