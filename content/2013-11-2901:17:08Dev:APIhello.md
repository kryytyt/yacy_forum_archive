When a peer is pinged by calling the hello.html servlet the ping\'ed
peer tries to ping the ping-ing peer back by calling the ping-ing peers
\[\[Dev:APIquery\|/yacy/query.html\]\] servlet. If the ping\'ed peer
gets a respond from the ping-ing peer, it assigns the ping-ing peer the
\[\[Dev:PeerType\#senior\|senior\]\] status, otherwise the status is
\[\[Dev:PeerType\#junior\|junior\]\]. After the ping-ing peer gets a
result, it assigns itself the status as reported by the ping process. If
the peer gets no answer at all (i.e. a timeout happens), the peer
assigns itself the \[\[Dev:PeerType\#virgin\|virgin\]\] status.
