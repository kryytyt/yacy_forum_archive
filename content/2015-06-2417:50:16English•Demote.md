English â€¢ Demote CMS template images
====================================

Date: 2015-06-24 17:50:16

Performing image searches, most of the returned results are images part
of the website standard CMS template, such as company logo, navigation
icons and banners.\
These have no relation at all with the query, but they appear in every
page of the entire website and thus are always picked up by YaCy and
thrown into the search results.\
\
I\'d like of this thread could be the incipit to start some thinkering
on how to demote these images.
