Hi,\
\
if you want to limit the System-usage of YaCy on a Linux-System you can
use a build-in feature to set the max systemload at Performance Settings
of Queues and Processes (/PerformanceQueues\_p.html) on the right
column:\
There you can set for each task of YaCy a maximum Systemload - of the
system has an higher load this task stops untill the load is lower than
the value.\
\
For eg. I use a Max Systemload of 1.0 for Local crawl - whenever there
is load from other processes, or tasks of yacy this stops and the System
has recources left for other things.\
The Systemload is much more precise than the cpu-usage for tuning in
order to have an always usable system. On the other hand this is not
available for Windows-Systems.\
