=======================================================

Thanks to sixcooler!\
I appreciate your advises; have tried all of them and happily been told,
that I now was a senior member of the net. But just for the actual
session!\
Next time I was on it did not work. I have forwarded port 8090 in booth
TCP and UDP mode; in the Linux firewall as well as in the router.\
So what now? I sadly conclude until further that my system (openSUSE
12.3 and Firefox) and YaCy are not fully compatible.\
My hope is, that openSUSE in near future include YaCy as default
package, ready to be installed and running.\
Yours sincerely, Ole Rohde
