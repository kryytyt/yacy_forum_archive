This is very bad.\
I have posted a bug report at <http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=492>\

Who knows how to do this, please? This is critical failure, & it is not
a hobby project.\

Yes, it works, but there are 700+ entries on one server alone.\
What we need is to recover an instruction set, not oceans of lines to
copy & paste.\
There are weeks of continuous crawls, 24/7 on each server.\
How to do this, please?\
Many thanks
