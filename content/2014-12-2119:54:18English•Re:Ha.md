The Link with an IP-Address has this form: \"1.2.3.4:8090/\" (the
IP-Address must be your public/external IP-Address)\

This is correct. It seems you use a NAT-Router, please see to
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network\_ad \...
ranslation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation){.postlink}
for more details.\
An internal IP-Address is only valid/usable inside your local Network,
and in a local Network are typical only private/internal IP-Addresses
usable/available.\

The problem may be the Configuration of your Router, please look into
the manual of your Router for correct configuration of a
Port-Forwarding. An alternative can be UPnP, if your Router does support
it, your YaCy-Peer may be able to use this protocol for opening the
Port-Forwarding automatically if enabled. An other possible reason can
be a port-blocking by your ISP.\

This is also correct, private/internal IP-Addresses are not usable on
the global/public Internet.\

The short time is the timeout for creating a TCP-Connection from my
Server to your Computer and it seems that your Router or your Computer
does not responds to my Server. Probably is the Port-Forwarding in your
Router not working correctly or the Connection is blocked by an other
reason.\
\
What do your router think about your
[public]{style="text-decoration: underline"} IP-Address? Is it the same
as reported by canyouseeme.org or yacy.info?\
