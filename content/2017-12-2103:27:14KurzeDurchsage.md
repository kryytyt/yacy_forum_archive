[Kurze Durchsage von James \"Spontaner Spot-Alzheimer\"
Clapper](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/19/politics/trump-putin-relationship/index.html):

> Clapper made clear he was only speaking figuratively when referring to
> Trump as a Russian asset.

Ã–h... wie meinen? Da wollen wir doch alle sehen, was er da
\"figuratively\" gesagt hat, oder? Hier ist es:

> \"I think this past weekend is illustrative of what a great case
> officer Vladimir Putin is. He knows how to handle an asset, and
> that\'s what he\'s doing with the President,\" said James Clapper
> \[...\]
>
> \"You have to remember Putin\'s background. He\'s a KGB officer.
> That\'s what they do. They recruit assets,\" Clapper added. \"And I
> think some of that experience and instincts of Putin has come into
> play here in his managing of a pretty important account for him.\"
