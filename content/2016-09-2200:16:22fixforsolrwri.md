fix for solr write.lock after mode change http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=686
The embedded core holds a lock on the index and must be closed. Earlier commit
comment states that core should be closed with solr instance instead on close 
of connector.
Adjusted the InstanceMirror.close() to take care of closing the embedded 
instance to release the lock.
In 2 routines of fulltext this was already explicite implemented (disconnectLocalSolr).
Now this disconnect is part of the InstanceMirror.close().
```
