~~A proxy is a program, which redirect internet-traffic from i.e. a
local network of computers to the internet and back. Sometimes the Host
where the proxy software is installed has no other function and is
called proxy itself. A caching proxy saves the websites and pictures on
it etc. locally to save bandwidth when a computer \"behind the proxy\"
requests already loaded content.~~
