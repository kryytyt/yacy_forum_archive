=================

![](http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/screenshots/tessellimage.jpg)[XScreenSaver
5.27 out now](http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/). A couple new hacks this
time, and a bunch of performance improvements and bug fixes, plus
support for multithreading. Currently only the analogtv hacks and
interference are taking advantage of that, but it helps!

I\'m moderately pleased with how tessellimage (pictured to the right)
looks, but it\'s really slow until it builds its cache.
