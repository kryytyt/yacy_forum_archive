``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
quick fix: go back to display search results favicon via  tag and ViewImage,
! until better solution is found !.

Reason: in IE-Browser no individual favicon is displayed with  tag 
(always the default) and only few individual fav's with Firefox (randomly)

hint: to be able to use  return of default icon was
added back to it.
