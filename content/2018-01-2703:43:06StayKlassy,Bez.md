> The report revealed that Amazon warehouses also receive significant
> state and local subsidies.

> the tens of thousands of dollars its Ohio workers need each month in
> food benefits,\" Zach Schiller, a research director at Policy Matters
> Ohio, said in a release on January 5. \"When you consider that, the
> subsidies are even larger,\" Schiller said.
