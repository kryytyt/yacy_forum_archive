> Million Fishes Art Collective sat at the corner of 23rd and Bryant for
> nearly a decade, reportedly paying over \$5,000 a month in rent for a
> space deep within gang territory. The 10,000 square foot collective
> housed dozens of artists and was routinely open to the public for
> shows.
>
> But soon the neighborhood became trendy among techies and the gang
> violence subsided. And in the fall of 2012, Million Fishes\' landlord
> booted them from the space with the hopes of attracting a monied
> startup to the space. \[\...\]
>
> Squandering nearly \$400,000 a year in venture capital just to be in a
> hip neighborhood proved to be a terrible investment for Bloodhound.
> Despite TechCrunch\'s glowing coverage and claims that their growth
> strategy was \"working like a charm,\" the app didn\'t pan out. In a
> blog post authored on Valentine\'s Day this year, the company
> announced it was killing off conference app and \'pivoting\' to a
> business card-scanning program.
>
> Now it seems the startup has burned through its cash. According to a
> lawsuit filed in the San Francisco Superior Court last month,
> Bloodhound has become a deadbeat \-- not paying their hefty rent since
> May.
>
> When emailed for comment, Bloodhound co-founder Anthony Krumeich
> simply stated \"We moved out of the office. No longer fit our needs.\"
> However court documents indicate Bloodhound has gone AWOL and
> abandoned their office. The landlord\'s attorney has not been able to
> issue the company or its founders a summons. Now court documents are
> prominently taped to Bloodhound\'s former front door. \[\...\]

> It\'s rarely a case of flailing businesses finally succumbing to their
> inevitable death \-- it\'s often a story of sustainable small
> businesses being axed in favor of startups with speculative wealth.
> But the consequence of startups pushing up rents to unsustainable
> levels is that it ends up gutting the very culture that made these
> \"hip\" communities interesting in the first place.
