Is there still no way to give an employee the ability to post to Twitter
from their phone without sharing the password with them?

If you use TweetDeck on a desktop, you can set up a
[\"Team\"](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20171753) where an
employee has their own password, and has the ability to post to the
business account, but does *not* have access to the password that can
lock everyone else out.

But as far as I can tell, there\'s no way to do this on mobile. As they
rolled out \"teams\" over two years ago, I assume they have no plans to
fix this oversight.

I guess I could host my own access-controlled web page that allowed my
employees to post text and images to a form, and then have it twit on
the back end\... but that would totally not work at all for video. (All
of the social media apps resize the video locally first and then upload
it in resumable chunks, and with good reason. You can\'t accomplish this
sort of thing without a native app.)
