Hello ds810, apparently you didn\'t apply the fix correctly : you must
use (.\*/\|) and not (.\*/)\* .It is important to remove the \* after
the capturing group, because this is what makes the performance issue
with URLs having many path segments ( by segment I mean each /nnn/
part).\
You can check yourself how (.\*/\|) is sufficient. You do not need to
add the \* after the parenthesis. Detailed explanation of the new
capturing group (.\*/\|) :\
- .\* : captures any characters including /\
- / : ensures the capturing group effectively ends with a / character\
- \| : ensures this capturing group can be empty : we either have .\*/
or nothing in the group\
\
So this new capturing group effectively captures the same things that
(.\*/)\* but in a more efficient manner with current JDK Pattern
implementations.\

Best regards
