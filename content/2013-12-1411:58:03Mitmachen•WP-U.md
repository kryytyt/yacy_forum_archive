Mitmachen • WP-UserOnline with YaCy
===================================

Date: 2013-12-14 11:58:03

I run a WordPress Blog and the WordPress-Plugin WP-UserOnline from
<http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-useronline/> but every time when my
YaCy-Peer or another YaCy-Peer visited my blog the peer was displayed as
an user and not as a search engine. So I quickly changed the plugin
WP-UserOnline a little bit and now it is displayed correct.\
\
How to:\
Open core.php of the WordPress-Plugin WP-UserOnline and look for\

Code: 
:   `         'Yandex' => 'yandex',`

\
change this to\

Code: 
:   `         'Yandex' => 'yandex',         'YaCy' => 'yacy',`

\
and thats it.\
\
You also can download it here:\

As long as this is a very minor change I asked the developers of the
original plugin to add yacy to their list of search engines and to not
publish a new plugin on wordpress by myself.
