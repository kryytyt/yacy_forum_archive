> My aim in designing the first Tiny Lisp Computer was to create the
> smallest practical self-contained computer, with its own display and
> keyboard, that you could use to program in Lisp.
>
> This second version extends the original Tiny Lisp Computer with four
> improvements: it uses the ATmega1284 to give it more program space; it
> includes parenthesis matching to make it easier to enter programs; it
> allows you to connect it to a computer via the USB port, to enter
> programs from the Arduino IDE\'s serial monitor; and it includes a
> built-in program editor, to allow you to make changes to programs
> without having to enter them again. \[\...\]
>
> As an example of using the program editor, enter the following
> function b that blinks the LED on pin 13 once a second:
>
> ::: {style="margin-left: 2em"}
> `(defun b (x) (pinmode 13 t) (digitalwrite 13 x) (delay 500) (b (not x)))`
> :::
>
> Suppose we now want to change the delay parameter to 250 to make it
> blink twice as quickly. First give the command:
>
> ::: {style="margin-left: 2em"}
> `(edit 'b)`
> :::
>
> The editor prints the current context:
>
> ::: {style="margin-left: 2em"}
> `(lambda (x) (pinmode 13 t) (digitalwrite 13 x) (delay 500) (b (not x)))`
> :::
>
> where lambda is the internal representation for a function. Get to the
> delay command by typing:
>
> ::: {style="margin-left: 2em"}
> `dddd`
> :::
>
> The editor prints:
>
> ::: {style="margin-left: 2em"}
> `((delay 500) (b (not x)))`
> :::
>
> Now get to the 500 by typing:

> ::: {style="margin-left: 2em"}

>
> The editor responds:

Code-data equivalence FTW! I am also pleased to note the tail-call
elimination.

For the next version, and before [mounting it on a Power
Glove](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbhJLpuobc8), I\'d like to
suggest adding support for the [Atari 2600 Keyboard
Controllers](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2002/12/l33t-h4x0r/). Oh look,
someone wrote a recent-ish review!

[A constructive look at the Atari 2600 BASIC
cartridge:](http://boston.conman.org/2015/06/16.1)

> Honestly, I don\'t think the Atari 2600 BASIC has ever had a fair

> fast the program will run (1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30 and 60 are the speed
> values and they reflect how often the interpreter is run \-- once a
> second, twice a second, on up to 60 times a second). The \"PROGRAM\"
> window obviously contains the program (all nine lines if you have that
