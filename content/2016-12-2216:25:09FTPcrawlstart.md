FTP crawl start URLs : applied crawl profile depth control

Applied rules :
- when the FTP URL denotes a file resource, stack it as any start URL :
eventually embedded links can be followed applying the usual depth rules
- when the FTP URL denotes a directory, list files under this directory
and stack them for crawl, and repeat the process on sub folders until
crawl depth is reached
```
