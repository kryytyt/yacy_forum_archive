English â€¢ Re: Minimum requirements for YaCy
===========================================

I recently added resource observer actions which starts to delete index
elements if the space on disk is low (\< 1GB). I will continue to use
the system monitoring to adopt the behaviour of YaCy, so one answer to
the \'minimum requirements\' is: there is no, the architecture will
contain elements for auto-scaling. But however, I cannot ensure that
this works already.
