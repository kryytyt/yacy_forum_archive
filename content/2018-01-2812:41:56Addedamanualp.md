Added a manual performance test for the HostBalancer.

Consequently to the report in mantis 776
(http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=776).

Running the perfs test with different control parameters seems to reveal
that the YaCy's RowHandleMap used in the balancer depthCache is finally
more efficient than for example the ConcurrentHashMap from JDK 8.
