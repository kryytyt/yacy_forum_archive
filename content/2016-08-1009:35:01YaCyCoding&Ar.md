I thinks this depends on your crawler and performance settings. I am not
aware of /CrawlStartSite.html or /CrawlStartExpert.html setting time
restrictions to submit new crawls.\
So if you submit many new crawls in a short time, I guess you would
eventually end up with your crawl queue being full because reaching
memory limits. The best is even to test this.
