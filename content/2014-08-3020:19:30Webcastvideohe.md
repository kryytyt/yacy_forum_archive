I need:

1: A replacement for Justin.tv that isn\'t Streamup.com.

2: A cheap SDI Frame Synchronizer.
:::

Can you help?

Details:

1.  Since [Justin.tv shut
    down](http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2014/08/05.html),
    Streamup is the only replacement site that I\'ve found for our
    [webcast video](http://www.dnalounge.com/webcast/) that meets the
    following specifications:

    1.  Accepts RTMP video streams 24/7;
    2.  Has a web-page-embeddable player;
    3.  Does not spam my viewers with ads;
    4.  Is free to both me and my viewers.

    However, they fail to meet the implicit specification, \"actually
    works.\"

    Their embedded Flash player sometimes makes *all three* browsers
    just go catatonic-hypnowheel for minutes at a time; on one of my
    machines it will just never load at all, but on another it will, in
    the same browser; and since they made some \"improvements\"
    recently, [FMLECmd won\'t
    connect](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/08/fmle-app-works-but-fmlecmd-does-not/)
    to their server at all if the input source is digital instead of
    analog. Though the FMLE GUI *will* connect. Which is a whole lot of
    WTF.

    I\'ve tried to contact them via their support email and Twitter and
    a couple of times with no response. After my [last blog
    post](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/08/streamup-less-than-ideal/), I
    got a glad-handing response from a marketing guy, but after I
    replied with, \"Yes, here are my very specific technical
    problems\"\... crickets.

    So, FMLECmd is junk, but it used to work with Justin, and it worked
    with Streamup as of just-before-their-upgrade. Presumably there\'s a
    way to do RTMP streaming on MacOS with ffmpeg, but [I don\'t know
    it](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/08/fmle-app-works-but-fmlecmd-does-not/#comment-156835).

2.  A Frame Synchronizer takes an SDI HD stream that has inconsistent,
    variable sync and outputs a single, stable SDI or HDMI stream. I
    would like to spend closer to a *hundred* bucks on this than two
    grand, which seems to be what these things retail for. We found a
    cheap Hotronic AY86 on eBay which sounded like it would do the
    trick, but it arrived DOA. Any suggestions?

    We need this because our new SDI video cameras are not genlocked, so
    when our SDI matrix switcher changes inputs, the sync changes. This
    causes downstream HDMI devices, like the TVs in the restaurant, to
    go blank for 8-10 seconds and renegotiate, like they do when you
    un-plug the cable, every time the switcher switches. Because HDMI is
    awesome.
