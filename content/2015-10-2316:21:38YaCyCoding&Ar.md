YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: Extend Image preview formats support
=====================================================================

Date: 2015-10-23 16:21:38

Hello, I fixed full size preview of TIFF images, and some other little
issues : <https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/pull/21>.\
Notes :\
- Konqueror web browser has built-in support for Tiff images\
- Tiff rendering based on twelve monkeys library works well but doesn\'t
support some Tiff features like CCITT T.4 compression or exotic pixels
bits depths : you can easily check it with new ViewImageTest class and
for example test suite from libtiff
(<http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/images.html>\
\
Next week planned works :\
- rendering of large image files, at least to ensure no OutOfMemoryError
can occur.\
- add a generic system to rely on browser rendering when image format is
not supported by YaCy, as it is done today, but only for gif and svg
