Do any of you work at Instagram?

The \"dnalounge\" Instagram account was created by one of my employees
years ago, but none of us can remember who that was, or what email
address they used.

I jumped through the hoops
[here](https://help.instagram.com/contact/524307401044321), including
sending them a scan of a utility bill and whatnot. The first time they
flat-out ignored me. The second time they wrote back, but after three
go-rounds with the support drone, they basically told me, \"if you
don\'t know the email address, go fuck yourself.\"

So who can reset this damned account?
