English â€¢ YaCy heuristics : extend with RSS-Bridge
==================================================

Hi, maybe you know YaCy Heuristics feature (/ConfigHeuristics\_p.html) :
it allows you to feed YaCy search results from external websites
supporting [OpenSearch](http://www.opensearch.org/){.postlink}.\
This feature looks interesting but if you tried to play with it you may
have soon realized it has quite a limited use : YaCy only support
OpenSearch results in RSS or Atom feed formats but most websites
offering OpenSearch only return results in HTML.\
\
Example from Twitter
[opensearch.xml](https://twitter.com/opensearch.xml){.postlink} :

Code: 
:   `<Url type="text/html" method="get" template="https://twitter.com/search?q={searchTerms}"/>`

\
\
Unfortunately, OpenSearch results in HTML are not standardized, so if
you want a program to be able to use it, you have to write a custom
parser for each website. So gentle websites should also provide
OpenSearch results in RSS or Atom if they want visitors to easily plug
any program they want on their results (WordPress.com is a good example.
See their [OpenSearch
description](https://s1.wp.com/opensearch.xml){.postlink})\... But that
not the case for many wesites I checked.\
\
Here come to rescue a project like
[RSS-Bridge](https://github.com/sebsauvage/rss-bridge){.postlink}.
Volunteers contributors are providing mappings from web APIs to RSS or
Atom feeds. All you need is to install a PHP enabled web server and
launch your RSS-Bridge instance.\
\
So with YaCy, resumed architecture will be : user search -\> YaCy server
(heuristics enabled) -\> RSS-Bridge -\> External website\
\
Here are the required setup steps :\
1. Install a web server supporting PHP : for example Apache with the PHP
module enabled\
2. Get latest sources from <https://github.com/sebsauvage/rss-bridge>\
3. Extract it to a suitable directory : for example /var/www/html for a
Debian Apache\
4. Eventually set needed permissions : for example chown www-data \...
for a Debian Apache\
5. Check rss-bridge is working at <http://your_host/rss-bridge/>, and
verify search is working for the bridge you are interested in\
6. Eventually modify rss-bridge/whitelist.txt file to enable a specific
bridge\
7. Go to your YaCy /ConfigHeuristics\_p.html page : tick \"opensearch
load external search result list from active systems below\" checkbox\
8. Add one or more bridge URLs : any title and comment you wish, and URL
copied from a rss-bridge search result. Example (searching yacy on
Twitter Bridge) :

Code: 
:   `http://your_host/rss-bridge/?action=display&bridge=TwitterBridge&q=yacy&format=AtomFormat`

.\
9. Important : replace your search term with {searchTerms} to make a
valid OpenSearch URL or it won\'t work. Example :

Code: 
:   `http://your_host/rss-bridge/?action=display&bridge=TwitterBridge&q={searchTerms}&format=AtomFormat`

\
10. That\'s it! Now heuristics results from the bridge may appear in
your 20 first YaCy search results (with H favicon left from some search
result entries).
