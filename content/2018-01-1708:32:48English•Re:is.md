Hi ircamb,\
indeed Snapshots is an interesting feature, but currently not very well
documented and has not very good cross-platform support.\
\
A few explanations however :\
- Snapshots can be stored as XML metadata, PDF rendering of a crawled
page, and JPEG or PNG thumbnail generated from PDF rendering\
- snaphots can be created :\
- for your own crawls using the \"Snapshot Creation\" section in the
advanced crawler (/CrawlStartExpert.html page)\
- on the fly for authenticated users calling the API /api/snapshot.jpg
or /api/snapshot.pdf (you can try this API call for example by opening
one of your \"XML Snapshot\" links and replace \".xml\" by \".pdf\")\
- a Snaphot link can be displayed in search results, only when a
Snapshot file (either XML metadata, PDF rendering or JPEG/PNG thumbnail)
is existing in the snapshots repository file system
(DATA/HTCACHE/snapshots)\
\
Having only \"XML Snapshot\" links in your results suggests that XML
metadata snapshots have been successfully generated in at least one of
your crawls, but that PDF and thumbnail generation failed.\
For PDF Snapshots to be rendered, you must install some supplementary
tools depending on your operating system (see prerequisites
documentation in [YaCy
sources](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/Release_1.92/source/net/yacy/cora/util/Html2Image.java#L60){.postlink}
:\
- on Debian or other Linux distros : you must install the following
packages : wkhtmltopdf imagemagick xvfb ghostscript\
- on Mac OS : you must install the following tools : wkhtmltopdf
imagemagick ghostscript\
- on Windows : as far as I know, the rendering of PDF Snapshots is not
supported (JPEG/PNG thumbnails from PDFs should work, but it is useless
as it depends on PDF rendering first)\
\
I hope you will have some luck with this, don\'t hesitate to report here
the results of your trials.\
Have a nice day.
