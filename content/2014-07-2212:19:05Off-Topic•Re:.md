He\'s good but he\'s nothing without a team.\
Many in Brazil say that this was [the selfie
team]{style="font-style: italic"}: it seems they were more worried in
taking selfies and perform well on the social networks than in the

they were playing some kind of religious, nationalist act, not just play
a good football.\
I totally agree with Lotthar Mattäus when he says the Brazilian team
cried too much, as if they were babys, not men.
