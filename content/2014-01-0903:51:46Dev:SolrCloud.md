start of a SolrCloud installation documentation

**Neue Seite**

<div>

This is an advanced \[\[Dev:Solr Solr for YaCy\]\] installation which
uses the SolrCloud architecture. If you want to read and understand
this, you should be (at least a little bit) familiar with debian, Solr
and tomcat.\
\
In this example, we install a shard of 4 Solr instances within the same
server.\
\
===== Tomcat Installation =====\
We will install tomcat as a standard debian system service using apt:\
apt-get install tomcat6 tomcat6-examples tomcat6-admin tomcat6-docs\
The tomcat web service on port 8080 will start automatically and you can
open the default page at http://localhost:8080\
The optional packages tomcat6-examples tomcat6-admin tomcat6-docs are
great to develop and test applications, but it is also possible to omit
them. If you installed the optional packages, then you can test them:\
\* http://localhost:8080/docs/ is the online-documentation\
\* http://localhost:8080/examples/ links to a set of example tomcat
applications\
\* http://localhost:8080/manager/html and
http://localhost:8080/host-manager/html are tomcat management
applications but their access is restricted. To use them you must set a
password in /etc/tomcat6/tomcat-users.xml, like\
\<?xml version=\'1.0\' encoding=\'utf-8\'?\>\
\<tomcat-users\>\
\<role rolename=\"admin\"/\>\
\<role rolename=\"admin-gui\"/\>\
\<role rolename=\"manager\"/\>\
\<role rolename=\"manager-gui\"/\>\
\<user username=\"admin\" password=\"tomcat\"
roles=\"admin,admin-gui,manager,manager-gui\"/\>\
\</tomcat-users\>\
After setting this, you must restart tomcat with\
/etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart\
and then you can log in the \[\[http://localhost:8080/manager/html
manager\]\] and \[\[http://localhost:8080/host-manager/html
host-manager\]\] servlet with the user \'admin\' and the password
\'tomcat\'. Please replace the default password \'tomcat\' with your
own.\
\
The relevant paths for the result of this installation are:\
tomcat users: /etc/tomcat6/tomcat-users.xml\
CATALINA\_HOME: /usr/share/tomcat6\
CATALINA\_BASE: /var/lib/tomcat6\
default web page: /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/ROOT/index.html\
\
===== Zookeeper Installation =====\
The SolrCloud peers need a common configuration system which is provided
by zookeeper. Zookeeper can be installed with\
apt-get install zookeeper zookeeperd\
This will create a new user named \'zookeeper\'. The relevant paths are
at\
Zookeeper config: /etc/zookeeper/conf (linked to
/etc/zookeeper/conf\_example)\
Zookeeper data: /var/lib/zookeeper/\
Zookeeper binary: /usr/share/zookeeper/\
To check if Zookeeper is running, start the Zookeeper shell:\
/usr/share/zookeeper/bin/zkCli.sh\
and run shell scripts like\
ls /\
ls /zookeeper\
\
===== Solr and Zookeeper Installation =====\
Download a solr release from http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ i.e.\
cd /var/lib/tomcat6/\
wget
http://apache.mirrors.spacedump.net/lucene/solr/4.6.0/solr-4.6.0.tgz\
tar xfz solr-4.6.0.tgz\
cp solr-4.6.0/dist/solr-4.6.0.war webapps/\
Before solr can be fully deployed, we must create a solr index schema.
This is taken from YaCy\
\
===== YaCy Installation =====\
Download a YaCy tarball from http://yacy.net or from an update server
like http://latest.yacy.net
