Dear friends,\
\
I contact you regarding this topic. With my father and a developper
we\'ve financed the development of a company search engine.\
WE HAVE lots of appointments and our clients (Famous french groups) have
important needs of what we are offering them.\
We built everything inspiring ourselves from Yacy.\
\
Now our search engine starts to work but we need some skills for the
scalability. So if one of you feels he can manage a big project we would
be glad to go further.\
Don\'t hesitate to contact me <jc.gryson@gmail.com>\
\
Regards,
