Considering that the server where Yacy is running is an Ubuntu 14.04
Server (64 bit), has 2 GB RAM and 2GB of Swap, can I increase
javastart\_Xmx and javastart\_Xms above the 2GB limit of RAM and use up
to 4 GB (2 GB RAM + 2 GB Swap)?\
\
Based on Sixcooler words, I would expect to see a heavy usage of my
server\'s swap partition, but that\'s not what these graphs show:\

Should some setting be turned on so that solr makes use of virtual RAM?
