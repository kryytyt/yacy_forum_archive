*We have to deal with these entitled, lying shitheels at the club and
restaurant all the time. It is especially infuriating at the club,
because \-- in my humble but correct opinion \-- bringing a dog into a
nightclub is just straight-up animal abuse. That animal is going to go
**deaf**. So our staff strictly comply with the letter of the law \--
and ensure that these people do as well. After their little snookums has
inevitably hopped up onto the bar, humped a stranger\'s leg, or run
wild, this usually results in a 30 minute conversation ending with,
\"You are welcome to sue us, or call the police, but right now, you have
to leave.\" So far, they\'ve been all bark and no bite.*
