Enable HTTP Digest authentication for non admin users.

Also ensure authentication is not lost by Digest timeout when navigating
between index.html and search results page.

This way, running searches with extended features on a remote peer or a
password protected peer works with a regular user (with "Extended
search" rights). 
When authenticating on the search page with a user without "Extended
search" rights, it appears as authenticated, but has just its usual
access to the public search features.
