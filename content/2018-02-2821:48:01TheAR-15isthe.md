[Pennsylvania church plans ceremony with AR-15 rifles, prompting nearby
elementary school to relocate
students:](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-pennsylvania-church-ar-15-rifle-ceremony-20180227-story.html)

> School officials told parents that their children will be relocated
> for the day Wednesday to accommodate a nearby church planning a
> wedding-like ceremony involving AR-15 semiautomatic rifles. \[\...\]
>
> The World Peace and Unification Sanctuary, also known as the Sanctuary
> Church, is led by the son of the late Rev. Sun Myung Moon, a
> self-professed messiah from Korea who became a symbol of the 1970s
> cult wars by holding mass weddings for couples who often were
> strangers. Moon, who founded the Unification Church, became a player
> in a segment of the American conservative world through business
> interests including the Washington Times, and his son Hyung Jin Moon
> has woven gun rights into the religious community he leads in
> Pennsylvania, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which
> tracks hate groups and calls Hyung Jin Moon an \"anti-LGBT cult
> leader.\"
>
> The church\'s website calls for \"heterosexual couples\" who believe
> that Hyung Jin Moon is the representative and heir of his messiah
> father to participate in a historic \"Perfection Stage Book of Life
> Registration Blessing\" - either in Newfoundland or \"at other
> locations via the Internet.\" The site calls the service at 10 a.m.
> Wednesday the \"Cosmic True Parents of Heaven, Earth and Humanity
> Cheon Il Guk Book of Life Registration Blessing\" ceremony. \"True
> Parents\" was the term Sun Myung Moon\'s many followers called him and
> his wife. The SPLC site says \"Cheon Il Guk\" is the church\'s name
> for \"a sovereign kingdom of heaven on earth\" - that must be
> defended, \"which is where the assault rifles come in,\" the center\'s
> site says.
>
> \"Blessed couples are requested to bring the accoutrements of the
> nation of Cheon Il Guk, crowns representing the sovereignty of Kings
> and Queens, and a \'rod of iron,\' designated by the Second King as an
> AR15 semiautomatic rifle or equivalents such as an AK semiautomatic
> rifle, representing both the intent and the ability to defend one\'s
> family, community and \'nation of Cheon Il Guk,\' \" the church\'s
> site says in a statement. Hyung Jin calls himself \"Second King,\" the
> SPLC reports.
>
> If couples can\'t bring the guns because of legal problems \"or other
> reasons,\" they are \"invited to purchase a \$700 gift certificate
> from a gun store, as evidence of their intent to purchase a \'rod of
> iron\' in the future,\" the church\'s site says. \"These actions to
> participate with crowns and a rod of iron/gift certificate are signs
> of attendance, sovereignty and vigilance to protect God\'s coming
> nation.\"

You know, you can\'t have a strip club anywhere near an elementary
school, but they\'ll let you put a church just *anywhere*.

**Update:** Most of the other articles left out the second half of the
grift! [They actually *sell them the
guns:*](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/pennsylvania/pennsylvania-church-blessing-ar-15-guns-rifles-poconos-20180228.html)

> Hyung Jin \"Sean\" Moon is pastor of the World Peace and Unification
> Sanctuary in this small town in rural Wayne County, 120 miles north of
> Philadelphia. His brother, Moon Kook-jin, also known as Justin Moon,
> owns Kahr Arms, a firearms manufacturing company 30 minutes away in
> Pike County. \[\...\]
>
> Anyone without an AR-15 could buy one at Kahr Arms. \"I actually
> purchased my weapon there yesterday because, although I have several
> rifles, I didn\'t have an AR-15,\" said David Konn, a follower who had
> driven from Florida earlier in the week. \"I think it retails for
> \$689.\" \[\...\]
>
> On Monday, Justin Moon told the Inquirer and Daily News that his
> firearms company, which has sold weapons to police departments across
> the country, was merely a sponsor of the Festival of Grace. He attends
> the church.
>
> \"We sell a few guns,\" he said. \"That\'s no secret. That\'s my
> profession. I\'m a gun manufacturer, so I support the Second and First
> Amendment.\"
