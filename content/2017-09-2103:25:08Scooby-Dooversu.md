Dear Lazyweb, I have a request.

As you know, the primary [lesson of
*Scooby-Doo*](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/11/scooby-doo-and-secular-humanism/)
is that ghosts and monsters don\'t exist, it\'s always, *always* a shady
real-estate speculator wearing a rubber mask.

Please combine all of [these
videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?q=every+scooby+doo+unmasking&sp=EgIQAVAU)
of supercuts of the Scooby Gang unmasking, and photoshop Donald Trump\'s
cartoon face onto all of the villains.

I thank you. Future generations thank you. And most of all, those
meddling kids thank you.
