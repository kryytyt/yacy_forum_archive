I noticed the same problems a year or two back when I tested YaCy. As it
approached the upper memory limit it suddenly crashed or became very
unstable. I was hoping the bug would be fixed.

I am about to do an install on a 32 bit 3 GB Ram P4 3.0 Ghz Linux
install and will test and see if I run into the same thing.
