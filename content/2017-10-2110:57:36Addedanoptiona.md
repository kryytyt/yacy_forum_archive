Added an optional login link/status to the search public top nav bar.

Thus allowing a more convenient way (wihout the need to go to the admin
section) to login when searching on your remote or password protected
peer and benefit from extended search features such as Heuristics,
Bookmarking or JavasScript resorting.

Can be disabled using the ConfigSearchPage_p.html.
