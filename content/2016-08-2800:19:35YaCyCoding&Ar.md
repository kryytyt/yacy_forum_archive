YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: YaCy Release 1.90

My last knowledge about the data folder on Mac OS X is, that the YaCy
Mac app wrote it\'s data folder to \~/Library/YaCy/DATA\
That is also documented in [http://www.yacy-websuche.de/wiki/index. \...
FirstStart](http://www.yacy-websuche.de/wiki/index.php/De:FirstStart){.postlink}\
I don\'t know where that changed. But I consider that this would be a
good practice. Is that possible?\
\
I believe the fact that we have a Mac release again is a very good
reason to have another main release soon with it!
