I\'ve just scheduled a process to recrawl all index at 00:00 am every
day.
![:shock:](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif "Shocked")\
\
But I\'ve noticed that when you recrawl the index is canceled. Could be
useful a way to add only new pages to database without deleting the old
index.\
\
I.e. 1) you recrawl; 2) the robot finds new pages; 3) it adds new pages
to archive and deletes not working ones.\
\
Yes, a new specific page where you may edit a list of webpages to
mantain updated would be great.\
\
My Yacy engine is: <http://irnerio.sabatino.pro> and is a search engine
on the topic of Italian law.\
