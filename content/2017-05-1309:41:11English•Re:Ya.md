Hi eros,\
the error you report suggests there might be a leak somewhere in YaCy
(maybe some missing InputStream.close() or OuputStream.close()
instructions) or a too low \"file-max\" setting on you machine (I guess
you already checked \"/proc/sys/fs/file-max\" and ulimit, but checking
\"/proc/sys/fs/file-nr\" when YaCy is running could also be
interesting).\
\
I am not sure this is directly related to your new memory setting. Maybe
it was rather caused by the fact that you stopped the server while
running a large crawl.\
\
Which version do you use : 1.92/9000?\
\
Did you try to remove part or all files from your
\"/usr/share/yacy/DATA/INDEX/freeworld/QUEUES/CrawlerLimitStacks\"
folder (after eventually backing them up for later re-insert)?\
\
There is also a setting that might help you in yacy.conf :
\"crawler.onDemandLimit\". Its default value is 1000, meaning that when
more than 1000 hosts are in the crawler stack, each queue backing file
will be open, read and closed each time it is needed rather than loading
in memory only once. Maybe increasing this value could help you,
moreover with the large memory available you have.\
\
[Edit :]{style="font-weight: bold"} if you can check your logs around
the \"HTTP ERROR 500\" log trace there may be additional details that
could be aslo interesting.\
\
Best regards
