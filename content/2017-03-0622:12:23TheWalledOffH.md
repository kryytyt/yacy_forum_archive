> The Piano Bar
>
> Britain got its hands on Palestine in 1917 and the piano bar is themed
> as a colonial outpost from those heady days. It is equipped with
> languid ceiling fans, leather bound couches and an air of undeserved
> authority. Guests can peruse a collection of Banksy artworks that
> include vandalised oil paintings and statues choking on tear gas
> fumes. Warm scones and freshly brewed tea are served daily on fine
> bone china.

> Is there a swimming pool on the roof?

> No. Our proximity to the wall means nobody is permitted to go on the
> roof without prior permission from the Israeli military. You should
> exercise common sense when staying with us. Aggressive drunkenness or
> loud public nudity is not encouraged. Under no circumstances should
> you shine laser pens at the army watchtowers.
