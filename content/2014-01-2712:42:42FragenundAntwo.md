Hi davidk,\
\
i think you are right in many o fyour points.\
\
I think it would be good to provide different configurations.\
e.g.:\
- just searching\
- just DHT\
- just crawling\
- combinations of the upper ones\
\
and each one for different memorysizes\
\
The normal home user might just want to search.\
\
My conclusions on stability:\
- never use the dev versions\
- oracle java seems to run more stable then icedtea\
- when crawling you have to reduce crawling speed to a point where the
io is less then 100% of what the disks can manage /Performance\_p.html\
- when crawling my yacy was crashing within 5 days with a chanche of
100%\
\
My current stragedy:\
- just DHT distribution\
- set timeout for DHT to 1000ms /PerformanceQueues\_p.html\
- just 10000 words in wordcache /PerformanceQueues\_p.html\
- runs stable for over two weeks with just 1G RAM and currently 11Mio.

\
NoGos wich should get fixed:\
- yacy eating up ram und stalling with 100% cpu utilization\
\-- perhaps some kind of watchdog wich tries to restart yacy and sens
mail if problem occurs more the x times in x days / hours\
- yacy not starting again with same amount of ram it ran before, cause
this normaly means you are loosing your index

\
Communication in the forum should be english in general. I think most
people writing in german just because it\'s easier.\
\
To summarize: It would be nice to develop yacy more like a product.
Perhaps it would be an idea to provide a out of the box version like
openelec does for xbmc. So you can ran yacy in an special configurated
VM.
