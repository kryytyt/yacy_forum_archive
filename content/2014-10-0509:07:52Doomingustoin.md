You\'ll be happy to know that this weekend I\'ve dragged XScreenSaver
kicking and screaming into 2003 and have made all the hacks that load
text able to properly display UTF-8 input, and it\'s even anti-aliased.

But don\'t worry: while doing so, it still parses HTML using regular
expressions. I would never re-make a classic hit like that.
