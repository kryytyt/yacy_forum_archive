The elite belief in Uberized, Muskized cities is at odds with fundamental, irrefutable facts of geometry

> Walker\'s overarching thesis is that city transit is undermined by
> \"elite projection,\" where rich people pretend that the way they like
> getting around \-- in private vehicles that go from door to door \--
> can possibly work at urban scale, despite the fact that simple
> geometry shows that this is a physical impossibility.
>
> As in, \"It doesn\'t matter how tightly you pack self-driving Ubers
> together on our roads. If all the people who make your coffee and
> empty your wastebin are in private vehicles rather than on buses and
> trains, the roads will be at 5 or 10 times their physical capacity.\"
> \[\...\] These all share the geometric flaw: even the smallest cars,
> packed as tightly as possible, multiplied by all the people who rely
> on buses and trains, will overflow all the roads we have now and all
> the roads we could ever build.
>
> There is another flaw: when you make it cheaper to ride private
> vehicles (rather than public transit), you siphon transit riders out
> of the buses and trains, and put them on the roads, increasing
> congestion: so adding \"efficient rideshares\" actually makes transit
> worse, not better
>
> Walker tried to explain this to Elon Musk on Twitter \[\...\] Musk
