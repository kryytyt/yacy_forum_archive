> There\'s rising worry that corporations are taking over America. But
> after reviewing a slew of the bids by cities and states wooing
> Amazon\'s massive second headquarters, I don\'t think \"takeover\"
> quite captures what\'s going on.
>
> More like \"surrender.\"
>
> Chicago has offered to let Amazon pocket \$1.32 billion in income
> taxes paid by its own workers. This is truly perverse. Called a
> personal income-tax diversion, the workers must still pay the full
> taxes, but instead of the state getting the money to use for schools,
> roads or whatever, Amazon would get to keep it all instead.
>
> \"The result is that workers are, in effect, paying taxes to their
> boss,\" says a report on the practice from Good Jobs First, a think
> tank critical of many corporate subsidies. \[\...\]
>
> The most far-reaching offer is from Fresno, California. That city of
> half a million isn\'t offering any tax breaks. Instead it has a novel
> plan to give Amazon special authority over how the company\'s taxes
> are spent.
>
> Fresno promises to funnel 85 percent of all taxes and fees generated
> by Amazon into a special fund. That money would be overseen by a
> board, half made up of Amazon officers, half from the city. They\'re
> supposed to spend the money on housing, roads and parks in and around
> Amazon. \[\...\]
>
> Is it even legal to give a company direct sway over civic spending
> like that? When asked about it, Fresno\'s economic-development
> director threw the public interest under the bus.
>
> \"Rather than the money disappearing into a civic black hole, Amazon
> would have a say on where it will go,\" he told the Los Angeles Times.
> \"Not for the fire department on the fringe of town, but to enhance
> their own investment in Fresno.\"
>
> You poor fools out on the fringe of town. All this time you\'ve been
> paying your taxes, thinking it was for the broader public good.
> Suckers.
