> The Nakagin Capsule Tower was portrayed in the media as a sign of
> \'the capsule era\'. With its avant-garde aesthetic it proposed a
> mutant quality, offering the opportunity of adaptation over time.
> Theoretically it increased the ability to configure the building to a
> world accelerating towards a post-industrial society; the icon was
> quickly labelled \'the future of housing\'. It was the tallest
> building in the block. Visible from afar, with its sci-fi appearance,
> the tower stood near the highway like a machine from the future.

> The individual capsules don\'t have hot water supply. For bathing, the
> options are either to get a water heater on your own, or to use the
> communal shower on the entrance floor. Most residents opt for the
> second option. After the degradation of the pipes, a few years ago a
> new network of pipelines was installed. The rotted pipes have led to
> numerous leaks. Many of the capsules were thus unusable, rotting from
> the inside. Moreover, the renovation works were done without much
> care: doors were sawn into so as to pass and connect the new pipes. It
> seems that with every repair, the building is falls further into
> disrepair. \[\...\]
>
> Emergency exits were transformed into smoking rooms with ashtrays and
> chairs. Up the stairs you will find clothes hanging on wires, shoe
> cabinets, shelves with old and mouldy books, sets of boxes, huge
> suitcases, bikes and even fences around the doors. The balcony on the
> third floor, above the office level, is an abandoned platform. Dirty
> water and rotten capsule remnants are its sole contents.
>
> More than half of the capsules are abandoned and many are \'sealed\'
> from the outside, due to the risks they present. Others, however, do
> not even have locks and it is easy to enter and see the insides in
> varying degrees of advanced decomposition: walls are coming off and
> there is garbage, mould and moisture everywhere. From the emergency
> stairs on the outside you can see that the capsules are slowly
> rotting.
