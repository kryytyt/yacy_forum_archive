> the Daily Caller, a far-right news website whose frequent
> misinformation and lies keep fact-checking website Snopes rather busy.
>
> I know! Who cares about being in cahoots with a publication that
> celebrated Obama commuting the sentence of Chelsea Manning this week
> with the headline \"Genetic Male Bradley Manning Pulls Off The Klinger
> Gambit,\" right? Not me!
>
> Not to be left out of the action, oil company BP was also a host. It
> was, according to the publication, \"A veritable who\'s who of beltway
> bigwigs\" at the Hay-Adams Hotel in DC, all talking Trump.

This is your irregularly-scheduled reminder:

If you work for Facebook, quit. It is morally indefensible for you to
use your skills to make that company more powerful. By working there,
you are making the world an objectively worse place. I\'m sure you can
find a job working for a company that you don\'t have to *apologize* for
all the time.

You can *do it*. I *believe* in you.
