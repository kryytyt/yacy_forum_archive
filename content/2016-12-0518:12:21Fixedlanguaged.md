Fixed language detector initialization and NullPointerException cases.

NullPointerException occurred when using and Identificator instance
which encountered and error in its constructor.
This error could be caused by a missing "langdetect" folder in the
current folder of the main process, or by simultaneous first calls to
the constructor, initializing concurrently the DetectorFactory.langlist.

Fixes the mantis 714 (http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=714)
