English â€¢ Re: How to configure yacy to search only for PDF files

Hi nergal,\
as you said, when searching you can restrict results to a given file
type using the \"Filetype\" facet or the \"filetype:\" operator.\
\
When crawling, as far as I know there is no option to directly filter on
a selection of file types or MIME types (yet it could be convenient),
but using a regular expression filter on document URL will do the job.
So for example for pdf files, I would suggest you to crawl the websites
your interested in with the following options in the Advanced Crawler
(CrawlStartExpert.html) :\
- Document Filter \> Filter on URLs \> must-match : .\*\\.pdf\
- Index Attributes \> Add Crawl result to collection(s) :
your\_pdf\_collection\_name\
\
Other options at default, or as you which. What is important here is to
use the \"Document Filter \> Filter on URLs\" option, and not the
\"Crawler Filter \> Load Filter on URLs\" one. Because that last one is
too restrictive as it would prevent the loader to parse html files and
follow their links, so the crawl task would rapidly terminate.\
\
Eventually using a custom collection name can later help you restrict
searches to your own pdf collection using the \"Collection\" facet or
the \"collection:\" operator.\
\
Have a nice day. Let us know if you somehow achieved what you want.
