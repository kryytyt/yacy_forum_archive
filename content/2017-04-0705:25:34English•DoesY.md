English â€¢ Does YaCy supports p2p over different net types?(i2p/tor/cl)
======================================================================

Hi all,\
I\'ve been reading docs and can\'t grasp the idea - suppose my node is
running as a tor hidden service and is not able to access clearnet, also
the crawling is limited to \*.onion only. So all my peers are eventually
discovered on tor.\
\
If there\'s also another network running in i2p, and another network
running on top of clearnet, and some of the nodes (not mine) are present
on 2 or 3 networks at some time (I believe its possible?), will I be
able to somehow utilize the benefit of having these peers to access the
data while not leaving the privacy of tor-only access for me? Or these
nodes and their content will be basically unavailable?\
\
How is YaCy supposed to work over mixed network types?
