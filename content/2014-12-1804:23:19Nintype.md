I bought this [crazy-assed replacement on-screen keyboard for
iOS](http://jormy.com/nintype/), and it\'s interesting, but after having
used it for a couple of days the primary effect I\'ve discovered is that
I\'m just *typing a lot less* because it\'s so fucking hard to do. I
guess I\'m giving up now.

I never got the hang of swiping with both thumbs: it seems like there\'s
a timeout where if you take too long between letters it decides you\'re
done? Or something? And when typing a long word, the whole keyboard gets
so covered with glowy Tron psychedelia that you can\'t even read the
keycaps any more. There are popup menus for correction where you\'re
expected to pull down then move left or right, and inevitably the thing
you\'re trying to find is occluded directly under your hand, no matter
which hand you use.

I remember finding on-screen keyboards initially incredibly frustrating,
but I don\'t think it was *this* frustrating. At this point I think what
I really want is just one that has much better text prediction. (the
stock iOS 8 keyboard is enormously better than iOS 7 in this regard.)
