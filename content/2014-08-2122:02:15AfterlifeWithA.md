![](http://www.jwz.org/images/alwarchie1ffvar.jpg)I just read the first
comp of *Afterlife With Archie*, and it\'s actually pretty good! And
man, it is *dark*.

Jughead\'s dog dies, and Sabrina the Teenage Witch uses the Necronomicon
to bring it back to life, unleashing a zombie apocalypse. Hijinks, as
they say, ensue.
