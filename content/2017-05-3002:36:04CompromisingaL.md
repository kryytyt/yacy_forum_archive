music files are based on compressed samples and are decoded with a bunch
of math. NSF music files, on the other hand, are played by actually
emulating the NES CPU and sound hardware in real

It is *amazing* that bank switching is the key to an exploit on modern
computers, however, it shouldn\'t really be all that surprising:
everyone knows that bank switching is what made the T-800 possible.
