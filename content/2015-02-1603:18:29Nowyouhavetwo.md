> Quick summary - it\'s a bug in the PCRE regex engine as used in Flash.
> Spoiler: it\'s exploitable. \[\...\]

> Below is what happens when we compile a regex that combines the \\c

> with a multibyte UTF-8 character. A simple trigger for the bug is
> \'\\\\c\\xd0\\x80+\', below. \[\...\]
>
> So clearly something has gone wrong\... The question is now how to
> leverage this invalid bytecode to get code execution.
