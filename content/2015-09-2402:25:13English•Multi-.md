English â€¢ Multi-threaded access to SOLR index and RAID1 load balancing
======================================================================

We can expect that a consistent portion of the major high-end YaCy nodes
out there with large indexes store their laboriously-crawled data into
some sort of redundant RAID, to prevent data corruption worth months of
crawling.\
\
In my particular node, I have a medium-sized index with 21M records
making up for 220GB of storage, mirrored on a two-disks software RAID1
driven by Linux md driver.\
The md RAID1 driver is capable of splitting concurrent read requests
across its component devices, thus increasing the read speed almost
proportionally to the number of devices.\
To take this advantage, however, md needs the requests to come from
different threads. If this is the case, the amount of IOPS across the
mirror can increase to appreciable values even for mechanical disks,
maybe high enough for YaCy to provide responsive local results in a
\"realtime\" delay.\
\
However, running a YaCy search query on the local index does not appear
to distribute the load across the RAID devices; one of the two disks
receives 10 times more read requests than the other, as reported by
\`atop\`. For this, it appears that YaCy (SOLR) performs most of the
intensive index reads from a single thread, and doesn\'t take advantage
of the full hardware potential, which could be multiple times higher on
large RAID setups.\
\
If this is correct, how could the issue be worked around?
