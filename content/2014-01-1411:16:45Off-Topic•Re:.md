Hi nicolas, I would be really happy to being able to join/create
international YaCy communities.\

Well, it\'s less an \'academic\' decision but just a simple confession
that we are not able to do this. Check the necessities:\
- the forum owner (I) must be able to understand whats written inside
the forum (at least for legal reasons), therefore beeing able to
understand the languag\
- otherwise the forum owner must assign a language-specific
administrator to care for the content, quality, kindness and spam which
he can trust\
- the forum owner must administrate the forum-specific administration
rights and supervise if the forum moderator is doing something at all\
\
At this time, there is not someone who shouts \'I want to be the spanish
forums moderator\'. Furthermore, if that moderator disappears, the forum
must be closed (

)\
That means: if there is somewhone who wants to commit him/herself that
much he/she might be able to run the forum for themself.\

Yes! Thats actually really bad but that is is all about: distribution!
Take away the work from the core devs so they can care about
development, not community communication moderation. Go for it!\

\
Yes! And that will be also the case if the language-specific forum is
\_inside\_ ours here, which will make it even worse.\

Maybe you are a candidate to run a spanish forum? please!
