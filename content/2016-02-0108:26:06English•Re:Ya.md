English â€¢ Re: YaCy as ZeroNet search engine

Good idea you had to use the cache!\
\
For now I imagine 2 solutions for better indexing ZeroNet :\
- Generic : optionally use a browser engine rendering instead of raw
html when crawling with YaCy. This would benefit for any dynamically
filled website. For example JavaFX has a WebKit based component to
include rendered HTML supporting Javascript and CSS :
[http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/webview \...
ebview.htm](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/webview/jfxpub-webview.htm){.postlink}\
- ZeroNet specific : customize YaCy to make use of their API to
correctly parse links. I don\'t know if their API already includes what
would be needed ([http://zeronet.readthedocs.org/en/lates \...
reference/](http://zeronet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/){.postlink})
