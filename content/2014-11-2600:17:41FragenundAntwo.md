[\...additional to the last post, following
observation:]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
\
Yacy runs in this case at a RaspberryPi since some days. Without
crawling and without solr. This Yacy is connected to an other solr at an
other Linux system. This Yacy runs really fine and the response times at
the user web front end is suprising good,
[but:]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
\
- Without Yacy, the OS inclusive a running htop needs 82MByte of RAM.\
\
- If I look with htop and subtract this basic load from the current used
378MByte of RAM, so Yacy uses in this moment 296MByte of physical RAM
(484MByte).\
\
- xmx was set to 220MByte\
\
The page status.html shows:\
- RAM used 92,12MB\
- RAM max 212,75MB\
\
At performance\_p.html the parameter \"RAM disable DHT-in below\" was
set to 150MB. The physical RAM of this system is 484MByte but the
[DHT-in disable]{style="font-style: italic"} is not yet triggered.\
\
How I have to understand these values?\
\
Does it be important that this system knows a swap file of 999MByte?
(but it uses in this moment only 2MByte of this)\
\
How are the really coherences between these memory values?\
\
Best regards, Frank
