Hi biolizard89\
\
\
I think, your concept of distributing ranking-algorithms, rather than
exchanging data itselves (with all their privacy- and spam- concerns),
might open a new door to look for alternative types of solutions aiming
for the improvement of ranking-algorithms \...
![:?](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif "Confused")\
\
\
Trying to bring things, thoughts, knowledge and discussion together:\
\
A fully centralized approach is the domain of commercial SE\'s. It
doesn\'t care much of privacy, but it supports best BIG-DATA anylytics
in order to develop \'most-optimal\' rankings in terms of customer
satisfaction and commercial interests.\
\
A \'cooperative approach\' relying on centralized data, resulted in a
crucial loss of privacy - or, in an increased risk of getting spammed
and tampered with disinforming data, respectively. Obviously, we don\'t
see any great solutions coming for that.\
\
A \'cooperative approach\', based on social graphs and using a
restricted data exchange, might bring most of needs for privacy and
data-secuity into balance. However, it is yet to be operationalized
fully.\
\
A pure algorithmic approach - this idea came up for me, when thinking
about your concept of exchanging algorhithms - could provide all
intelligence locally. It would not be restricted to influence processes
at query-time, but it also might influence an (local?) index, by trying
to avoid fetching and indexing false-positive hits. Ranking algoritms
might be choosen explicitely by the user, or elected (or even trained)
by the local search- & find- history. In such a scenario, the
development focus shifted towards the competition of exchangeable
\'intelligent\' algorithm plugins - avoiding to get stuck with
ambiguities of clustering, disinformation, and privacy, which can be
considered typical side-effects of centralized data-store analytics.\
\
The approaches mentioned last, might make use of YaCy\'s query-log, and
be realized on the browser\'s side by \"Greasemonkey\" (or sthg.
similar, however, restricting it\'s use to firefox and chrome by now),
and on some logic preserved by the server.\
\
\
Did you miss some relevant views/issues/points within this try of a
review?\
