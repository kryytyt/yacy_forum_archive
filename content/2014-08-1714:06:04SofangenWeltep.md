> had donated this morning, and the chlorine sprayers used to disinfect
> the bodies of those who die here, all the while hollering that Ebola
> is a hoax.\

> Jemimah Kargbo, a health care worker at a clinic next door, said they
> took mattresses and bedding, utensils and plastic chairs. "Everybody
> left with their own thing," she said. "What are they carrying to their
> homes? They are carrying their deaths."
