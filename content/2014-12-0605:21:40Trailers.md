No shits given for the Star Wars or Avengers trailers, but the
Terminator trailer looks promising!

If I were a self-replicating AI, I wouldn\'t house myself inside some

Why does Ultron\'s itty bitty head on his gigantic robot body have its
own helmet? *Whyyyyyy??* Is he like that bug that impersonates fish
tongues?
