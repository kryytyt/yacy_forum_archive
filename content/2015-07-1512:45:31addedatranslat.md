``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
added a translation from /location=bbox to a twitter-like
near:location-name query. This causes that scraping tweets from twitter
when zooming into a map actually queries only tweets from that section
of the map. Example query:
http://localhost:9000/api/search.json?source=twitter&q=biergarten%2B%2Flocation%3D8.4979248046875,50.516919485758045,12.02178955078125,52.10481822023322
translates into
biergarten near:"GÃ¶ttingen" within:121mi
for twitter
```
