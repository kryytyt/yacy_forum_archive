[What I saw at the Michigan
recount:](https://medium.com/@nick_sharp/what-i-saw-at-the-michigan-recount-7c46fdc87243#.5oc80wq55)

> On December 7, 2016, I volunteered as an observer with Recount
> Michigan 2016. I showed up at 9:00am sharp in the heart of Detroit, in
> heavily democratic Wayne County, Michigan.
>
> It was a bloodbath.
>
> I did not count a single vote during my entire first four-hour shift.
>
> Trump\'s legal team was there in force, circling the room like sharks.
> They were challenging everything, gumming up the works and
> disqualifying whole precincts. I was only aware of a single Green
> Party attorney plus one law student in my (large) room. Many
> challenges had one or more Trump lawyers speaking with election
> officials, and no legal advocate present for the other side; they were
> simply outnumbered and outgunned.
>
> Every recount table had 1 \-- 2 Trump observers present, each one
> holding written scripts to challenge every single precinct, regardless
> of the facts.

[Why Every American Should Care About Michigan\'s Canceled
Recount:](https://medium.com/@bethmartinez/why-every-american-should-care-about-michigans-canceled-recount-3cacf201c0f7#.ebuy6awo4)

> As as the Michigan recount is being stalled in courts, it has become
> clear that 75,000 votes in the counties with highly Democratic
> populations came back with no vote for President \-- but with votes
> for candidates lower down the ballot. This is what is referred to as
> an \"undervote\" and is largely attributed to malfunctioning ballot
> reader machines. In a state that Trump won by 11,000 votes, this large
> number of undervotes could easily change the outcome of who won here.
>
> Incredibly, Michigan laws prohibit a recount if there are
> discrepancies in reconciling the numbers of votes against the poll
> books. Which is insane, of course. In a Catch 22 move, these wonky
> recount laws disallow a recount for the very reasons that a recount
> would be justified: \"a precinct is ineligible to be recounted if the
> \'number of ballots to be recounted and the number of ballots issued
> on election day as shown on the poll list or the computer printout do
> not match and the difference is not explained to the satisfaction of
> the board of canvassers.\'\" If someone wanted to skew an election,
> all they would have to do is add or remove a few ballots so the poll
> books don\'t match the number of votes, and there can be no recount.
>
> Most of the mismatched poll books are in Wayne County, a heavily
> Democratic area with a population of over 1.7 million people.
> According to Detroit\'s election director, eighty-seven of Wayne
> County\'s decade-old voting machines broke on election day.

[Donald Trump lost the popular vote in last month\'s US presidential
election by a bigger margin than any other US president in
history.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-lost-popular-vote-hillary-clinton-us-election-president-history-a7470116.html)

> The Republican is currently trailing Democrat rival Hillary Clinton by
> 2.8 million votes as the last remaining postal ballots are counted \--
> despite him winning the November 8 election because of the Electoral
> College system.
>
> That deficit is more than five times bigger than the 544,000 by which
> George W. Bush lost to Al Gore in 2000 - the second biggest popular
> vote deficit in history for a candidate who has still gone on to
> become President. \[\...\]
>
> In 2012 Mr Trump called the Electoral College \"a disaster for
> democracy\" after mistakenly thinking it would lead to President Obama
> losing the popular vote but retaining the White House.
>
> Following his election victory, however, the billionaire businessman
> praised the \"genius\" of the system.

[CIA assessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win White
House:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html)

> \"It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia\'s

[Mitch McConnell, whose wife was offered a cabinet position, covered it
up:](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/10/opinions/how-politicians-let-russia-hack-americas-election-waldman/)

> The Post told of an extraordinary meeting on Capitol Hill in
> mid-September, when FBI Director James Comey, Secretary of Homeland
> Security Jeh Johnson and other officials met with the leadership of
> both parties. They made the case for a bipartisan statement sending a
> warning to Russia that such actions would not be tolerated.
>
> But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put the kibosh on it.
>
> So the White House backed down, apparently to avoid being seen as
> trying to aid Clinton\'s campaign. \[\...\]
>
> Confronted with an attack by a hostile foreign power on our most
> critical institutions, Republicans decided that Russian hacking was
> OK, as long as it was against Democrats \-- indeed, as Wikileaks
> strategically released the hacked emails over a period of weeks for
> maximum political impact, Republicans celebrated. \[\...\]
>
> And Democrats, including Barack Obama, didn\'t have the courage to
> stand up to them.
>
> We think of American democracy as the most stable and secure in the

[Trump doesn\'t need daily intelligence briefings because he\'s
smart:](http://crooksandliars.com/2016/12/you-know-im-smart-person)

> \"I\'m, like, a smart person. I don\'t have to be told the same thing
> in the same words every single day for the next eight years. Could be
> eight years. Could be eight years.\"
>
> Trump\'s disinterest in keeping up-to-date on important security
> information is the most profound abrogation of responsibility ever
> exhibited by a person about to take command of our nuclear codes and
> the combined might of our military.
>
> Pence being given the PDB is not a sufficient replacement. No
> President has ever turned over their Commander-in-Chief
> responsibilities to their Vice President \-- not without being dead or
> completely incapacitated.

[Tillerson might be the worst secretary of state contender on Trump\'s
list:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/12/07/tillerson-might-be-the-worst-one-on-trumps-list/?utm_term=.dc430eadc00b)

> Friends and associates said few U.S. citizens are closer to \[Russian
> President Vladimir\] Putin than Mr. Tillerson, who has known Mr. Putin
> since he represented Exxon\'s interests in Russia during the regime of
> Boris Yeltsin.
>
> \"He has had more interactive time with Vladimir Putin than probably

> Hamre, a former deputy defense secretary during the Clinton

> International Studies, a Washington think tank where Mr. Tillerson is
> a board member.
>
> In 2011, Mr. Tillerson struck a deal giving Exxon access to prized
> Arctic resources in Russia as well as allowing Russia\'s state oil
> company, OAO Rosneft, to invest in Exxon concessions all over the
> world. The following year, the Kremlin bestowed the country\'s Order
> of Friendship decoration on Mr. Tillerson. \[\...\]

> In short, the only person who would like this nomination would be \--
