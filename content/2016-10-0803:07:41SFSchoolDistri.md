> An automated call to parents and guardians from the San Francisco
> Unified School District implies that the concern is real, if
> misplaced, and heightened by schoolyard stories and social media posts
> among impressionable students.

> \"What we know is that no actual assaults have been reported in the
> Bay Area,\" says a school social worker on the below voicemail
> recording. \"We encourage you to speak with your child about what they
> are really feeling.\" \[\...\]
>
> As evidenced by the SFUSD robocall, the unflappable adult world is
> leading its progeny by example. You know, by somewhat prematurely
> banning clown costumes this upcoming Halloween in a South Bay school
> district according to ABC7, for instance. TV news is busy launching
> investigations into clown costume sales (up 300 percent) and asking
> the tough questions: What effect is this having on everyday working
> clown performers and businesses, hmmm?)
