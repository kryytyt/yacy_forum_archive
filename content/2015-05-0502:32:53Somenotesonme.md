> rear leg structure is *gone*. and by the time they evolved all that,
> their forelegs had turned into proper fins and they didn\'t have
> hourglass figures, because they built up walls of insulating fat and
> blubber where it was needed most - around the vital organs.

> \[walrus skelly\]

> which brings us to the walrus. as you can see the skeletal structure
> and the external appearance are fairly ursiform - the rear legs are
> basically still in there forming the tail, and the pelvis is intact,
> and above that it may as well still be a land animal. if mermaids did
> exist, as hominids who went back out to sea, and if they hadn\'t
> evolved into basically dolphins,

> then a walrus skeletal system, complete with vestigial thigh bones
> inside a kind of muscle skirt, and with significant fat and blubber
> deposits *on the main body* would be most likely. which is to say,
> mermaids with human torsos and seagoing lower bodies would waddle
> around on their tails, have clearly defined thigh structures, and
> would be a hell of a lot rounder above and about the waist than
> they\'re usually depicted.
>
> which begs the question, then, if you see a mermaid and it\'s a skinny
> little thing with a slinky waist and an eel-like tail and a perfect
> bosom and a coy smile, *why does it look like that*? because whatever
> that is? it is not a land animal that readapted to the sea. it is not
> your distant kin. it is a sea creature that adapted *to get your
> attention*.
>
> maybe it\'s all an illusion, a frilly mane, an hourglass shape, and
> narrow antennae that mimic the shape of human arms, waving lonely
> sailors into the water, only to realize too late the bioluminescent
> patterns of lipstick and pert breasts are to distract from what lies
> behind them - viselike jaws and row after row of stiletto teeth.
>
> or maybe it\'s all soft tissue, the gelatinous bell of a jellyfish
> folded into a pleasing shape, luring the unwary down to be caught up
> in a tail that is nothing more than thousands of barbed lines of
> stinging neurotoxin cells.
>
> or it could be that the tail goes deep into a shadowy well, and the
> beautiful woman is a mask for a single enormous jaw, the internal
> skeleton just the endless spine and ribs of a vast and hungry sea
> snake.
>
> or, perhaps most terrifyingly, the face is real but not the face of
> the eyes looking out of it - a human mask for an intelligence both
> cold and calculating, wearing an inviting smile to bring you within
> reach of the dagger behind it\'s back. waiting to slice the skin off
> of you because it needs a new disguise, because it is shaped like you
> but does not look like you, because it must pass as you so it can go
> among you, so that by starlight it may go on land and into town, where
> your kin are sleeping, unsuspecting.
