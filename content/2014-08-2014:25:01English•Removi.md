is being done. Data about a page is to be deleted. But the page is
actually not available not because it was updated, but because the
server is down, or broken, or being blocked (censored) by mistake or
otherwise temporarily. It is likely to go up soon, or the block
(censorship) is going to be lifted.\

[Proposal:]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
A list of strings to detect such cases, and ways of detection (for
example, delete only after the URL has been accessed at least 3 times
with an interval of at least 3 days, but at most 30 days in sum).\

[Problem with the proposal:]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
1. It can be used to increase DoS spam.\
[Partial solution:]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
1. Only use for cached pages?\

[Another potential problem:]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
