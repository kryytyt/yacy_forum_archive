==============================================

me what the *actual* limits for twit video are?

[This says](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/media/uploading-media):

-   Duration should be between 0.5 seconds and 140 seconds (async only)
-   Dimensions should be between 32x32 and 1280x1024
-   Aspect ratio should be between 1:3 and 3:1

[This says](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20172128):

-   Maximum video length is 2 minutes and 20 seconds
-   Maximum file size is 512MB
-   Maximum resolution: 1920 x 1200 (and 1200 x 1900)
-   Aspect ratios: 1:2.39 - 2.39:1 range (inclusive)

[This
says](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/post/media/upload-init):

-   Video size \<= 15 MB

Three pages, and not a single number in agreement among them! Slow clap,
guys. Slow clap.

Since a typical one minute 720p video is going to be around 30 MB, a two
minute 15 MB limit forces you to do a pretty stupid juggling act, so I
hope those aren\'t the real numbers.

Empirically, I\'m getting this:

-   13 sec, 3 MB video: works.
-   60 sec, 28 MB video: upload fails with \"Large file can not be
    finalized synchronously.\"
-   60 sec, 6 MB video: upload succeeds, but then *posting* fails with
    \"Duration too long, maximum:30000, actual:60301\"

So maybe they haven\'t actually rolled out the higher-than-30-second
limit yet? Whatever that limit actually is?
