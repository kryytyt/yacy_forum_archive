right, we could divide the topic into the 2 sections/question\

fyi: for (1)\
That what cam to my mind too and I\'m experimenting with it, with focus
on the button and effect(but are far from happy with what I\'ve tested
so far [(its 2 button up/down, a pie chart and 3
numbers)]{style="font-style: italic"} but stumpled over other things to
look at in the rwi ranking area).\
In regards to how to represent (internal structure), I started with the
rwi (reverse word index) and deal here just with result pairs for
ranking parameter (as that is what machine learning could optimize).\
Have to read your nice reply likely a couple times more and probably
have to get closer to the \... how to represent details (to fully
understand your query, URL, DAG comment/idea but I think will get it
\... as with my above sentence \.... I\'m in the context of a search
which includes query & url).\
But spitting out rows of numbers etc. without answer to your question
(2) which includes \.... \"is handled within YaCy by\...\... or with
Tool xyz\" is not of benefit for me.
