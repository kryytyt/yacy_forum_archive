> Bill Gates has joined Donald Trump in condemning Apple for refusing to
> backdoor its products at the behest of the FBI, promising that the
> company that he founded, a waning firm called Microsoft, would happily
> compromise its security on demand for the US government.
>
> Though Microsoft\'s Bitlocker full-disk encryption was considered very
> secure at its launch, questions have since been raised about its
> integrity. The company was an early participant in the NSA\'s Prism
> program.
>
> Update: Gates has issued a non-denial nonpology insisting that he
> stands behind his words, but he\'s still a good guy, so cut him some
> slack.
