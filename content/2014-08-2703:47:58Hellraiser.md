Hellraiser
==========

Date: 2014-08-27 03:47:58

![](http://www.jwz.org/images/3007279563_37d3c47789_z.jpg)I just watched
all nine *Hellraiser* movies. No, I didn\'t know there were nine of them
either.

The decision-making process went something like this:

\"There is some unfinished business in my *Lament* [screen
saver](http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/). I really ought to add the last
few moves to that.\"\
\"\...Hmm, I guess I need to watch the movie again to make sure I got it
right.\"\
\"\...Hmm, I wonder if any of the later movies added new cube
behaviors?\"

1.  **[Hellraiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser)**

    Wow, is this movie dated! It\'s so 80s, with its giant shoulder pads
    and nuclear family and unfamiliarity with guys in gimp suits with
    lots of piercings. I remember this being a lot gorier and more
    shocking than it seems now. Some of the practical effects hold up
    reasonably well, but it\'s really not that great a movie.

    The cube goes through the four basic moves, plus there\'s an
    impossible shape during the scuffle at the end. It looks like they
    broke two of the models and just glued them together randomly.

2.  **[Hellbound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser_2)**

    At the time, I remember thinking this wasn\'t as good as the first
    one, but now I think it\'s a lot better. The Channard and Tiffany
    characters are pretty interesting, and the whole Leviathan situation
    is pretty cool. There\'s really a lot more running and screaming
    than there needed to be.

    Two new cube behaviors: the opening door, and the transformation
    into Leviathan. The Leviathan transformation annoys me because some
    of the pieces of the cube just fade away in a jump cut, and it
    doesn\'t even remotely conserve mass. But they are in a hell
    dimension at the time, so\... ok. Also, they changed the orientation
    of the faces. I assume that was an accident.

3.  **[Hell On
    Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser_III:_Hell_on_Earth)**

    This movie is absolutely terrible. They even made the \"evil owner
    of an evil nightclub\" boring. (*The Crow* did that trope much
    better.) They turned the Cenobites into low-rent late-period Freddy
    Krugers. This one dimensional character is a cameraman, let\'s stick
    a camera in his head. This guy\'s a DJ, he can shoot CDs out of his
    mouth. Oh, and since we have a female lead, don\'t skimp on the
    daddy issues! Ugh. This is definitely the second worst of the entire
    series.

    One new cube behavior: a tower pops up and zap, zap, zaps Cenobites.
    Also, instead of having six distinct faces, the cube only has three
    faces that are duplicated. Come on, guys, can nobody keep track of
    the original props?

4.  **[Bloodline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser:_Bloodline)**

    Overall, this movie is awful, but it has some good scenes. I really
    enjoyed the fifteen minutes or so about Lemarchand creating the box,
    and the Angelique character is kind of interesting, as a Cenobite
    who predates the gimp-suit fashion trend taking over the hell
    dimensions. The rest of it is crap: the 90s plot is crap, the
    *Hellraiser In Space* plot is crap. I liked the idea of the office
    building that was itself a Lament Configuration, though they didn\'t
    do much with that. Directed by Alan Smithee: probably his finest
    work since *Dune*.

    One new cube behavior: instead of the door opening as a square, it
    opens as a pointy octagon. Nothing special.

5.  **[Inferno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser:_Inferno)**

    This movie is not bad. But it\'s only barely a Hellraiser movie.
    It\'s a noir-ish story about a dirty detective chasing a serial
    killer who (dum dum dum) *might be himself*. The extremely small
    amount of Hellraiser fu in it leads me to believe that the first
    draft of this script wasn\'t a Hellraiser movie at all, before they
    re-tooled it.

    No new box behaviors, since the box barely appears.

6.  **[Hellseeker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser:_Hellseeker)**

    Oh, hey, Kirsty\'s back! This one is pretty good. Probably the best
    one so far. Kirsty\'s jerk husband finds the box, hallucinates
    wildly, and maybe murders a bunch of his friends. Nice twist at the
    end.

    One new box behavior, which might have been a dream: it starts out
    as a sphere, and then turns into a cube. Whatever.

7.  **[Deader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser:_Deader)**

    Deader? They actually called the movie *Deader?* This is another
    script that pretty clearly started out its life as
    not-a-Hellraiser-story, but I think it was pretty good. It\'s kind
    of *Flatliners Go Romania*. How do you run a nightclub in a subway
    car? Note to self, look in to that.

    One new cube behavior: when the chains come out, the whole top of
    the box breaks open. Dumb.

8.  **[Hellworld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser:_Hellworld)**

    This is one of the worst movies I\'ve ever seen. This is some shitty
    student film that they somehow got Lance Henriksen to be in. This
    movie is so bad, I think I liked it better when it was called *House
    of Wax* and starred Paris Hilton. There are a bunch of assholes who
    play an online Hellraiser game and someone invites them to a party
    and kills them all. There\'s a reason but you will never care even
    remotely what it is. Or whether any of them live.

    One new cube behavior: nails come out of it. But it wasn\'t a real
    Lament Configuration so it doesn\'t count.

9.  **[Revelations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser:_Revelations)**

    Despite the reviews, I must say, I enjoyed this one! Maybe I was a
    little punch-drunk by the time I made it this far, though. And
    anything would be a step up from *Hellworld*. It starts off with
    some shaky-cam nonsense, but fortunately they didn\'t keep that up.
    A couple of jerky bro teens go to Mexico, murder a hooker, and pick
    up a Lament Configuration from some dude in a bar, you know, like
    you do. Most of the movie is told as a flashback at a dinner party
    with their jerky family, when one of them escapes from hell and
    shows up skinless on the veranda. Antics ensue.

    The box barely moves at all, but the glowing effects are much
    better. Oh, and the guy who plays Pinhead is the worst. *The worst.*

So! While I was at it, I also made [a supercut of every on-screen
appearance of the box,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHyFLEMDXDQ) in
all nine movies! It\'s 26 minutes long.

As soon as I posted it, it was immediately blocked with five or six
content-ID matches. So I filed a DMCA fair-use counter-claim, and
whattayaknow, it was back up less than a day later. I assumed they just
ignored those\...

**Update:** Oh, I see that it says the counter-claim is still \"being
examined\". So you\'d better [download a copy of
it](http://www.jwz.org/hacks/#youtubedown) in case they change their
mind.
