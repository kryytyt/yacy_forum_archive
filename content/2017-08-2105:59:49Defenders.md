![](https://www.jwz.org/images/tenor-2.gif)As far as I could tell, the
plot of this show was:

Noodle around for 7 episodes doing nothing of consequence, then decide
to *Fight Club* a building into a hole, because there are dinosaur bones
down there, and if you grind them up and put them in your tea like tiger
penis it will make you immortal. Also earthquakes, because reasons?

(If that\'s a spoiler, then I\'m happy I spoiled it for you. I have done
you a service by saving you time.)

I mean, aside from being the most reactionary, conservative example of
[the superhero protagonist
problem](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2012/12/superheroes-and-the-protagonist-problem/)
ever, does no one even consider that immortal dinosaur viagra might be
something that one of the various superscience hospitals owned by Stark
or by The Privileged Iron-Bro might want to get on a god damned slide?

This show was so lousy, even Jessica Jones didn\'t redeem it. I may have
to go re-watch *Don\'t Trust the Bitch in Apartment 23* to get the Bad
Brofist taste out of my mouth.
