Hi luc, I tested your changes and it works perfectly! This is great!
Finally we have a mac release again!\
\
Thank you very much!\
\
There is only one thing which is not working (but I don\'t know if that
worked before): you cannot start the mac release out of the
write-protected dmg drive. YaCy should not write anywhere there, so that
should work, but it does not. Is there any way to make that working as
well?
