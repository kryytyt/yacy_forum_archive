> It\'s called Skunk, a type of \"malodorant,\" or in plainer language,
> a foul-smelling liquid. Technically nontoxic but incredibly
> disgusting, it has been described as a cross between \"dead animal and
> human excrement.\" Untreated, the smell lingers for weeks.
>
> The Israeli Defense Forces developed Skunk in 2008 as a crowd-control
> weapon for use against Palestinians. Now Mistral, a company out of
> Bethesda, Md., says they are providing it to police departments in the
> United States. \[\...\]
>
> The Israelis first used it in 2008 to disperse Palestinians protesting
> in the West Bank. A BBC video shows its first use in action, sprayed
> by a hose, a system that has come to be known as the \"crap cannon.\"
>
> Mistral reps say Skunk, once deployed, can be \"neutralized\" with a
> special soap \-- and only with that soap. In another BBC video, an IDF
> spokesman describes how any attempt to wash it via regular means only
> exacerbates its effects. Six weeks after IDF forces used it against
> Palestinians at a security barrier, it still lingered in the air.
