Hi, I continue experimenting with this idea. htroot and defaults folders
not being regular classpath resources really doesn\'t help\... But I
managed to start a peer without errors based on such a all-in-one
runnable jar! Still have to solve some Jetty related issues, but I am
confident.\
I finally used Maven Shade plugin which is better to package an single
runnable jar. It is really helpful for example to merge name conflicting
SPI services contained in lucene jars.\
For the future, I also believe it would really be a good idea to move
htroot and defaults to a regular classpath folder such as
src/main/resources/net/yacy thus following maven default archetype\...
