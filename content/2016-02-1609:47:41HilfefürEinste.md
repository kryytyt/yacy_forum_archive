Yes thank you very much sixcooler for this advice! It works quite fine,
and I think it will be very useful for every day searches!\
\
Personally to have a true host name search behavior I had to apply quite
extreme settings :\
- host\_s and host\_organization\_s boosted with value : 50.0\
- only kept fields title, author and description\_txt\
\
I believe such a common use case should have a pre-configured profile as
it is done for \"Date profile\".\
\
At least wiki page
<http://www.yacy-websearch.net/wiki/index.php/En:Ranking> could be more
detailed for this case.
