YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Extend Image preview formats support
=================================================================

Date: 2015-10-06 21:10:54

Hi everyone, currently, file formats support is quite limited in YaCy
Images search results preview.\
As far as I know, on current github version only major formats are
correctly displayed : png, jpeg, bmp, ico plus gif and svg unscaled (if
anyone is interested I started a test file to check it :
<https://github.com/luccioman/yacy_search_server/tree/master/test/viewImageTest>).\
Don\'t you think it would be interesting to have some more image formats
rendered in thumb preview, such as JPeg2000 or Tiff as they are not so
uncommon?\
\
As Java SE JDK doesn\'t support theses formats, additional libraries
such as <https://github.com/haraldk/TwelveMonkeys> could be used.\
A small refactoring would be necessary on ViewImage.java :
javax.imageio.ImageIO.read(URL) would be used instead of
java.awt.Toolkit .createImage(URL). This way using JDK SPI system of
ImageIO, future new image formats could be easily added with no more
refactoring needed on ViewImage.\
\
Do you think it is a good idea? I am ready to implement and test this
but if anyone is already on this subject I let this to you.\
\
Another point of view could be to stop rendering image previews with
YaCy ViewImage class and rely solely on browser rendering with its
eventual plugins\... Maybe a configuration option could let user switch
between the 2 rendering systems? Maybe someone have other suggestions?
