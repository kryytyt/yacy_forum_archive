[Bitcoin is tot](https://www.mtgox.com/press_release_20140210.html).
Nein, nicht nur MtGox. Das ganze System. Guckt mal, was sie fÃ¼r ein
Problem gefunden haben:

> A bug in the bitcoin software makes it possible for someone to use the
> Bitcoin network to alter transaction details to make it seem like a
> sending of bitcoins to a bitcoin wallet did not occur when in fact it
> did occur. Since the transaction appears as if it has not proceeded
> correctly, the bitcoins may be resent. MtGox is working with the
> Bitcoin core development team and others to mitigate this issue.

Das ist der Supergau.
