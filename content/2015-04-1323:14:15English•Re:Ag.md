That sounds like an interesting approach. 2nd-level ICANN-approved
domains are somewhat expensive, which acts as a rate limiter on spamming
the same content across domains. 3rd-level domains on the same 2nd-level
domain, however, are very cheap for the owner of that 2nd-level domain.
Does Google require the 2nd-level domain to be unique?\
\
I suppose another approach would be to use a similarity algorithm of the
content in the Solr fields for the pages. For example, you could
construct a float vector of words/phrases, and collapse groups that have
a very high cosine similarity. This idea totally fails the KISS test
compared to your approach, though.
