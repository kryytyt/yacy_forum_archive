I tell a lie.\
In order to save all URL\'s you need a backup from the API table you
need this to work.\
/Tables\_p.html?table=api&count=all&search=\
Not sure what else is needed for a complete fresh rebuild though.\
I may be able to help you rebuild a new yacy server if you can get the
API info. PM me.\
\
On the http error 500 try clicking back then the link again.\
\
How many crawls per hour are you loading the yacy peer up with?\
\
How often do you crawl each one?\
\
From what you said before, over 700 items you crawl in the list, pushed
to the max that\'s like 4000+ crawls/hour on a single CPU. Correct me if
I am wrong.\
\
The VPS provider I use has a Backup service they will keep 2 backups on
there system and it runs once a day.
