Prevent yacy main thread from hanging on browser opening process.

First fix for mantis 689 (http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=689).

On Debian Linux, with a headless jre and no open browser,
browser.openBrowserClassic() was called and waited forever the browser
process end (p.waitFor()). YaCy shutdown was therefore not working until
the browser was closed.

Also modified browser opening command for Unix platform to open the
default the browser (with xdg-open util) instead of Firefox.

xdg-open also has the advantage to be asynchronous (not blocking).
