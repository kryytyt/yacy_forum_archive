I\'ll do that, thanks a lot for your help.\
Unfortunately, I\'ve run out of disk space, among other reasons, because
of Yacy (I believe it produces a growing local index, or DHT, or both,
or something else that I\'m not aware of, right? thus contributing to
running out of disk space).\
As soon as I finish a disk clean up procedure - which hopefully will
take only a couple of days - I\'ll follow your advice, upgrade Yacy and
try to see what happens.\
And let you know.\
See you soon, please don\'t close this topic yet.
