> If a civilization wants to maximize computation it appears rational to
> aestivate until the far future in order to exploit the low temperature
> en- vironment: this can produce a 10^30^ multiplier of achievable
> computation. We hence suggest the \"aestivation hypothesis\": the
> reason we are not observing manifestations of alien civilizations is
> that they are currently (mostly) inactive, patiently waiting for
> future cosmic eras. This paper analyzes the assumptions going into the
> hypothesis and how physical law and observational evidence constrain
> the motivations of aliens compatible with the hypothesis. \[\...\]

> As the universe cools down, one Joule of energy is worth
> proportionally more. This can be a substantial (10^30^) gain. Hence a
> civilization desiring to maximize the amount of computation will want
> to use its energy endowment as late as possible: using it now means
> far less total computation can be done. Hence an early civilization,
> after expanding to gain access to enough raw materials, will settle
> down and wait until it becomes rational to use the resources. We are
> not observing any aliens since the initial expansion phase is brief
> and intermittent and the aestivating civilization and its
> infrastructure is also largely passive and compact. \[\...\]

> since otherwise there will be extra dissipation. Hence there is a good
> reason to perform operations slowly. Fortunately, time is an abundant
> resource in the far future. In addition, a civilization whose
> subjective time is proportional to the computation rate will not
> internally experience the slowdown.
