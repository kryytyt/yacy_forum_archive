Like I [said before](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/10/yes-on-f/), When a
multinational corporation spends \$8M to defeat a ballot measure in a
single city, it\'s a foregone conclusion that you should vote *for* it.
There is *literally no chance* that doing what they want is in your best
interest, unless you are on their board.

And let\'s not forget that the \$12M to which they are referring is an
assessment for several *years* worth of taxes that they skipped paying
in the first place, and *includes fines*. [\"Officials had estimated
that Airbnb owed the city as much as \$25
million.\"](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/M-R-Airbnb-pays-tens-of-millions-in-back-6087802.php)

So they dodged half their tax bill and are now being gloating pricks
about having finally paid half of what they owed. Well played, AirBnB.
Well played.
