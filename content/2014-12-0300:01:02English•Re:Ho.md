I have seen a lot HTTP-Connections of this Type:

Code: 
:   `GET / HTTP/1.1Host: [IPv6-Address]:8090Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8Accept-Language: de,en;q=0.5Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateReferer: http://yacy.info/Connection: keep-aliveHTTP/1.1 403 proxy use not allowed (see Advanced Settings -> HTTP Networking -> Transparent Proxy; switched off).Date: Tue, 02 Dec 2014 22:22:16 GMTCache-Control: must-revalidate,no-cache,no-storeContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1Content-Length: 375Server: Jetty(9.2.3.v20140905)<html><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1"/><title>Error 403 </title></head><body><h2>HTTP ERROR: 403</h2><p>Problem accessing /. Reason:<pre>    proxy use not allowed (see Advanced Settings -&gt; HTTP Networking -&gt; Transparent Proxy; switched off).</pre></p><hr /><i><small>Powered by Jetty://</small></i></body></html>`

to some different YaCy-Peers. The 403-Error does not depend on Browser,
it does depend on the Host-Parameter in the HTTP-Request (Line 2 in the
Quote).\
\
I have Wireshark-Traces about HTTP-Connections to your Peer, some with
403-Error and some with 200-Success,
[all]{style="text-decoration: underline"} of this with a \"GET /
HTTP/1.1\" HTTP-Command. The only Difference is the Host-Parameter in
the HTTP-Requests, some Host-Names/IP-Addresses are always accepted,
some Host-Names/IP-Addresses are sometimes accepted and sometimes
rejected (depend on the actual YaCy-Internal View of its environment)
and some Host-Names are always rejected. On IP-Level: all Connections go
to the same IPv6-Addresse (the one with \":??FF:FE??:\")!\
\
Even my yacyDNS-Tool get sometimes an 403-Error and it use always the
simple GET-Variant and always the correct Host-Name for the accessed
YaCy-Peer.\
