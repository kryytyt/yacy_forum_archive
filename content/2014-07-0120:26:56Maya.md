Dear Lazyweb, do you have suggestions for a good set of Maya tutorials?
Or a book?

Textual tutorials vastly preferred over video ones, since videos seem to
always take forever to get to the mumbled point.

The googs are *full* of Maya tutorials \-- yes, I can goog too \-- but
all the ones I\'ve found are crap.

I\'ve gotten pretty good at Sketchup, but it is terrible at many things
(importing or exporting things that are usable by other programs;
creating printable, water-tight models; etc., etc.) so I\'m trying to
graduate to what the big kids use.

Unsurprisingly, it has a learning curve like a plumb line.
