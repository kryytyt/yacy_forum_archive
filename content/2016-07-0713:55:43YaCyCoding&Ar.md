Hi, personally I also agree with the idea of using common and well known
and documented libraries. On the other hand I think YaCy templating
system is quite raw but do the job, and its entry-barrier is quite low.\
Anyways, your plan sounds feasible. I only hope the generic JSON
producing servlet will not add to much processing overhead.
