Mariner II carried two experiments designed to measure the
charged-particle radiation in space, including galactic cosmic rays and
streams of high-energy particles which are released intermittently from
the sun. Virtually continuous measurements of the particle fluxes in
space were made by the instruments throughout the 109-day journey to
Venus and during the passage near the planet on December 14, and
additional data have been received for approximately 10 hours per day
since that time.
