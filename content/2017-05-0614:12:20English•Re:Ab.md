Yes YaCy need testing and feedback, and here you provide some which is a
good thing.\
\
Given the current size of the project, personally I prefer to spend the
little time I have to improve the existing code base rather than
restarting from scratch with a completely different technology
stack\...\
\
By the way, if in the coming weeks I could find and publish some
improvements to the points you mention you will find my report here\...
