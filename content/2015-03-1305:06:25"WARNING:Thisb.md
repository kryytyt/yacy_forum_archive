architecture: keeping poverty unseen and deflecting our

> Defensive architecture is revealing on a number of levels, because it
> is not the product of accident or thoughtlessness, but a thought
> process. It is a sort of unkindness that is considered, designed,
> approved, funded and made real with the explicit motive to exclude and
> harass. It reveals how corporate hygiene has overridden human
> considerations, especially in retail districts. It is a symptom of the
> clash of private and public, of necessity and property.
>
> Pavement sprinklers have been installed by buildings as diverse as the
> famous Strand book store in New York, a fashion chain in Hamburg and
> government offices in Guangzhou. They spray the homeless
> intermittently, soaking them and their possessions. The assertion is
> clear: the public thoroughfare in front of a building, belongs to the
> building\'s occupant, even when it is not being used. \[\...\]
>
> Defensive architecture acts as the airplane curtain that separates
> economy from business and business from first class, protecting those
> further forward from the envious eyes of those behind. It keeps
> poverty unseen and sanitises our shopping centres, concealing any
> guilt for over-consuming. It speaks volumes about our collective
> attitude to poverty in general and homelessness in particular. It is
> the aggregated, concrete, spiked expression of a lack of generosity of
> spirit.
>
> Ironically, it doesn\'t even achieve its basic goal of making us feel
> safer. There is no way of locking others out that doesn\'t also lock
> us in. The narrower the arrow-slit, the larger outside dangers appear.
> Making our urban environment hostile breeds hardness and isolation. It
> makes life a little uglier for all of us.

Lots of good stuff at the [Dismal
Garden](http://www.dismalgarden.com/archives/defensive_architecture)
gallery (I think this is what used to be the [\"Anti-Sit
archives\"](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2005/08/spikes-spikes-for-everybody/)
\-- many of the photos look similar, anyway.)

And, one of my favorite background gags from *Transmetropolitan,* 1999.
It took me a little while to dig these out. Can you believe that these
images aren\'t googleable?
