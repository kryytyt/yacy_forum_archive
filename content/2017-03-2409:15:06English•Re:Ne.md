Hi do you still encounter this problem?\
If so I suggest you to have a look at your logs (yacy\*.log files in
DATA/LOG) and to search for lines containing \"seed-list URL\" : there
should at least be some lines like \"\...YACY BOOTSTRAP: N seeds from
seed-list URL <http://somePeer..>.\
Looking for log lines containing \"yacyClient.hello\" or
\"hello/client\" could also be instructive.
