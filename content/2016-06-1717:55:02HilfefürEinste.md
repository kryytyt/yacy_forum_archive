Hilfe für Einsteiger und Anwender • Re: Port 8090 auf Debian vServer (angeblich?) nicht offen
=============================================================================================

Hi luc\
\
Thanks for answering.\
Yes I\'ve tried to run yacy with default iptabels rules.\
Straight after installing yacy (debian package via apt-get install) my
yacy peer was shown as \"Senior\" peer and port 8090 would be open.\
Then a few hours later, the admin page showed port 8090 is not open.
Between new install and login a few hours I didn\'t touched the iptable
config at all.\
There was no reason to do that.\
\
Because the admin page is showing \"port 8090 is not open\" I\'ve
applied the iptable config as per my origin post without any luck.\
Since the install the admin never showed \"port 8090\" is open again.\
\
Please note I\'ve noticed the same behavior on a second vSever which
runs on ubuntu.
