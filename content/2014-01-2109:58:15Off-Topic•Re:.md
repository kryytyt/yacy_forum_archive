No.\

If I would follow your argumentation every german could legally run a
piracy website which is hosted on a russian server.\
This is forbidden and you would be judged for this just like you would
run this on a german server.\
A good first startpoint for this discussion for german users is\

\
And: also if you are no german and do not live in germany as long as you
addresses german users you have to act compatible to german laws.\
If not you can be judged too. Depends on the contracts between your
state and germany and if you ever want to travel to germany to see the
reaction.\
If you are a russian and run a piracy website on an australien website
it could be that you get in jail here.\
\
So because also YaCy is decentralized why not the forum too?\
