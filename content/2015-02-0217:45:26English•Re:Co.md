HI and Thank you for your reply!\
\
In fact, all our servers are already using the ALLIP labels.\
Yet, they are a collection of physically separate Robinson servers that
read each other but do not write to each other.\
\
They also do not have a separate network name.\
We used the name presented in the generic setup.\
All the servers are identical.\
We assume this a security risk that needs to be corrected.\
We cannot find a sample file + instructions for creating a new network
name using existing data sets across multiple and existing - stand-alone
- Robinson servers.\
\
We need to find instructions please how to change this \'early\'
environment to full p2p with DHT, please.\
Many thanks
