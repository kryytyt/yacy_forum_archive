YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ github bin releases
================================================

Date: 2016-11-03 00:01:58

How about if we make the github YaCy releases complete (startable /
runnable) releases.\
The only real part missing is just the lib/yacycore.jar (and of course
htroot \*.class)\
\
Has anyone tried already if it is a hassle to add files to the right
location in a github release ?\
\
By design, github seems to allow/promote complete (bin) releases\
\
see <https://help.github.com/categories/releases/>\
with the note on that page:\

> <div>
>
> \
> We don\'t limit the total size of your binary release files, nor the
> bandwidth used to deliver them. However, each individual file must be
> under 2 GB in size.\
>
> </div>

I like it, as it comes in W. friendly zip format along with tar.gz (and
could be a additional update target)
