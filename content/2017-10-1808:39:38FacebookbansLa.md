look! Facebook banned another of my friends! It must be a day ending in
\"y\".

Of course, Limor has no idea why this happened. Because commenting on
specific accounts, even to the owners of those accounts, is \"against
policy\".

[If you work for Facebook,
quit:](https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/10/17/facebook-bans-adafruit-s-ladyada-facebook-finkd/)

> There are more Russian bots or whatever they are on Facebook than USA
> female EEs & CEOs from MIT on Facebook that have USA manufacturing

Zuckerberg, [~~2010~~
2004](http://www.businessinsider.com/well-these-new-zuckerberg-ims-wont-help-facebooks-privacy-problems-2010-5):

> Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard\
> Zuck: Just ask\
> Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS\
> \[Bro McBro\]: What? How\'d you manage that one?\
> Zuck: People just submitted it.\
> Zuck: I don\'t know why.\
> Zuck: They \"trust me\"\
> Zuck: Dumb fucks\

It of course goes without saying that, having banned someone with
connections and influence, there may shortly be a fauxpology saying that
\"upon review\", whatever triggered this ban did not actually violate
their terms of service. (Implied: \"this time\"). Maybe they will even,
in passive voice, throw an anonymous sweatshop contractor under the bus
and abstractly \"regret\" any \"inconvenience\".

People without such influence don\'t get even that level of royal
treatment.

This is your irregularly-scheduled reminder:

> If you work for Facebook, quit.
>
> It is morally indefensible for you to use your skills to make that
> company more powerful. By working there, you are making the world an
> objectively worse place. I\'m sure you can find a job working for a
> company that you don\'t have to *apologize* for all the time.
>
> You can *do it.* I *believe* in you.
