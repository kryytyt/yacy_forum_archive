change compute id algorithm
    the previous version add coordinates hashcodes to id, which maybe negative and doesn't guarantee unicity.
    first, the coordinates must be converted to double, then, multiplied by 1000 and converted to integer value. This method makes sure coordinates are distinguishable to a precision of 3 digits after comma
