ok thank you for pointing that out, I will think about this.\
\
nevertheless, if anyone is reading this and is still interested in the
answer to the question - I figured out how to get more results.\
\
There is a parameter called \"startRecord\". At first you set it to 0.
If you got 20 results you set it to 20, got another 20 \--\> set it to
40 and so on.
