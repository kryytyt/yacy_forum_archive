[Think of the implications for lowrider
technology:](http://makezine.com/2014/07/31/art-and-science-come-together-to-reinvent-the-wheel-robot-wheel/)

> A set of actuators can expand the wheel to its full diameter for
> traversing large objects and difficult terrain and retract them to a
> smaller diameter for moving under objects and small spaces. A series
> of sensors outside the wheels detect the terrain and then adjust the
> wheel diameter accordingly making the design both agile and strong. So
> much so that it\'s designed to move quickly while carrying a payload.
> If the robot is carrying too much weight, it will deflate the wheels
> until it can produce enough torque to move efficiently.
