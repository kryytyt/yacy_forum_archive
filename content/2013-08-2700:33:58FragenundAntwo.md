I assume you are talking about yacy-forum.org. In my opinion, this forum
should be deactivated, respectively frozen, because it\'s way easier, if
we discuss all together in the same place.\

I know what you mean. The most big search engine will find
[René]{style="font-style: italic"} even if you write
[Rene]{style="font-style: italic"}. But on the other hand,
[forum]{style="font-style: italic"} and
[forums]{style="font-style: italic"} are simply two different words, and
[e]{style="font-style: italic"} and [é]{style="font-style: italic"} are
two different letters, if you understand what I want to say. It always
good, if you know exactly what you are looking for, and then enter it
correctly in the search box.\

As far as I know, there are no such parameters, but I might be wrong.
Maybe you want to file a suggestion in the wishlist at
