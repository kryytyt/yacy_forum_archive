English â€¢ Yacy server performance monitoring
============================================

Date: 2014-05-06 01:59:08

In an old, headless AMD Athlon 64 PC, 2GB ram, 160 GB HD, I installed
Ubuntu Server 14.04, Cacti 0.8.8b and Yacy 1.7 for GNU/Linux.\
\
I would like to share some graphs produced by Cacti showing the overall
server performance for a two-hour time span (from 18:00 to 20:00)
running Yacy on senior mode, 1 crawl.\

\
Some notes:\
\
1) In the CPU Usage graph, the green area corresponds to nice usage\
\
2) In the Load Average graph, the three colors represent, from yellow to
red, 1, 5 and 15 minute load average.\
\
2) From 12:00 to 17:00, the server was only running Cacti\
\
3) The smaller peaks at 17:00 represent my first attempt at running
Yacy, where I had a small issue regarding administrative access, after
which I stopped it until 18:00, when I solved the issue.
