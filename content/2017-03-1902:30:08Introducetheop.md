Introduce the option to configure a shutdown port.
A port value of -1 will disable this option.

If set to a value greater 0, YaCy listens on this of on the local loopback 
address (127.0.0.1) for a shutdown or restart signal.
E.g. connect to http://localhost:8005/shutdown will stop the YaCy server.
http://localhost:8005/restart will restart it.
This option allows to stop YaCy locally independant from the web web 
frontend (which might be configured for password protected remote access).
