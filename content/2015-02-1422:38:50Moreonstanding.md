Standing Up At Desk, Leaving Office, Never Coming

> In an effort to help working individuals improve their fitness and
> well-being, experts at the Mayo Clinic issued a new set of health
> guidelines Thursday recommending that Americans stand up at their
> desk, leave their office, and never return. \"Many Americans spend a
> minimum of eight hours per day sitting in an office, but we observed
> significant physical and mental health benefits in subjects after just
> one instance of standing up, walking out the door, and never coming
> back to their place of work again,\" said researcher Claudine Sparks,
> who explained that those who implemented the practice in their lives
> reported an improvement in mood and reduced stress that lasted for the
> remainder of the day, and which appeared to persist even into
> subsequent weeks. \"We encourage Americans to experiment with
> stretching their legs by strolling across their office and leaving all
> their responsibilities behind forever just one time to see how much
> better they feel. People tend to become more productive, motivated,
> and happy almost immediately. We found that you can also really get
> the blood flowing by pairing this activity with hurling your staff ID
> across the parking lot.\" Sparks added that Americans could maximize
> positive effects by using their lunch break to walk until nothing
> looks familiar anymore and your old life is a distant memory.
