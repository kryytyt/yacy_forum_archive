Hilfe für Einsteiger und Anwender • Where to post basic start questions in English?
===================================================================================

Date: 2014-01-21 22:59:00

I\'m trying to find:\
1) Where I am supposed to post.\
2) Where to see / find English interface (I see Forum rules, but do not
understand).\
3) Am trying to start with basic index of file on my internal network,
but it isn\'t \"crawling\"\...\
(I am using URL\'s like <file://D:/> \-- where all my Documents are).
But see nothing being scanned\...\
\
Have selected intranet search, but it doesn\'t descend into the
directory \-- only telling me filenames at the top level.\
\
Looks like a neat project, but seems to have high learning curve\... ;-(
