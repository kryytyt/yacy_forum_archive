> If they had a time machine, men would be more likely than women to
> travel to pre-World War II Europe and kill Hitler, according to a
> recently published study. \[\...\]
>
> Participants were asked 20 questions about moral dilemmas such as
> decisions about murder, torture, lying, abortion and conducting
> research on animals.
>
> The study examined two philosophical principles that relate to ethics,
> deontology and utilitarianism. According to the former, the morality
> of an action depends on its consistency with a moral norm.
> Utilitarianism, meanwhile, holds the morality of an action maximizes
> utility \-- in other words, that it is best for the greatest number of
> people.
