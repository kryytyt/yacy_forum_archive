> and \"challengeable.\" But, he said, \"I\'d be careful about using the
> word \'lie.\' \'Lie\' implies much more than just saying something
> that\'s false. It implies a deliberate intent to mislead.\"

> He said reporters should state the facts, but leave classifying them
> to readers, citing the example of Trump\'s claim that thousands of
> Muslims in New Jersey were celebrating on 9/11 (which is false).

> The New York Times editorial board has used \"lie\" to describe
> Trump\'s rampant abuse of facts. And Washington Post conservative
> columnist Jennifer Rubin has taken the media to task for not using the
> word. Other outlets ― including MSNBC, New York Magazine and HuffPost
> ― will use the word when it\'s merited.

> But Baker said that in doing so, \"you run the risk that you look like
> you are, you\'re not being, objective.\"
