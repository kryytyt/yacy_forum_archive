I found time to do this .. its now implemented. The check for processes
due in the API action table runs now once every minute. However, this
does not include a higher precision in process periods, which is
currently still with a minimum of 10 minutes to prevent that this tool
is misused for DoS purpose. As far as I see in your idea this is not
important because you want to use the event trigger? If yes, then there
is missing a feature to set exact minutes in the event trigger, the
trigger currently can only execute at full hours.
