Some aeons-old secrets of Mars could be unveiled by spectrometers,
television cameras and radiometers aboard Mariner VI and VII in the next
week or so when the space- craft fly by the red planet at a distance of
only 2,000 miles. Scientists will use the cameras and other experiments
to seek hopeful signs of nonlunar developmental processes, including a
Martian atmosphere conducive to some form of life.
