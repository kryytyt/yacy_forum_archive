New high-resolution images from NASA\'s Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft comparing the ice caps at the North and South poles show the difference between the two regions is in the \'cheese\'. The North polar cap has a relatively flat, pitted surface that resembles cottage cheese, while the South polar cap has larger pits, trough and flat mesas that give it a holey, Swiss cheese appearance.
