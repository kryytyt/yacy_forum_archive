Hi q5sys!\
\
I want to try the benchmarks with your Linux-Version and with the same
SD- and USB-Hardware on RasPi. Since my development hosts are all
Windows systems, I tried to unpack your file with 7z. But it seems to be
defect. Maybe you can send any other image next days. At first I would
only test the read/write-performance.\
\
In order to send me big image files please, use my FTP-directory:\
- Server: ftp.hzdr.de\
- Directory: /pub/incoming/Herbrand\
\
After upload please, send me a short mail to herbrand € gmx .dot de
