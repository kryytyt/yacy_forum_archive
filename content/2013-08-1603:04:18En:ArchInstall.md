If you are using a full-featured AUR helper like
\[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/packer/ packer\],
\[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yaourt/ yaourt\], or another of
that ilk, you can run \<~~code~~\>packer -S yacy\</~~code~~\> or
\<~~code~~\>yaourt -S yacy\</~~code~~\>. Adjust for your specific
helper.

First, ensure that you have installed all the dependencies;
specifically, you need \<code\>sudo\</code\>, \<code\>libcups\</code\>,
\<code\>xorg-server\</code\>, and \<code\>java-environment\</code\>.
Install these with pacman. Once this is finished, download and extract
the PKGBUILD from the AUR. You can do this from your web browser
(\[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yacy/ link\]) and extract it using
your favorite GUI tool, or you can run the following command:

Now \<code\>cd\</code\> into the folder that the tarball extracted to
(most likely called \"yacy\") and run \<~~code~~\>makepkg\</~~code~~\>.
(Note: if you forgot to install the dependecies before, you should run
\<code\>makepkg -s\</code\>.) This will build us a nice .tar.xz package
which \<code\>pacman\</code\> knows how to handle. Once
\<code\>makepkg\</code\> completes, install the package with
\<code\>pacman\</code\>:
