YaCy Coding & Architecture • Re: A generic API advanced crawler

well that looks like a lot of work. The big issue with this is: YaCy is
already a big beast, and an api with user accounts would open new
questions.\
My current attempt to create an architecture which can grow - and maybe
has such a kind of an api - is a microservice partition of the whole
search engine parts.\
My thoughts are here: <http://kaskelix.de/>\
This would also cover the idea to have a separate crawler.
