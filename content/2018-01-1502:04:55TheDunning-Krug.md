am at something of a loss for snark
here](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/style/bitcoin-millionaires.html).
I want to believe that this is fiction, like some early 90s *Mondo 2000*
cover story documenting some made-up movement with a photo of some
creepy-assed Cap\'n Crunch lookalike in fun-fur. But I suspect it\'s
not.

There\'s just too much to quote here, so I\'ve bolded my favorites.

> There\'s an actual house called the Crypto Castle, and the king is
> Jeremy Gardner, 25, a rakish young investor with a hedge fund who has
> become the de facto tour guide for crypto newcomers.
>
> \"I do I.C.O.s. It\'s my thing,\" he said. He wore a pink button-front
> and pink pants. **\"It\'s me, a couple V.C.s and a lot of
> charlatans.\"**
>
> About eight people live in the Crypto Castle on any given night, and
> some of Mr. Gardner\'s tenants brought out snacks (Cheez-Its and a jar
> of Nutella). One of the bedrooms has a stripper pole. Mr. Gardner
> leaned back into the sofa and rested his feet on the table. **He
> recently did an I.C.O. for a start-up after-party.** \"You can I.C.O.
> anything,\" he said. He runs Distributed, a 180-page magazine about
> cryptocurrency that comes out about once a year. He is now raising
> \$75 million for his hedge fund, Ausum Ventures (pronounced
> \"awesome\"). He said his closest friends are **moving to Puerto Rico
> to get around paying taxes.**
>
> \"They\'re going to build a modern-day Atlantis out there,\" he said.
> \"But for me, it\'s too early in my career to check out.\" \[\...\]
>
> **\"My neurons are fried from all the volatility,\"** Mr. Hummer said.
> \"I don\'t even care at this point. I\'m numb to it. I\'ll lose a
> million dollars in a day and I\'m like, O.K.\"
>
> His room is simple: a bed, a futon, a TV on a mostly empty media
> console, three keyboard cleaning sprays and a half dozen canisters of
> Lysol wipes. His T-shirt read, \'The Lizard of Wall Street,\' with a
> picture of a lizard in a suit, dollar-sign necklaces around its neck.
> He carries with him a coin that reads, \"memento mori,\" to remind
> himself he can die any day. **He sees the boom as part of a global
> apocalypse.**
>
> \"The worse regular civilization does and the less you trust, the
> better crypto does,\" Mr. Hummer said. \"It\'s almost like the
> ultimate short trade.\"
>
> Mr. Hummer went out to meet Joe Buttram, 27, for drinks. As a mixed
> martial arts fighter, Mr. Buttram said he would fight for a couple
> hundred bucks, sometimes a few thousand, and worked security at a
> start-up, but **his main hobbies were reading 4chan and buying vintage
> pornography, passions that exposed him to cryptocurrency.** \[\...\]
>
> They talk about buying Lamborghinis, the single acceptable way to
> spend money in the Ethereum cryptocurrency community. The currency\'s
> founder frequently appears in ((fan art as Jesus with a Lamborghini.
> **Mr. Buttram says he\'s renting an orange Lambo for the weekend.**
> And he wears a solid gold Bitcoin \"B\" necklace encrusted with
> diamonds that he had made. \[\...\]
>
> \"When I meet people in the normal world now, I get bored,\" Mr.
> Hummer said. \"It\'s just a different level of consciousness.\"
>
> The tone turns somber. \"Sometimes I think about what would happen to
> the future if a bomb went off at one of our meetings,\" Mr. Buttram
> said. Mr. Hummer said, **\"A bomb would set back civilization for
> years.\"** \[\...\]
>
> As the holiday party filled up, a cryptocurrency rapper called
> CoinDaddy \-- Arya Bahmanyar, 28 \-- was getting ready to perform.
> Formerly a commercial real estate agent, Mr. Bahmanyar works full time
> at CoinDaddy after becoming a self-described crypto-millionaire (\"you
> think I would dress up like this if I wasn\'t?\"). **\"Right now all
> our entertainers come from outside crypto culture** \-- not inside
> crypto, and we\'ve got to change that,\" he said.
>
> He pointed to his outfit \-- a long white fake mink coat, gold-heeled
> shoes \-- and said, \"It\'s gold, right? It\'s gold. It\'s a niche,
> and I\'m going to fill it.\"

(So that you don\'t have to, I clicked on some of his YouTube clips. Not
even funny enough to share.)
