That paragraph right there nails it. I find the rest of the article to
be kind of rambling, partly because I hated *Stranger Things*, but, that
right there.

(I hated *Stranger Things* because it is composed almost entirely of
things that I despise: 1: Steven Spielberg movies; 2: Stephen King
movies; 3: Nostalgia.)

A lot of my friends are freaking out about the season premiere of *The
Walking Dead*, and I feel their emotions are misdirected: rather than
feeling sad for the fate of characters they liked, they should feel
angry at the crass manipulativeness of the writers.

The \"who died?\" cliffhanger at the end of the last season was
forgivable. It\'s just a cliffhanger. Those are a staple of season-based
television. It\'s a cheap technique, and time-honored, while not in any
way honorable.

But the real manipulation came in the followup episode, where, for
almost the entire episode, the only people in the dark about what just
happened were *the audience.*

If you are a writing a story and you hide from the audience facts that
are well known to all of the characters in the story, you are a hack.

If you are a writer and your viewpoint character is an omniscient
narrator, but you made that narrator be *more ignorant* than literally
every character actually participating in the plot, what the fuck is
that? That\'s hack writing, that\'s what the fuck that is. It\'s cheap,
it\'s cheating, you are bad at your job and you should feel bad.

Let me be clear: my anger about how bad that writing was is not based on
my love of the show. I don\'t have any emotional investment in *The
Walking Dead*. I watch it, but I think it\'s mediocre. It\'s not bad,
but I just don\'t care that much about any of the characters.

Though like I keep saying, *Fear The Walking Dead* seems to exist solely
to remind us of how much worse *The Walking Dead* could be: a good
metric for when you should stop watching a show is if you can\'t think
of a single character where that character\'s death would leave you with
any emotional impact besides, \"Yay, I don\'t have to hear their whining
any more, or be angry at their reflexive secrecy, at their *stultifying*
incuriosity, or at their stupid decisions that seemed to exist solely to
create bullshit plot problems for the writers to solve.\"

Some people have accused *Mr. Robot* of plotblocking, but I don\'t think
that\'s really true. *Mr. Robot* is a show that is explicitly *about* an
unreliable narrator. Most of the reveals we get happen when Elliot
learns about them, or when Elliot\'s various mental compartments allows
him to know them. Most of the time, he\'s our viewpoint character and
his confusion and ignorance is ours. Or he\'s directly and explicitly
lying to us in the second person.
