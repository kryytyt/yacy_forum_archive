> It was the second case involving mannequin heads used to conceal meth
> shipment to Hawaii.

> \"We were never able to directly link them,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney

> His public defender, Alexander Silvert, said outside of court his
> client doesn\'t know why mannequin heads were used. \"He had nothing
> to do with the shipping,\" Silvert said.
