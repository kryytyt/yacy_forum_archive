I don´t get it\....\
\
I have sixcooler´s content in a file called small.html. I run yacy on a
server and the file is in /root/uploads/small.html Owner is yacy, Group
is deamon. (i also tried root:root). Persmissions are 774. The file is
shown in the graphics on Crawler\_p, \"Running Crawls (1) and i can
\"Terminate\" the crawl. BUT YaCy is simply not crawling. Nothing, no
index change, no error\... simply nothing. YaCy version 1.81/9091\
\
[Some status infos like: File readable, file not found \... would be
great!]{style="font-weight: bold"} For now i can enter whatever to the
\"From File (enter a path within your local file system)\" field. No
complains at all - same behavior as described above\...
