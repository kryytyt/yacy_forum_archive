English â€¢ Re: YaCy as ZeroNet search engine
===========================================

First, intranet mode :\
- go to Administration \> \"Use case & account\" menu
(/ConfigBasic.html) : then choose \"Intranet Indexing\", and click \"Set
Configuration\" button.\
\
Then you can try at least by three ways :\
- Choose \"URL Viewer\" in \"Search Interfaces\" (/ViewFile.html) : you
can paste here your ZeroNet site local url, and click \"Show Metadata\"
button. You will be able to see how YaCy parses this page, switching
between different view modes with \"View as\" combobox.\
- go to Administration \> \"Load Web pages, Crawler\" menu
(/CrawlStartSite.html) : you can paste your ZeroNet url and \"Start New
Crawl\". You will see \"Crawled Pages\" results at the bottom of
Crawler\_p.html screen.\
- go to Administration \> \"Advanced Crawler\" menu
(/CrawlStartExpert.html) : you can also paste you url here and \"Start
New Crawl Job\". You will also see \"Crawled Pages results at the
bottom.\
\
I just tried all these but, beyond the problem of hidden network access
through a proxy, the main issue is that all ZeroNet sites content is
dynamically filled in an iframe with javaScript. So as far as I know
YaCy does not include a JavaScript engine rendering when crawling, and
all he parses and indexes is just the header of ZeroNet.\
I guess this can be a more general issue as many websites provide
dynamic content through Javascript. Is there some option or solution
with existing YaCy crawler?\
\
About access to hidden networks and share of indexed data, I suppose it
would not be a problem when the network is not accessed with a local
proxy, but only rely on an alternate name resolution system such as
Namecoin. Does anyone already crawls .bit sites?
