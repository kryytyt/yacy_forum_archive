plate scans from the

> In response to a public records request, we obtained the entire LPR
> dataset of the Oakland Police Department (OPD), including more than
> 4.6 million reads of over 1.1 million unique plates between December
> 23, 2010 and May 31, 2014. The dataset is likely the largest ever
> publicly released in the United States \-- perhaps in the world.
>
> After analyzing this data with a custom-built visualization tool, Ars
> can definitively demonstrate the data\'s revelatory potential. Anyone
> in possession of enough data can often \-- but not always \-- make
> educated guesses about a target\'s home or workplace, particularly
> when someone\'s movements are consistent (as with a regular commute).
>
> For instance, during a meeting with an Oakland city council member,
> Ars was able to accurately guess the block where the council member
> lives after less than a minute of research using his license plate
> data. Similarly, while \"working\" at an Oakland bar mere blocks from
> Oakland police headquarters, we ran a plate from a car parked in the
> bar\'s driveway through our tool. The plate had been read 48 times
> over two years in two small clusters: one near the bar and a much
> larger cluster 24 blocks north in a residential area \-- likely the
> driver\'s home.

[All Muni Buses Now Have Transit Lane Enforcement
Cameras](http://sf.streetsblog.org/2015/03/24/all-muni-buses-now-have-transit-lane-enforcement-cameras/)

> Muni has installed front-facing cameras on every Muni bus to ticket
> drivers who double-park in transit-only lanes.
>
> Muni is the first major American transit agency to have enforcement
> cameras on every bus.
>
> Muni didn\'t publicize the milestone, but we checked up on the effort
> with SFMTA spokesperson Paul Rose, who said it was completed last fall
> (a few months off the target date of spring 2014). Equipping the whole
> fleet marks a major milestone in the effort to make Muni service more
> effective, and it nicely complements the city\'s growing number of
> red-painted transit lanes.
>
> So be warned, drivers: If a Muni bus weaves around your parked car in
> a transit lane, you will get a ticket in the mail. The base fine is
> \$110.
>
> Unfortunately, state law prohibits the cameras from being used to cite
> moving violations, so drivers cruising down a Muni lane can still only
> be penalized by the SFPD.
