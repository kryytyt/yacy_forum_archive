Flyer screens
=============

So we got that [Android box](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KF061MQ/)
running one of our [flyer
screens](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/10/flyer-screens/) reasonably
well, and ordered four more, and guess what? They all have *exactly the
same MAC address*. No, that doesn\'t make our network lose its mind at
all, why do you ask?

Seriously, *who does that?*

00:e0:11:22:33:44, if you were wondering. What a clever number.

Apparently you can only change this by jailbreaking them, which was an
icepick we weren\'t exactly looking forward to trying on for size.
Hooray.
