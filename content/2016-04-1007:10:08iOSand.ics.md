iOS and .ics

Dear Lazyweb,

Is clicking on a link to document of type `text/calendar` believed to
work on iOS? Using https:, not webcal:, that is, \"event attachment\",
not \"dynamic calendar subscription\".

If so, do you have an example of one that works?

Because [mine appear not
to](https://www.codeword-sf.com/calendar/export.cgi?id=20160420h&type=ics).
Mostly Safari just does nothing, but sometimes it pops up a dialog
saying \"Download Failed, Safari cannot download this file.\"

Related question: if Safari was logging an error to syslog on my phone,
how would I see it? If it\'s in \"Xcode / Window / Devices / Device /
View Device Logs\", I don\'t see it. That seems to only be crash logs,
not general syslog verbosity.
