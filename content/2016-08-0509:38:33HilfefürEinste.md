Ah yes thanks sixcooler! Again YaCy had an already available feature,
one just has to know where to find it

Effectively these options provide finer tuning inside YaCy. I am playing
a little with them and it looks like they do the job on Debian Linux.
But on my machine they do not prevent high CPU peak usages\... Not
really a problem, but when you wish to have a hard CPU usage limit, OS
specific features like cgroups on Linux may be more reliable. Of course
the best is to test what fits the most one\'s needs.
