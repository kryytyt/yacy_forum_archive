> The website billed itself as a place where older men with money could

> financially.

> \"Find your sugar baby,\" the site exhorted its users.
>
> This year, Paul Aronson, an 84-year-old from Manhattan, contacted a
> 17-year-old girl, Shaina Foster, through the site and took her out to
> dinner. On a second date, Ms. Foster brought along her twin sister,
> Shalaine.
>
> For a few hours on Oct. 1, the evening looked as if it might turn into
> an old man\'s fantasy. The three dined at an expensive restaurant in
> Midtown. Then Mr. Aronson invited the teenagers to have a drink with
> him at the four-story brick townhouse he owns on East 38th Street.
>
> He bought a bottle of raspberry-flavored rum from a liquor store on
> the way, a defense lawyer said. But instead of receiving caresses or
> whispered flirtations, Mr. Aronson ended up tied to a coffee table for
> 20 hours.
>
> Prosecutors say the two girls bound him with zip ties, took \$470 in
> cash from his wallet and went on a spending spree with his credit
> cards, buying makeup and clothes, while he lay helpless on his living
> room floor.
>
> On Wednesday, the Foster sisters, looking more like high school
> students than hardened criminals, pleaded not guilty in State Supreme
> Court in Manhattan to charges of kidnapping, burglary, larceny and
> related crimes. Justice Michael J. Obus ordered them returned to jail
> without bail. Both face a minimum of 15 years in prison if convicted
> of the top charge. \[\...\]
>
> According to court documents, Shaina Foster told a detective she did
> not understand why Mr. Aronson had reported the crime. \"He asked to
> do things I wasn\'t going to do. He is ugly, old and disgusting. I
> tied him up. I took his money and left. He was starting to creep me
> out.\"
