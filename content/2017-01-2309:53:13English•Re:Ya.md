English â€¢ Re: Yacy Update to 1.92 Problem (Debian)
==================================================

For anyone that could be interested, the analysis of log files provided
by bubul revealed that its local index was effectively requested, but
was too slow to answer within the /yacysearch.html [hard-coded
timeout](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/Release_1.92/htroot/yacysearchitem.java#L126){.postlink}
(requesting directly through the /solr/select api returns results, but
it takes more than one minute).\
\
The best advice I could give him was to switch to an external Solr
Server rather than the default embedded one, given the quite huge size
of its local index.\
\
But maybe someone more experienced with large Solr indexes would have
some better advice to share here\...
