Nein! Wer haette das gedacht?! Cryptocat ist Sondermuell:

JavaScript-Webdev-Spacken. Die koennen nicht mal eine richtige
Programmiersprache.

> Cryptocat is run by people that don\'t know crypto, make stupid
> mistakes, and not enough eyes are looking at their code to find the
> bugs. Cryptographers know the minimums or at least know you should
> look them up. Cryptocat tried BPKDF2, RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and ECC and
> managed to mess them all up because they used iterations or key sizes
> less than the minimums. There was a bug in the generation of ECC
> private keys that went unchecked for 347 days. They seem to not
> understand simple programming concepts such as a byte vs a decimal
> digit character
