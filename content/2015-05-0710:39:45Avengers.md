![](http://www.jwz.org/images/iron_turducken.gif)*Avengers 2* is exactly
like a large bucket of concession-stand popcorn: it seems great at the
time and you just keep shoveling it down because wow, popcorn is
delicious, and then you get to the bottom of the bucket and you\'re
thinking, \"Oh god, why did I eat that whole thing, what the hell is
that artificial butter flavoring made of, anyway?\" and then you
remember it\'s misogyny.
