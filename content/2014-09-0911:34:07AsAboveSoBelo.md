The new *Tomb Raider* movie, [*As Above So
Below*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83PpryYHHeY), is actually pretty
good! I was skeptical, since I find \"shaky-cam\" to be a pretty worn
out technique at this point, but the cam is not super-shaky, and there
are multiple cams so it doesn\'t go all FPS.

As is traditional in every action or horror movie with a female
protagonist, they felt the need to front-load it with lots of Daddy
Issues, which was irritating \-- what if every Dwayne Johnson or Bruce
Willis movie started with a flashback scene of *Mommy didn\'t really
love me!*, as if to say \"muscle-bound action man can\'t have any
personal agency unless he\'s still sucking his thumb over his
childhood\" \-- that would get pretty tired pretty fast, right? Just
fucking stop it. Please.

Anyway, despite that rocky start, it had some solid scares, some
absolutely terrifying claustrophobia rivaling [*The
Descent*](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2006/09/recent-movies-6/), and the
ending was weird and didn\'t wrap everything up into a neat little bow.
I liked it.
