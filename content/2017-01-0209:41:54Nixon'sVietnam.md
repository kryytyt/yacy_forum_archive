> A newfound cache of notes left by H. R. Haldeman, his closest aide,
> shows that Nixon directed his campaign\'s efforts to scuttle the
> \[Vietnam\] peace talks, which he feared could give his opponent, Vice
> President Hubert H. Humphrey, an edge in the 1968 election. On Oct.
> 22, 1968, he ordered Haldeman to \"monkey wrench\" the initiative.

> The 37th president has been enjoying a bit of a revival recently, as
> his achievements in foreign policy and the landmark domestic
> legislation he signed into law draw favorable comparisons to the
> presidents (and president-elect) that followed. \[\...\] Haldeman\'s
> notes return us to the dark side. Amid the reappraisals, we must now
> weigh apparently criminal behavior that, given the human lives at
> stake and the decade of carnage that followed in Southeast Asia, may
> be more reprehensible than anything Nixon did in Watergate. \[\...\]
>
> In a conversation with the Republican senator Everett Dirksen, the
> minority leader, Johnson lashed out at Nixon. \"I\'m reading their
> hand, Everett,\" Johnson told his old friend. \"This is treason.\"
>
> \"I know,\" Dirksen said mournfully.
>
> Johnson\'s closest aides urged him to unmask Nixon\'s actions. But on
> a Nov. 4 conference call, they concluded that they could not go public
> because, among other factors, they lacked the \"absolute proof,\" as
> Defense Secretary Clark Clifford put it, of Nixon\'s direct
> involvement.

> Nixon was elected president the next day.

[Maybe now\'s a good time to re-read Hunter S. Thompson obituary of this

> If the right people had been in charge of Nixon\'s funeral, his casket

> empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a
> man and a jabbering dupe of a president. \[\...\] Let there be no
> mistake in the history books about that. Richard Nixon was an evil man
> \-- evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality
> of the Devil can understand it. He was utterly without ethics or
> morals or any bedrock sense of decency. Nobody trusted him \-- except
> maybe the Stalinist Chinese, and honest historians will remember him
> mainly as a rat who kept scrambling to get back on the ship. \[\...\]

> Some people will say that words like *scum* and *rotten* are wrong for
> Objective Journalism \-- which is true, but they miss the point. It
> was the built-in blind spots of the Objective rules and dogma that
> allowed Nixon to slither into the White House in the first place. He
> looked so good on paper that you could almost vote for him sight
> unseen. He seemed so all-American, so much like Horatio Alger, that he
> was able to slip through the cracks of Objective Journalism. You had
> to get Subjective to see Nixon clearly, and the shock of recognition
> was often painful. \[\...\]

> to be a victim of his ugly, Nazi spirit.
>
> He has poisoned our water forever. Nixon will be remembered as a
> classic case of a smart man shitting in his own nest. But he also shit
> in our nests, and that was the crime that history will burn on his
> memory like a brand. By disgracing and degrading the Presidency of the
> United States, by fleeing the White House like a diseased cur, Richard
> Nixon broke the heart of the American Dream.
