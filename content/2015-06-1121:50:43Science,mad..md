> Since retiring from the U.S. Army in 2000, Dr. John Henry Hagmann has
> helped train thousands of soldiers and medical personnel in how to
> treat battlefield wounds. His company, Deployment Medicine
> International, has received more than \$10.5 million in business from
> the federal government.
>
> The taxpayer-funded training has long troubled animal rights
> activists, who contend that Hagmann\'s use of live, wounded pigs to
> simulate combat injuries is unnecessarily cruel. But an investigation
> by Virginia medical authorities alleges that pigs weren\'t the
> doctor\'s only training subjects.
>
> During instructional sessions in 2012 and 2013 for military personnel,
> Hagmann gave trainees drugs and liquor, and directed them to perform
> macabre medical procedures on one another, according to a report
> issued by the Virginia Board of Medicine, the state agency that
> oversees the conduct of doctors.
>
> Hagmann, 59, is accused of inappropriately providing at least 10
> students with the hypnotic drug ketamine. The report alleges Hagmann
> told students to insert catheters into the genitals of other trainees
> and that two intoxicated student were subjected to penile nerve block
> procedures. Hagmann also is accused of conducting \"shock labs,\" a
> process in which he withdrew blood from the students, monitored them
> for shock, and then transfused the blood back into their systems.
