is this headline for real?

[Why American Farmers Are Hacking Their Tractors With Ukrainian
Firmware](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware)

> To avoid the draconian locks that John Deere puts on the tractors they
> buy, farmers throughout America\'s heartland have started hacking
> their equipment with firmware that\'s cracked in Eastern Europe and
> traded on invite-only, paid online forums. \[\...\]
>
> A license agreement John Deere required farmers to sign in October
> forbids nearly all repair and modification to farming equipment, and
> prevents farmers from suing for \"crop loss, lost profits, loss of
> goodwill, loss of use of equipment \... arising from the performance
> or non-performance of any aspect of the software.\" The agreement
> applies to anyone who turns the key or otherwise uses a John Deere
> tractor with embedded software. It means that only John Deere
> dealerships and \"authorized\" repair shops can work on newer
> tractors. \[\...\]

And a reminder to never trust a man with a pig farm:

> Deere sold farmers their tractors, but has used software to maintain
> control of every aspect of its use after the sale. Kluthe, for
> example, uses pig manure to power his tractor, which requires engine
> modifications that would likely violate John Deere\'s terms of service
> on newer machines.

> \"I take the hog waste and run it through an anaerobic digester and
> I\'ve learned to compress the methane,\" he said. \"I run an 80
> percent methane in my Chevy Diesel Pickup and I run 90 percent methane
> in my tractor. And they both purr. I take a lot of pride in working on
> my equipment.\"
