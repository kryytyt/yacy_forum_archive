In only approximate order of favoriteness \-- and for the *twelfth year
in a row (!!)* \-- here is my year-end wrap-up. As usual, a few of the
entries on the following list were released earlier than 2014, but that
is when I discovered them, so I\'m allowing some slack. Though most were
actually released in 2014.

This year I acquired around 62% as much new music as [last
year](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/12/2013-music-wrap-up-and-mixtape-136/):
roughly 75 new releases, almost all released within the last 3 years,
more than half released in 2014.

That is really a surprising drop! I wonder how much of that can be
pinned on [how poorly curated SXSW was in
2014.](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/03/sxsw-rip/) In previous years, I
discovered a lot of great music through the [SXSW
torrents](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/03/bigger-sxsw-2014-torrent/), as
well as through happenstance at the festival itself, but this year, not
so much.

I should find some better festivals to travel to. Corollary: I should
learn to hate traveling less.

Number of those bands that I saw perform this year: 23.\
Number of those bands that performed at DNA Lounge this year: 8.\
Go Team.

I haven\'t commented on all of these because I still find it *really
hard*, and anyway, if you want to know what they sound like, that\'s
what the corresponding mixtape is for, right? Scroll down.

I like these things. You should like them too. Here\'s your shopping
list:

-   **[K.Flay](http://www.kflay.com/) - \"Life As A Dog\"**

    It\'s a bit mellower and sadder than her previous releases, with
    more singing and less rapping, but still some of the finest music
    you\'re going to find for feeling bad about yourself and your
    terrible relationships!

-   **[The Casket Girls](https://www.facebook.com/casketgirls) - \"True
    Love Kills the Fairytale\"**

    They\'ve got kind of a faux-60s-girl-band thing going on, like if
    Bananarama were clinically depressed.

-   **[The Asteroids Galaxy
    Tour](http://www.theasteroidsgalaxytour.com/) - \"Bring Us
    Together\"**

    A good album, though I was a little disappointed that this year\'s
    live show replaced the horn section with a keyboardist. I imagine
    that\'s a lot of mouths to feed, though.

-   **[EMA](http://www.thefuturesvoid.net) - \"The Future\'s Void\"**

    I think this might be indie gospel about the Surveillance State. Or
    something. The [acompanying 90s-style cyber-zine that goes along
    with it](http://newhive.com/ema/back-to-the-void?q=@ema) is kind of
    amazing.

-   **[iamamiwhoami](http://towhomitmayconcern.cc/) - \"Blue\"**

    It sounds a lot like the previous one, but it\'s still very good,
    and I remain impressed at their devotion to the craft of music video
    and just generally being weird as hell.

-   **[Gazelle Twin](http://www.gazelletwin.com) - \"Unflesh\"**

    Hey, remember when I used to listen to industrial music? I guess
    this is the closest thing to that on this list (and it\'s not really
    very close.) This was probably my favorite show we\'ve had [at DNA
    Lounge](http://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2014/11-07d.html) this
    year. Even though their live act was two people and a stack of
    electronics, the freakiness of her faceless urban cenobite
    performance made it fantastic.

-   **[Meg Myers](http://www.megmyers.com/) - \"Make a Shadow\"**

    More angry music for feeling bad about your stupid obsessions! Often
    the function of pop music is to let you know that there are people
    out there with worse ideas.

-   **[Cathedrals](https://www.facebook.com/WeAreCathedrals) -
    \"Cathedrals\"**
-   **[Fujiya & Miyagi](http://www.fujiya-miyagi.co.uk/) - \"Artificial
    Sweeteners\"**

    This sounds exactly like Fujiya & Miyagi, but that\'s what I was
    hoping for.

-   **[The Faint](http://www.thefaint.com/) - \"Doom Abuse\"**

    This sounds exactly like The Faint, but that\'s what I was hoping
    for.

-   **[Brody Dalle](http://www.brodydalle.com/) - \"Diploid Love\"**
-   **[Le Butcherettes](http://www.lebutcherettes.net/) - \"Cry Is for
    the Flies\"**

    Please don\'t kill me.

-   **[Heartsrevolution](http://www.heartsrevolution.com/) - \"Ride or
    Die\"**

    I think they summed themselves up best with their between-song
    banter: *\"I\'ll be driving my icecream truck around NYC and an
    Indian cab driver will lean over and say \'this song is awesome\'
    and I\'ll be all \'I know, right?\'\"* She\'s not kidding about the
    ice cream truck, is the thing. And there\'s a vajazzled guitar.

-   **[La Femme](https://www.facebook.com/lafemmeressort) - \"Psycho
    Tropical Berlin\"**

    This is the third album on this year\'s list that prominently
    features a retro electric organ sound. I find this odd. We had them
    at DNA in [in
    April](http://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2014/04-11d.html), and it
    was a great show. Much more raucous and sweaty than you might
    expect.

-   **[Ume](http://www.umemusic.com/) - \"Monuments\"**
-   **[Giana Factory](http://www.gianafactory.dk/) - \"Lemon Moon\"**
-   **[Rich Girls](https://www.facebook.com/richgirlsarehere) -
    \"Fiver\"**
-   **[Warpaint](http://www.warpaintwarpaint.com/) - \"Warpaint\"**

    \"Third album is self-titled\" is still a thing, huh? It\'s hard to
    hear them without imagining them singing in super slow motion in
    front of a fan.

-   **[Ringo Deathstarr](http://www.ringodeathstarr.com/) - \"God\'s
    Dream\"**

    One of these days I\'m going to stop thinking that the line \"these
    shoes aren\'t going to gaze themselves\" is hilarious, but today is
    not that day. We had them in
    [October](http://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2014/10-08d.html).

-   **[The Dollyrots](http://www.dollyrots.com/) - \"Barefoot and
    Pregnant\"**

    \"Our friends are always texting us to tell us that they saw one of
    our videos playing in DNA Pizza\" is the most unexpected thing
    someone in a band has said to me in some time. We had them here in
    [May](http://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2014/05-16d.html).

-   **[Client](https://www.facebook.com/clientmusic) - \"Authority\"**

    Depeche Mode cast a long shadow.

-   **[Dead Sara](http://www.deadsara.com/) - \"Dead Sara\"**

    They have a bit more of a straightforward \"LA hard rock\" sound
    than I usually go for, but their [live show here in
    November](http://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2014/11-21d.html) was
    pretty great.

-   **[Phantogram](http://www.phantogram.com/) - \"Voices\"**
-   **[Keep Shelly In
    Athens](https://www.facebook.com/keepshellyinathens) - \"At Home\"**
-   **[Sinah](https://www.facebook.com/sinahofficial) - \"Sleek\"**
-   **[Little Daylight](http://www.littledaylight.com/) - \"Tunnel
    Vision\"**
-   **[The Mast](http://www.themastmusic.com/) - \"Pleasure Island\"**
-   **[Minipop](https://www.facebook.com/minipopsf) - \"Chances\"**
