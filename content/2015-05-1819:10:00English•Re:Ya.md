My 2¢ in case you won\'t receive any acknowledgeable answer.\
\

-   the number of crawler threads: have you increased the amount of
    crawler threads? Hypothesis: perhaps these threads might actually be
    separate processes.
-   start script: do you start yacy via any custom script? Hypothesis:
    perhaps you are starting multiple instances.
