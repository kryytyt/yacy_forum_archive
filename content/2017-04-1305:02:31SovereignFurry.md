> The thing that got me wasn\'t the \"furry\" aspect, but the Sovereign

> Alright, so, every lawyer in the world that clicked on that probably

> capitalization of certain letters, and the words \"potentially
> damaging criminal activities causing substantial commercial injury

> Alright, so SovCit is legal jargon for \"sovereign citizens,\" a

> Second, those seven points are probably complete bullshit. \"Incite to

> Is that \"riot\" or \"hunting\" at that point? Is it okay if they have

> But here\'s the real takeaway:

> 3\. Furry Sovereign Citizens do not insist that their fursonas are their

> 5\. This shit is better when you know the guy writing it has, at some

totally a thing because of course they
are.](http://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2017/02/furred-reich-truth-about-nazi-furries-and-alt-right)

Though whether they are \"ha ha only trolling\" Nazis or Actual Fucking
Nazis is unclear (both of which are equally
[punchable](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2017/01/there-is-nothing-more-american-than-punching-nazis/),BTW.)
