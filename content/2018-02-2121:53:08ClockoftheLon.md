> After over a decade of design and fabrication, we have begun
> installing the first parts of the Clock of the Long Now on site in
> West Texas. In this video you can see the first elements to be
> assembled underground, the drive weight, winder and main gearing. This
> is the first of many stages to be installed, and we continue to
> fabricate parts for the rest of the Clock in several shops along the
> west coast.
