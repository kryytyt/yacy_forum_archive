Pro-Users â€¢ Re: A Peer To Peer Web Directory To Go With YACY
============================================================

Date: 2013-07-19 19:09:31

Hi! Your project seems to be pretty interesting, although I have to say,
that I\'m not really a fan of \"freemium services\", where paying users
have an advantage over the other users. Especially in web directories
and search engines, the ranking should only be influenced by factors
like quality, popularity etc. However, that\'s just my opinion.
Nonetheless, I wish you good luck for your project, and if you need help
or assistance using yacy, feel free to ask.
