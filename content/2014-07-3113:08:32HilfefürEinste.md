Here\'s what I\'d be sending on an hourly basis (please, see attachment
below): a couple of html pages and graph images.\
\
If you start with index.html, you will see four thumbnail graphs.\
\
If you click on each of them, you will be redirected to other html page
where you will see details for each graph.\
\
If you don\'t want to use this html structure, only the graph images,
you just have to determine which image you want and then pick it from
the graphs subdirectory.\
\
Please note that the graphs transmission cycle doesn\'t reflect on the
graphs granularity: even if I choose to send the graphs once a day, they
will stil get the 1 minute granularity (I set Cacti poller to run every
minute)\
\
So, the only thing I need is an ftp account where to send the graphs.
Any suggestion on this will be appreciated.\
