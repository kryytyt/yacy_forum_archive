== Auto-Search-Suggestions ==\
This servlet can return a set of search term completions for a given
search prefix. The search completions can be used by a search client to
dynamically present the end user with search term suggestions. The
suggestion interface is an implementation of the
\[http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Suggestions/1.0
Opensearch Suggestion Extension\].\
\
=== Operations performed when the servlet is called ===\
The serlet is called with a set of words. The servlet then tries to find
useful suggestions based on those words. A google search suggestion is
based on the experience with common search queries but this can not be
the strategy of a search engine, which cannot use such data because of
no or too less users. YaCy tries to complete the searches based on
common occurrences of similar words. To find such words, YaCy creates
first a set of possible wrong-spellings of the given words which is
computed by permutions of missing characters, superflous characters,
twisted characters and missing head oder tail of the word. When such a
set of possible replacements is computed, all of them (possibly some
hundred) are tested against the search index and such words which appear
most in the existing index are selected. These words are then returned
as suggestions.\
\
=== Servlet Address ===\
The servlet can be called on two paths, these paths are
\<code\>/suggest.json\</code\> and \<code\>/suggest.xml\</code\>.\
The full URL is
\<code\>\<nowiki\>http://\<peer-IP\>:\<peer-port\>\<servlet-path\>\</nowiki\>\</code\>.\
The json-variant represents the opensearch description and the xml
variant is similar.\
\
=== Properties in the http header ===\
The caller must obey the \[\[Dev:APIHttpHeader\|http header rules\]\].\
\
=== Properties in the http post-arguments ===\
Calls to the servlet can be made using a GET or POST operation. The
properties are:\
\* \<code\>q=\<query\>\</code\> the query can contain several words,
each of them separated by a \'+\'\
\* \<code\>timeout=\<milliseconds\>\</code\> a timeout for the
computation of the suggestions (optional)\
\* \<code\>count=\<number-of-suggestions\>\</code\> the maximum number
of suggestions to be computed (optional)\
\
=== Result ===\
The returned document contains a result as described in
\[http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Suggestions/1.0
Opensearch Suggestion Extension\]\
\
=== Example Usage ===\
We give two examples, one for a json and one for an XML result\
\
==== Example 1 ====\
http://localhost:8090/suggest.json?q=brelin\
returns\
\[\"brelin\",\[\"berlin\",\"brolin\",\"bredin\",\"belin\",\"brein\",\"breslin\"\]\]\
\
==== Example 2 ====\
http://localhost:8090/suggest.xml?q=hanno\
returns\
\<?xml version=\"1.0\"?\>\
