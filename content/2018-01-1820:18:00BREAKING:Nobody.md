> On Saturday January 13, residents all across Hawaii received a text
> message at 8:07am stating that a ballistic missile was on it\'s way to
> their island and advised they should take shelter immediately.
> \[\...\] We can\'t begin to imagine what would go through someone\'s
> mind after reading that message, but based purely on the traffic
> numbers, it\'s NOT to be watching porn.
>
> Based on real-time, per-minute pageviews, and compared to levels on
> the previous two Saturdays, our statisticians found a precipitous drop
> in traffic at 8:07am immediately after the warning was sent out. By
> 8:23am, traffic was a massive -77% below that of a typical Saturday.
> As residents were notified around 8:45 that the initial warning was
> sent in error, traffic began to return to normal and Hawaiians
> collectively breathed a sigh of relief. Those seeking further relief,
> headed back to Pornhub where pageviews surged +48% above typical
> levels at 9:01am.
