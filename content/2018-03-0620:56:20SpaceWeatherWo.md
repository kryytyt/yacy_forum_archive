[Space Weather Woman](http://www.spaceweatherwoman.com/). Just to tide
you over until the next Carrington Event destroys civilization. She\'s
been [doing these](https://www.youtube.com/user/SpWxfx/videos) every two
weeks for years! Of special interest to fans of the [BBC Shipping
Forecast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxHa5KaMBcM).
