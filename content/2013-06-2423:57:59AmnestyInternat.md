[Amnesty International weist darauf
hin](http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/us-must-not-hunt-down-nsa-whistleblower),
dass es eine Menschenrechtsverletzung ist, dass die USA Snowdens Pass

> his rights to freedom of movement and to seek asylum elsewhere. The

> they have an asylum claim underway in any country.
