I started with yacy on a smaller server but I\'ve reached limits very
soon because I try to collect as many urls as possible (basically I
don\'t set any limits).\
\
I think for a restricted index with a few thousand pages/urls it will be
no problem to run that on any regular machine.\
\
I am running the peer called zerberos which has up to now indexed more
than 42 million pages - there are not so many peers that have so many
pages.\
\
And yes, I have invested a few thousand for the server, just because I
am interested to see what happens when the index grows bigger

Orbiter, if you have any questions about the system or suggestions for
improvement of spidering speed then don\'t hesitate to contact me.\
\
Also I posted a question some time ago - I wonder if a direct access to
the solr server from java would be possible, maybe you know that?\
\
And I would have some more technical questions on what information can
be extracted\....
