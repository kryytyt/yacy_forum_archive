I encountered the same bug; it was fixed for me as of a few months ago.
The YaCy devs have been doing an outstanding job.\

Excellent work, it\'s great that this is being implemented. A friend
asked me a few months ago if it was feasible to install YaCy on a small
VPS; at the time I had to tell him no\... I guess when the next release
is stable he\'ll finally be able to install it and support the YaCy
network.\

\@Orbiter, do you prefer that English-language technical threads be
posted in the English forum or in the \" YaCy Coding & Architektur\"
forum? I posted a technical inquiry here:
[viewtopic.php?f=8&t=5114](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=5114){.postlink-local}
, but have received no reply after 11 days. (I\'m a university student
interested in doing YaCy development for a grad-level course, so I\'m
curious if you have suggestions on how to get quick answers\... I\'m not
expecting instant replies, but 11 days and counting makes my course
project kind of difficult.) Thanks!
