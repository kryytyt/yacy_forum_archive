I\'m not great with Wiki\'s Luc (I\'m so old I started programming while
we were just phasing out punched cards).\

Actually, the debian package pretty much did everything on its own -
it\'s case of\
\
\
\* Make a fresh install of DietPi (dietpi.com) for your SBC. (You\'re
probably going to want a hard drive to.)\
\* Let it update, etc.\
\* Change the swapfile size to something a little larger - perhaps 600Mb
(this is all available via DietPi\'s menus).\
\* Install YaCy from the debian package - that makes sure you get the
right JVM.\
\* Optionally: link the YaCy store to the hard drive. I used a large
(128Gb) MicroSD for my test.\
\* Stick a fork in it, it\'s done!

If you\'re using a Pi or similar, put a BIG cooler on that beast.
There\'s a lovely metal case over at DietPi that will do the trick and
allow the machine to throttle up to 1.2GHz 100% of the time without
getting hot enough to keep your granny\'s feet toasty.
