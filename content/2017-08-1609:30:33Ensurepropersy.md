Ensure proper synchronous robots entry retrieval on first check.

Previously, when checking for the first time the robots.txt policy on a
unknown host (not cached in the robots table), result was always empty
in the /getpageinfo_p.xml api and in the /CrawlCheck_p.html page. Next
calls returned however the correct information.
