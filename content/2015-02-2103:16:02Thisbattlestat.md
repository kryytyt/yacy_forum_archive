> On January 14, during tests of the 110-megawatt Crescent Dunes Solar
> Energy Project near Tonopah, Nevada, biologists observed 130 birds
> entering an area of concentrated solar energy and catching fire.
>
> The test started at 9:00 a.m. on January 14. By 10:30, biologists
> working on the site began noticing what have become known as
> \"streamers,\" trails of smoke and water vapor caused by birds
> entering the field of concentrated solar energy (a.k.a. \"solar
> flux\") and igniting.
>
> \[\...\] at least one of the birds injured was a common raven, which
> \-- in the words of our source \-- \"turned white hot and vaporized
> completely.\" Asked to confirm that report, the BLM\'s Evenson said
> that his office didn\'t have a list of the species affected, but added
> that \"that\'s what streamers *are*.\"
