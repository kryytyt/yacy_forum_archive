> I\'ve always felt like constructing printed math was much more of an
> art form than regular typesetting. Someone typesetting mathematics is
> less a \"typist\" and more an artist attempting to render abstract
> data on a two-dimensional surface. Mathematical symbols are themselves
> a language, but they are fundamentally a visual representation of
> human-conceived knowledge \-- knowledge that would be too inefficient
> to convey through verbal explanations. This brings the typesetting of
> mathematics closer to a form of data visualization than regular
> printed text. \[\...\]
>
> To fully appreciate mathematical typography, we have to first
> appreciate the general history of typography, which is also a history
> of human civilization. No other art form has impacted our lives more
> than type.
