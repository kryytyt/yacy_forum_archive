So basically, entire countries\' worth of porn hounds randomly start
hammering on my server all at once, even though no BitTorrent traffic
has ever passed to or from the network it\'s on, because for some
unknown reason, the now-long-defunct piratebay tracker sometimes
resolves to *my* IP address. Hooray.

This (possibly) mitigates the problem somewhat, by returning an actual
BitTorrent error message to the clients so they stop retrying sooner:

> `<Location ~ "^/announc"> Â  ErrorDocument 404 "d14:failure reason13:not a tracker8:retry in5:nevere"</Location>`{style="font-size:smaller"}

We had previously blackholed the entire Chinese IP space because of
this, but we missed some.

Hi, how\'s your day going?
