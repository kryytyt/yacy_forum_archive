==================================================

Tired\....\
when crawls seemed too slow, I raised memory to 1200 on vps box with 2
GB RAM, Ubuntu 14.04 x86\_64\
on next reboot, it refused to start.\
\
looking at /usr/share/yacy/DATA/SETTINGS\
in yacy.conf - which starts\...\
\# This is an automatically generated file, updated by
serverAbstractSwitch and initialized by defaults/yacy.init\
\
I downloaded, edited the memory down to 750 and uploaded it.\
javastart\_Xmx=Xmx750m\
javastart\_Xms=Xms750m\
\
\
Unfortunately the file got badly damaged.\
How do I regenerate it, please?\
Lots of data inside\...over a million docs\
It is installed on a remote vps, Ubuntu, in daemon\
Many thanks.
