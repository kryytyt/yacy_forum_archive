As I mentioned on GitHub, if we consider it acceptable to run Javascript
in the browser, it\'s feasible to re-sort the results in JS after some
of them have been sent to the browser. (Based on my initial testing of
the branch I pushed, doing this results in much better ranking and IMO
much better UX.) RWI post-ranking could presumably be recalculated as
needed and any changed results pushed to the browser again; I\'m not
sure how badly that would affect CPU usage.
