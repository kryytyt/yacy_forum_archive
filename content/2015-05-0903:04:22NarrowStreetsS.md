[Narrowing a Residential Street:
McAllister:](http://narrowstreetssf.com/mcallister/)

> It\'s a pretty ordinary street in San Francisco. The buildings are
> primarily three-story Victorians divided into flats. Measured from
> building to building, the public right-of-way is 68′ 9″ \-- a common
> width for residential streets in the city.
>
> I want to highlight the total space we\'re setting aside for cars in
> the current setup. When we multiply the width of the lanes (38′ 9″) by
> the length of the block (425′), the result is more than 15,000 square
> feet of space for cars, just on a single block of McAllister Street.
>
> We can now reuse the old center roadway \-- nearly 40′ across \-- in a
> more productive way. Assuming we build to three stories, we now have
> 45,000 square feet of buildable space where people can live, work,
> shop, and relax \-- just on the 1400 block of McAllister.

> The old segregated sidewalks (each 15′) are wide enough to become our

> respond to narrow streets by avoiding them when they can, and by
> moving very slowly \-- no more than about 5 mph \-- when they need to
> use them for local access. In a future post we\'ll look at how to
> supplement narrow streets with a network of arterials and boulevards

> What type of places make a city great? To answer that it\'s helpful to
> think about the difference between \"Places\" and \"Non-Places\".
> Nathan Lewis defines them: Places are areas where things happen.
> \[\...\] Non-Places are areas of the city where nothing happens. This
> includes:
>
> -   Parking lots
> -   Useless greenery (not a park, but landscaping where nobody goes)
> -   Roadways and other transportation infrastructure
> -   Areas around buildings which are not \"destinations,\" and often
>     have no real purpose
>
> When we look at traditional cities outside of North America we can see
> a consistent pattern \-- lots of \"Place\" and very little
> \"Non-Place\".
