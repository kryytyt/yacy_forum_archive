Organa: A Critical
Obituary](https://mobunited.wordpress.com/2016/12/28/leia-organa-a-critical-obituary/)

> Leia Organa, the politician and revolutionary who led the defeat of
> the Galactic Empire, died after a short illness. She was 60 years old.
> Hers was a life laced with controversy concerning everything from her
> tactics to her very ancestry, but her intelligence, commitment to the
> Republican cause, and place at the heart of the Rebellion, and later
> the Resistance against Neo-Imperialism, remains the indisputable core
> of her legacy. \[\...\]
>
> The Organa Doctrine identified the path to victory, but the woman
> herself remained on the front line, rarely pausing for conferences
> with Alliance intelligence droids. This may have contributed to the
> ambiguous reception she received in the post-Imperial era, as she
> didn\'t emerge with the political influence accorded leaders like Mon
> Mothma. While they directed large scale operations (often per
> Organa\'s theories and recommendations) she led covert operations on
> numerous worlds. She worked under deep cover as the bounty hunter
> Boussh, and during Galactic Concordance negotiations at the end of the
> war, admitted that during this period, she personally assassinated
> Hutt leader Jabba Desilijic Tiure. \[\...\]
