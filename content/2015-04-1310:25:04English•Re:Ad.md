English â€¢ Re: Adopt English for forum language
==============================================

I asked the owner of the English forum mentioned by Orbiter
(<http://www.yacy-forum.org>) some time ago if it was OK for him if I
moved the forum to my webspace to have more control (e.g. updates,
plugins) and he agreed. Unfortunately I never found the time to make the
dump (which he provided to me to) work and all I can do at the moment is
to delete spam whenever I see it due to limited resources (mainly time)
on my side.\
\
I think if there was somebody who is willing to take over the English
forum or at least to take good care of it, it could become a nice place
again.
