I have server version of linux of course. PPM is low \<3000\
\
The problem is different:\
When load takes all cores on 100% - crawling and all other actions
stops. Queue is clear\
on logs there is only info I\'ve send before\
\
Whit not working crawling heavy load is not decreasing\
\
It looks like something stuck on parsing and yacy cannot stops on this
and cannot go forward\
\
Maybe webpage visible on logs have something that parser cannot handle
properly?
