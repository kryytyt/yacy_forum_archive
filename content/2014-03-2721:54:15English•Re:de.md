I can reach debian.yacy.net (from Germany) via IPv4 and IPv6.\
\
according to tracepath/traceroute, wae.rzone.de is the last hop on IPv4
route, te4-2.fiddlersriddle.as6724.net is the one before.\
This issue might be related with the fact that yacy.net was down for
some time.\
Does it work for you now?
