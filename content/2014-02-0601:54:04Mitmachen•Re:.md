Mitmachen â€¢ Re: Das leidige Thema SPAM im Forum

An idea I had and started to write a few building blocks for is an Anti
SPAM Robot program for my forum using 2 computers running QuickBASIC
4.5\
I never finished it because there are not very many keyboard shortcuts
when moderation is involved in a forum.\
\
Would it be helpful if the Robot looked in active posts and reported
posts with links of domains that are listed known for spam or other
suspect content?\
\
The system I had in mind has a master computer running XP or 2003 to
gather, sort and identify content, a slave that talks to its keyboard
port receiving its commands over a serial connection from the master
computer.
