[Baby\'s Rare Brain Tumor Had
Teeth:](http://www.livescience.com/43706-brain-tumor-teeth.html?cmpid=514627_20150524_45061036&adbid=10152758437651761&adbpl=fb&adbpr=30478646760)

> After an analysis of tumor tissue, doctors determined the child had a
> craniopharyngioma, a rare brain tumor that can grow to be larger than
> a golf ball, but does not spread.
>
> Researchers had always suspected that these tumors form from the same
> cells involved in making teeth, but until now, doctors had never seen
> actual teeth in these tumors. \[\...\] \"It\'s not every day you see
> teeth in any type of tumor in the brain. In a craniopharyngioma, it\'s
> unheard of,\" Beaty said.
>
> Craniopharyngiomas commonly contain calcium deposits, \"but when we
> pulled out a full tooth\... I think that\'s something slightly
> different,\" Beaty told Live Science.
>
> Teeth have been found in people\'s brains before, but only in tumors
> known as teratomas, which are unique among tumors because they contain
> all three of the tissue types found in an early-stage human embryo,
> Beaty said. In contrast, craniopharyngiomas have only one layer of
> tissue.
