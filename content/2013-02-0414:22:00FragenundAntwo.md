Thanks, Orbiter.\
\
Well, something may be wrong with my settings or something else.\
Today, I scheduled a crawl which, soon after, showed in
/Table\_API\_p.html (not sure if this is the page titled \"Recorded
Actions\"; is it?). It showed today\'s date as Last Exec Date.\
What do you mean by \"call count\" in the /Crawler\_p.html page? There
are many counts there (please, be patient, I\'m a dummy)\
Also, in /CrawlProfileEditor\_p.html there is no entry regarding that
new crawl; actually, there are no new entries for the other scheduled
crawls I had previously scheduled, that should have run in the late few
days.\
Thanks for the prompt reply.
