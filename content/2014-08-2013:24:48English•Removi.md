English â€¢ Removing old index entries when reindexing a page
===========================================================

Date: 2014-08-20 13:24:48

After YaCy indexed a page, can it remove the entries for that page that
had existed before? I am not talking about the manual settings of a
particular crawl, that delete everything about a page without caring if
it is being indexed.\
\
When YaCy does \"If verification fails, delete index reference\", does
it delete only the search word, or also all other words that are invalid
now (because it reindexes the page anyway)?
