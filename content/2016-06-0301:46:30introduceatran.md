introduce a translation edit servlet Translator_p.html YaCy's UI text translation
This is the 1st rudimentary approach to support the translatio utilities.
It allows currently to edit untranslated text and save it in a local translation file
in the DATA/LOCALE directory.
+ refactor Translator (less static's) to leverage on class overrides and support garbage collection for this 1 time routine
+ adjust TranslatorXliff to check for local translations in DATA/LOCALE,
  this includes storing manually downloaded translation files in DATA as well 
  (to keep default untouched)
+ on 1st call of Translator_p a master tanslation file is generated, checking
the supported languages for missing translation text (later this masterfile is planned to part of the distribution, to harmonize translation key text between the languages)
Outlook: the local modifications (possibly as translation fragments instead of complete file) to be shared with maintainer using xlif features.
