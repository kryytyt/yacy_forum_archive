Implausibly low BP spill cost estimate: \$17.2 Billion.

[![](https://www.jwz.org/images/image-16.jpg)When I read this headline I
could not believe they would estimate it so low, and assumed the study
was funded by the oil
industry:](https://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2017/04/cals-bp.html)

So their estimate of the cost of the spill is based on:

1.  How much survey respondents claim they might be willing to spend to
    save the *cute* animals, and keep their vacation spots pretty;
2.  Estimates of the cost of a program to prevent it from happening in
    the future.

*That is now how you calculate costs!*

We may still learn that this event was a civilization-ender.

And don\'t forget, [*nobody* will ever do any prison

The fact that the BP \"Corporate Person\" has not been executed for this
is a crime against literal Humanity.
