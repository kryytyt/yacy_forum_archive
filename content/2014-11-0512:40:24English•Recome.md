English â€¢ Recomend number of characters for each title in SOL index
===================================================================

Date: 2014-11-05 12:40:24

On Page /IndexSchema\_p.html.\
The value for title\_chars\_val does this chop the title length back in
the index?\
\
I Have been processing one of my Dumps and had string to long error. I
deleted the first 1000 lines of the dump and it was no trouble.\
\
Does anyone have a good number they use on there system.\
Thanks
