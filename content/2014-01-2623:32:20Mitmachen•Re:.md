Hi again, q5sys!,\
\
Many thanks for your detailed comment. Maybe, you are right. I\'m an
Engineer and not a really good businessman.

Maybe we get a RasPi device with some more performance in future and so
the engineering demands meet attractive prizes. I know, RasPi is not
developed to produce updates in a short time manner. It would destroy
the community and the idea. But, we will see.\
\
How my last runs show, the RasPi could have enough power when we
renounce from big crawling tasks. And with actual development versions
of YaCy also CubieTruck and Hetzner vServer run in a problem of
stability. Maybe this is not only a question of CPU power.\
\
This Odroid-U3 looks nice. Interesting prize. 4 cores. Maybe this will
be an additional test platform for me in future. Best thanks for this
link! I read across over the magazine. It shows that the target group is
the same of RasPi and Arduino. It could come a really interesting time.

A good week, Frank!
