Beware that some other credulous \"news\" outlets (that I won\'t link
to) are reporting this using Corporate Preferred Phrasing such as:

> The change is the result of a new partnership announced last week
> between Getty Images and Google.

Hey, raise your hand if you instead wished Image Search would just
entirely exclude by default all the parasitic link-farmers like Getty?
(And Pinterest.)

But wow, it sure is great for Google that now they get to use Getty\'s
massive collection of stultifyingly banal clip art in their future ad
campaigns and web site banners. That\'s a pretty sweet capitulation in
return for kneecapping their second-most-useful product.
