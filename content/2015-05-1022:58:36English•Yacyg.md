English â€¢ Yacy grabbing all the RAM - too many JVM processes
============================================================

Hi there,\
\
I used too run Yacy on a dedicated small A20 Olinuxino board. Now I
start to run a more powerful server, and still intend to use some of its
resources to contribute to the index. However, when running Yacy, all
the RAM (4Gb) is used, whereas I set the limit of the JVM to the
standard 600 Mb. I saw from \"pstree\" and \"htop\" that quite a number
of java processes (\~190 for instance) are running, which I guess
explain that all the RAM is used. I had the same problem before, though
I assumed this issue was related to the resources of the board.\
\
Beside, the \"free\" command shows that quite a part of the RAM is used
in cache (\~1Gb). When stopping Yacy and clearing the cache, I get 3,4
Gb of free RAM, while when Yacy runs all the memory is eaten up (message
of disabling DHT at less than 50 free mb of memory by Yacy).\
\
I think the closest post on the topic is the following
<http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5266&p=30258&hilit=memory#p30258>;
it did not receive an answer at the time.\
\
Did anyone encountered this kind of problems, and what would be the
solution? I would like to limit the use of Yacy to, say, 1Gb in memory.\
\
Thanks,
