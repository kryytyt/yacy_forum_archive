> \"Regular people, not just impersonal, commercially motivated
> merchants or advertising networks, can exploit the online advertising
> ecosystem to extract private information about *other people,* such as
> people that they know or that live nearby,\" reads the [study, titled
> \"Using Ad Targeting for Surveillance on a
> Budget.\"](https://adint.cs.washington.edu/)
>
> The University of Washington researchers didn\'t exploit a bug or
> loophole in mobile advertising networks so much as reimagine the
> motivation and resources of an ad buyer to show how those networks\'
> intentional tracking features allow relatively cheap, highly targeted
> spying. \[\...\]

> \"If you want to make the point that advertising networks should be
> more concerned with privacy, the bogeyman you usually pull out is that
> big corporations know so much about you. But people don\'t really care
> about that,\" says University of Washington researcher Paul Vines.
> \"But the potential person using this information isn\'t some large
> corporation motivated by profits and constrained by potential
> lawsuits. It can be a person with relatively small amounts of money
> and very different motives.\"
