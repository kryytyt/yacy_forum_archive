FB video
========

Dear Lazyweb, how do I post a video to a Facebook page via the API?

Since the [recent
unpleasantness](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/09/seeking-facebooks-iphone-app-key/)
with the Facebook app private key, I can no longer post video to a page
that I manage. Posting images to

`https://graph.facebook.com/page_id/photos?access_token=...`

works fine but posting videos to

`https://graph-video.facebook.com/v2.7/page_id/videos?access_token=...`

gets all the way to the end of the chunked upload and then returns the
error, \"Application does not have the capability to make this API
call\".

What permissions does my app need to have set in order to make this
work? I believe I have both `user_photos` and `user_videos` set.

Apparently you need a special dispensation to get `publish_pages`
permission, but when I requested it, they just said, \"Your app doesn\'t
need to submit for manage\_pages to post to Pages or blogs that you
admin.\" But they won\'t answer when I ask what permission I *do* need.
