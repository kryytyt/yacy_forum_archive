As you can see in this picture, the new crawl I scheduled today is
highlighted in red:\

\
But I didn\'t see any entry at the \"Crawl Profile List\" regarding that
new crawl task, as you can see in the following pic:\

So my concern is if this crawl has been successfully finished or not,
and why (and how to monitor its running progress)
