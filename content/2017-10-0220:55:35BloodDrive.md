I just found out that *Blood Drive* was cancelled. This is tragic. That
show was *fantastic.* Pretty much every episode is an homage to a
different 70s or 80s splatter movie, with a *Death Race* framing story
around it. They do *Big Trouble*, they do *A Boy and His Dog*, one of
the MacGuffins is 2-4-5 Trioxin, from *Return of the Living Dead*. They
even went to a town called Cronenburgh \-- I died. And the season
doesn\'t end on a cliffhanger, so that\'s nice. They had more to tell,
but they wrapped up the first story, more or less.

I had a couple of friends say, \"Um, I watched the first episode and
that was pretty stupid.\" No. That just means you haven\'t acclimated
yet. Have another drink and let it wash over you.
