[Fordite, also known as Detroit agate, is old automobile paint which has
hardened sufficiently to be cut and polished. It was formed from the
built up of layers of enamel paint slag on tracks and skids on which
cars were hand spray-painted (a now automated process), which have been
baked numerous
times.](http://miningeology.blogspot.com/2015/07/the-most-amazing-rocks.html)
