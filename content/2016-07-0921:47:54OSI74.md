It\'s basically a [UHF / public access TV station](http://osi74.com/),
complete with crap old movies being talked over by \"horror hosts\", and
a *vast* amount of Subgenus and GWAR content. What the what?

If we lived in a world where actual entertainment options didn\'t exist
\-- like, say, the 80s \-- this would have been an *invaluable*
resource.

I don\'t know or care what a \"roku\" is but there are hours and hours
of this, let\'s call it \"programming\", [on the
Vimeos](https://vimeo.com/osi74/videos).

And it has, I think they were called, \"commercials?\" And maybe they
are \"real\"? I am so lost right now.

It\'s kind of the second coming of [*Night
Flight*](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2007/04/night-flight/). And, hang on,
apparently [*Night Flight* kind of exists
again](http://www.nightflight.com/) too now? What?

But let me in particular note that
[\"Cosmonauti\"](http://osi74.com/series/utopia-fantastika/) is the
greatest possible name for a horror host, or burlesque performer, or
just about anything.
