Hilfe für Einsteiger und Anwender • Handling non-standard TLD\'s?
=================================================================

Date: 2013-11-21 12:06:42

YaCy looks like it would be really nice for indexing content in
non-standard TLD\'s such as OpenNIC, which Google doesn\'t touch. (I\'m
interested in using it with the Namecoin .bit TLD, which is a
decentralized DNS which is relatively resistant to censorship,
hijacking, and surveillance.) However, obviously it would be bad if
those results started showing up for users who can\'t resolve those
domains. Is there a way to allow users to index nonstandard TLD\'s in
the freeworld network, and have a user option to enable/disable such
TLD\'s from showing up in results (disabled by default)? If there is no
way to do this, is there any chance such a mechanism could be added?\
\
Thanks.
