It seems that I have three options, in This Modern World:

1.  Virtual server.\
    \
    Many options; the big ones are Amazon, Digital Ocean, Google. They
    are probably all about the same. Price is somewhere between \$450
    and \$800/month, maybe?\
    \
    Pro:
    -   Everyone does it this way.
    -   When it is Upgrade Season, spinning up a new instance for
        rebuild/migration is easy.
    -   I will never have to think about disk, RAM or power supplies
        going bad.

    Con:
    -   Expensive.
    -   The way I would be using it would be to have a single instance.
        Nobody does it that way, so it probably doesn\'t work very well.
    -   I need 2TB of file system storage. Nobody does it that way, so
        it\'s expensive.
    -   Figuring out exactly *which* of their many options is the
        configuration that I need is really difficult.
    -   Whatever IP address they give me is probably already on every
        email spam blacklist in the world.

2.  Dedicated server.\
    \
    I\'m seeing numbers anywhere from \$100/month to \$500/month. It\'s
    all over the map, which does not inspire confidence.\
    \
    Pro:
    -   It\'s a real damned computer, with predicable behavior.
    -   When disk, RAM or power supplies go bad, someone else fixes it.
    -   I never need to physically visit it.

    Con:
    -   It is hard to tell whether the companies that offer this service
        will still be in business two years from now.
    -   It\'s hard to tell whether they are real companies, or \"one
        flaky guy\".
    -   Spinning up a new instance in Upgrade Season is somewhat more
        involved, and maybe costs me a couple hundred bucks.
    -   Though it *can* be located anywhere, since all of my customers
        are in San Francisco, it probably *should* be on the West Coast.
        That narrows the already narrow field of options.
    -   People keep recommending companies that are not hosted in the
        country I live in. This strikes me as extremely foolish for
        several reasons.

3.  Bare rack slot, with my own home-built 1U computer in it.\
    \
    Probably something like \$100/month, plus the cost of the computer
    (say, \$1000, will last 4 years).\
    \
    Pro:
    -   It\'s a real damned computer, with predicable behavior.
    -   Cheap.

    Con:
    -   Hardware failures are my problem.
    -   Spinning up a new instance in Upgrade Season is a huge pain in
        the ass.
    -   The data center has to be local, because I probably need to go
        physically visit it every year or two.

Figuring this out is *such* a pain in the butt. I really want to believe
that option 1 is the way to go, but I\'d need to get the price down
(*without* first needing to completely re-design the way I do absolutely
everything, thanks), and it just sounds like it\'s going to be flaky.

Options 2 and 3 sound flaky in their own ways. Pro: I already understand
those ways. Con: one of those ways is why I\'m looking to move in the
first place.
