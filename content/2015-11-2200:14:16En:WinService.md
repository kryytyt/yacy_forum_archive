YaCy distribution includes a script to install it as Windows service.\
\
\<code\>installYaCyWindowsService.bat\</code\>\
\
== Installation ==\
\* install YaCy as normal application and configure it as desired.\
\* stop YaCy\
\* call the \'\'installYaCyWindowsService.bat\'\' in the main YaCy
directory\
\
This installs YaCy as Windows service with startmode = auto, so that
YaCy is automatically started at Windows startup.\
The name of the service is \'\'YaCy\'\'\
\
== Uninstall Service ==\
To uninstall the service call\
\'\'uninstallYaCyWindowsService.bat\'\'\
This will uninstall the service only. The YaCy installation is not
effected by this.\
\
== Details ==\
As service launcher, Apache Commons Daemon is used. The executables are
located in subdirectory \'\'addon/windowsService\'\'.\
You can configure some details of the service, like the maximum memory
or the start parameter. Commons Daemon includes a small GUI for this.
You may call this manually by executing \'\'prunmgr //ES//YaCy\'\' in
directory \'\'addon/windowsService\'\'.\
