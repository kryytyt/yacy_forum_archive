Fragen und Antworten â€¢ What does verify=true do?
================================================

Date: 2015-11-25 03:51:54

I\'m trying to figure out exactly what verify=true does. I\'ve looked
through the wiki but haven\'t found any detailed documentation. Is
anyone able to explain precisely what YaCy checks in the downloaded page
when verify=true is set?\
\
For example, is it checking that one of the search terms appears
somewhere in the text of the page? All of the search terms? Does it
recalculate the Solr entry for the page? Does it recalculate the
outgoing link graph for the page?\
\
Thanks.
