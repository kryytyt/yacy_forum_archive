Did you have a look at LOG/yacy00.log file? It would be interesting to
check if something is written (eventually errors) when you try to start
YaCy.\
\
How do you know your yacy.conf file was damaged? Maybe some other key
files were also damaged\...\
\
Alternatively, I guess you can try to use content of yacy.init
([https://github.com/yacy/yacy\_search\_ser \...
/yacy.init](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/master/defaults/yacy.init){.postlink})
to manually fill your yacy.conf file.
