[Launige Geschichte über den Opiumanbau in
Afghanistan](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/05/afghan-poppies/all/).
Darin werden die Regeln für US-Soldaten in der Region beschrieben

> They're not allowed to actually step foot in Sartok's many acres of
> poppy fields or damage the fields in any way.
>
> They can't even threaten to destroy the fields or send in Afghan
> troops to burn, plow under or poison the delicate, pastel-colored
> flowers.
>
> Nor can they discourage poppy farmers, however gently, from growing
> their illicit crop, which is hardier and commands a higher price than
> alternatives such as wheat. Poppy cultivation has been illegal in
> Afghanistan since 2001 but still represents a full quarter of the
> country's gross domestic product
