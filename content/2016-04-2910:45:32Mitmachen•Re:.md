Hi, I was recently reading about foundations supporting free software
projects. I found some ones which I think are matching YaCy goals, and
are calling for funding application with a deadline coming soon :\
- NLnet Foundation : <https://nlnet.nl/news/2016/20160601-call-en.html>\
- Internet Freedom Fund : [https://www.opentech.fund/requests/inte \...
eedom-fund](https://www.opentech.fund/requests/internet-freedom-fund){.postlink}\
\
I am considering applying to support full time developer work on YaCy
for one or a few people. The main roadmap could be something like :\
- stemming of search queries : current one is quite basic\
- performances : better control over disk and CPU use\
- image and media search : improve results relevance\
- mobile terminal use : current web interface should be improved for
better compatibility\
- accessibility : administrative web interface would benefit from code
review and testing with accessibility tools\
- easier ranking control : it must easier for users to customize ranking
algorithm\
- deployment for end users or for web portal administrators : more
deployment options (desktop, cloud containers\...) and more detailed
procedures for admins are needed\
- integration of existing external indexes : extend existing
options(wikis, OAI-PMH, phpbbb forums) to other relevant formats\
- detailed code review with security in mind : to target a larger
audience, security can not be ignored\
- modularization : it could be beneficial to split the monolithic
project into well defined independent modules, eventually exchangeable\
- documentation : protocol, API and end-user documentation has evolved
slower than code\
- peer implementation with WebRTC : an alternative peer implementation
running purely in browser would lower entry barrier for newcomers\
\
Any suggestion? Do you think it is a good idea?
