Once again luc, thank you for the response.\
\
As far as I can tell, the expert crawls were started with:\
\

> <div>
>
> \
> Load Filter on URLs\
> must-match\
> \
> Use filter.\*\
> (must not be empty)\
> must-not-match\
>
> </div>

\
\

> <div>
>
> \
> Document Filter\
> These are limitations on index feeder. The filters will be applied
> after a web page was loaded.\
> \
> Filter on URLs\
> \
> must-match.\*\
> (must not be empty)\
> must-not-match\
> \
> Filter on Content of Document\
> (all visible text, including camel-case-tokenized url and title)\
> \
> must-match.\*\
> (must not be empty)\
> must-not-match\
>
> </div>

I\'ll keep digging. As there is no easy way to use an API to re-create
the expert crawls, I\'ll have to restart a few of them to see if it
changes.
