Hi, JavaFX now provides an ant packaging task including Mac OS as a
target :
[self-contained-packaging](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/deploy/self-contained-packaging.html#sthref60){.postlink}\
Maybe this can help? Unfortunately I can not check this before next
Friday when I can have a MacBook available.\
\
[Edit :]{style="font-weight: bold"} looking a little more deeply at
JavaFX packaging tools, it looks like it could indeed be useful, but
probably not with current YaCy sources structure (see Classpath related
issues encountered when [trying to
package](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=5762){.postlink}
a one runnable jar for a Java Web Start version of YaCy)
