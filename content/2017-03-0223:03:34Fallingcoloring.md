> Beginning in late 2015, sales of gimmicky books full of complicated
> illustrations skyrocketed. Publishers talked about the appeal of the
> \"therapeutic value of coloring,\" and worked up ways to sell packaged
> bundles of products, such as CDs and colored pencils. The result was
> good for bookstores and the publishing industry as a whole, which saw
> sales of nonfiction books rise 12 percent during the first half of
> 2016 compared to 2015. As publishers and brick-and-mortar bookstores
> face increasing competition from online retailers such as Amazon, the
> coloring book boost was a welcome change.
