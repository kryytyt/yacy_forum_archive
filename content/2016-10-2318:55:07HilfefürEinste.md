Hi konkretor,\
indeed you configured your peer to have the less detailed logs\...\
\
Log levels are organized this way : from OFF (no logs at all) to FINE
(detailed debugging information), you get more and more detailed logs.
The ordered levels list is : OFF, SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE\
\
So I suggest you modify your log level at least to INFO or even FINE,
and if no error is reported, at least you will be able to know what the
process is doing before crashing.
