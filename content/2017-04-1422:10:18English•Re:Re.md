Hi Luc ! I\'m trying now the full recrawl plan. For full recrawl I mean
that I\'ve inserted again all the websites of the index and recrawled
it. I don\'t understand how to cron this. It\'s a shame that there
isn\'t a way to keep the index automatically updated. I\'m not a
programmer and there is probably a big issue about this functionality.\

Thank you again for your response. If somebody will donate me few bucks
I will have the money to pay a programmer
