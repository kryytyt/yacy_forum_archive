English â€¢ yacysearch.json: wait for local results
=================================================

Date: 2015-10-22 17:29:03

Global searches made thru yacysearch.json return results too fast, so
fast that results from the local index aren\'t parsed in time to get
included in the returned results set.\
The data contained in my local index, specifically crawled for from
chosen sites, constitutes the most pertinent pool of results I want to
retrieve when searching. On the other hand, results retrieved via p2p
are not as context-specific as those in my own index, thus less relevant
to my queries. Most often, the results I receive are sourced solely from
p2p, due to unpredictable timeout to query my hard disks.\
\
The server load is not constant over time, so I cannot simply re-run the
query after a defined timeout to allow enough time for local results to
be collected from my hard disks. Besides, the disks serving Yacy may
vary in number and quality (IOps) over time.\
\
What would be needed is an adjustable setting ---possibly an additional
query parameter--- to specifically ask Yacy to wait for local results
while performing a global query.
