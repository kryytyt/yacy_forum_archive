As far as I understood, the web panel provides an option to pick a
custom network name. IIRC, yacy comes preconfigured with a specific
network name thru which all nodes are connected by default, forming the
global public network.\
Still AFAIK, to make a private cluster you have to set all your nodes
under a same network name, which is just a text string, editable
somewhere from the web panel.\
\
However, for a private search engine I had better switched from yacy to
[OSS](http://opensearchserver.com/){.postlink}, only because I was
impressed by how terrible search results are in yacy.\
OSS is tougher to set up, but it\'s not only usable, it also works quite
well and has decent search result.
