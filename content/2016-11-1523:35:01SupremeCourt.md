Immediately appoint Merrick Garland to the Supreme

> The citizens of the United States have a right to the good faith
> consideration of each Supreme Court nominee. In an attempt to subvert
> the will of the people expressed in the reelection of President Barack
> Obama in 2012, the current Senate has willfully failed to make a
> timely assertion of their advise and consent right.
>
> There is legal precedent in United States v. Olano which ruled that
> the holder of a constitutional right may waive the right by engaging
> in an excessive delay in exercising it.
>
> Merrick Garland was nominated on March 16, 2016, more than 237 days
> ago, greatly exceeding the previous maximum consideration delay of 125
> days. The Senate has waived its right. Please proceed with Judge
> Garland\'s appointment.
>
> *Needs 47,525 signatures by December 9 to get a response from the
> White House.*
