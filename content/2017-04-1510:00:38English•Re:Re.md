With the YaCy Process Scheduler (/Table\_API\_p.html) you just have to
:\
- find your last crawl start action(s) : in that page you can search for
\"crawl\" or sort by \"Recording Date\" by clicking on that column for
example\
- in the \"Scheduler\" column, select the \"activate scheduler\" combo
box option and then the appropriate periodicity.\
\
With cron on a linux machine it is also quite simple :\
- first try to start your crawl from command line : for example with the
help of YaCy bin/apicall.sh script and using the parameters recorded in
the /Table\_API\_p.html\
- then schedule this command line as a cron job : see for example the
related Debian
[documentation](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-handbook/sect.task-scheduling-cron-atd.en.html){.postlink}\
\
But of course I agree it is not super user friendly : why not share here
some ideas of which feature would make it easier? Some ideas :\
- an option in the crawl start page to tell directly that you will want
to run this task regularly?\
- a new specific page with a list of websites/URLs whose index should be
maintened up-to-date?\
