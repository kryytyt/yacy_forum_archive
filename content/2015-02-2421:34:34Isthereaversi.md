Is there a version of Text::Diff::HTML that actually works?
===========================================================

[Text::Diff](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-Diff-HTML/lib/Text/Diff/HTML.pm)
often goes into a busy-loop when diffing files that have only a few
lines of changes. How\'s that even possible? Why, it\'s because instead
of running and parsing `diff`, they *reimplemented diff themselves in
Perl.* Because reasons. Seriously, look at
[Algorithm::Diff](http://search.cpan.org/~tyemq/Algorithm-Diff-1.1903/lib/Algorithm/Diff.pm)
\-- it reads like it was literally someone\'s homework assignment.

I just want to take two text files and get side-by-side HTML/colored
output of the differences. Is there something simple that works, or do I
have Two Problems?
