> \"Prior to the tech industry, no one had really considered creating

> Not everything has gone well since then, Harris admitted. \"The
> problem with Burning Man is that since the tech industry invented it,
> it\'s gotten so popular that all these artists are showing up, and
> they don\'t know anything about the culture.\"

> That\'s also a problem with what many see as the tech industry\'s
