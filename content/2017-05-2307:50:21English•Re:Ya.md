Hi eros,\
thanks for your feedback, this is interesting to know that the upgrade
to Java 1.8 seems to solve your initial problem.\
\
Regarding the error on index export, I recently fixed some issues with
this feature notably a NullPointerException case (see commit
[e5858bc](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commit/e5858bc8c8d330b7d25eafd1d5328b48dfbb1618){.postlink}
on the GitHub repository). So if you want to have a try\... you just
have to build and install [your own
deb](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server#how-to-get-the-source-code-and-how-to-compile-yacy-yourself){.postlink}
package from latest source. Not very difficult, and you will also
benefit from all the other fixes and improvements made since release
1.92/9000.
