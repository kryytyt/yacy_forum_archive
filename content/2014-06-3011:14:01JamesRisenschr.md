[James Risen schreibt mal wieder was in der New York
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/us/before-shooting-in-iraq-warning-on-blackwater.html).
Der ist generell empfehlenswert, und enttÃ¤uscht auch dieses Mal nicht:

> Just weeks before Blackwater guards fatally shot 17 civilians at
> Baghdad's Nisour Square in 2007, the State Department began
> investigating the security contractor's operations in Iraq. **But the
> inquiry was abandoned after Blackwater's top manager there issued a
> threat: "that he could kill" the government's chief investigator and
> "no one could or would do anything about it as we were in Iraq,"**
> according to department reports.

Das ist ja mal krass!
