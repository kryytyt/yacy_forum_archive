Hi Orbiter, on each YaCy js file I searched for contributors through the
git history. I looked for their corresponding names only in publicly
available information :\
- /AUTHORS file\
- in other YaCy source files where a header mentioned the contributor
with his pseudo and his name\
- on this forum : some people mention their personal website in their
profile\
Thank you for reviewing, and good luck.
