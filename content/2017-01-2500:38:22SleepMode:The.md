Mode: The Art of the
Screensaver*](http://sleepmode.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en) is an
exhibition curated by RafaÃ«l Rozendaal at Rotterdam\'s [Het Nieuwe
Instituut](http://hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en/museum) from January 27 until
June 25.

I think this is awesome, because screen savers don\'t get the respect
that they deserve.

There are some from [XScreenSaver](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/) in
there but I\'m not sure exactly which. I\'m also really curious what the
physical exhibition space looks like, but there aren\'t any photos of it
yet.

[He says](http://sleepmode.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en/interview):

> What fascinates me is that so many people saw screensavers on a daily
> basis, without really looking at them carefully. I found it
> interesting that the images could lodge themselves subconsciously in
> our brains. It was a matter of recognising something you were never
> fully conscious of. You never wondered where it came from or who made
> it, or what their intention was. That is why I didn\'t search for
> obscure examples, but stuck to familiar screensavers.
>
> For me the idea of staring is very important. When you are tired and
> just gazing blankly at what is in front of you. Most of the things we
> do on the computer are done with a purpose in mind, but screensavers
> relate to a very different part of your brain. That is why I like the
> title Sleep Mode. Most art is best experienced by just looking at it
> without thinking too much.

He interviewed me and five other screen saver makers about the purpose
and history of screen savers. I am saddened to report that I\'m the only
one of them who actually *uses* a screen saver any more! What a world,
what a world. In the interview one of the questions he asked was, [\"Do
you see a future for
screensavers?\"](http://sleepmode.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en/screensaver-makers)
and I am afraid that I felt obliged to deploy the snark:

> Any time some pedantic jerk says \"YOU KNOW, screen savers aren\'t
> really NECESSARY with modern monitors\" I want to ask them \"How awful
> is it to have been born without a soul?\" Screen savers are art. As
> long as computers have screens, people will make art for them. I also
> find it amusing when I am in an art museum or gallery and see a
> \"digital installation\" where the only difference between that work
> and a \"screen saver\" is that they wrote an \"artist\'s statement\"
> about how it explores the dichotomy between whatever \-- and/or
> someone gave them a grant for it.\"
