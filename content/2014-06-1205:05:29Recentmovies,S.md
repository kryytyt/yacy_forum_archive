Recent movies, Singularity edition
==================================

How did I end up seeing four Singularity movies in a row? Normally I\'d
say \"bad decision-making\", but three of them were actually good:

[**The Machine:**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2317225/) Military
reconstructive prosthetics lead to accidental hive-minding. Very pretty,
nice effects. Naked robot fu.

[**Her:**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/) Siri is a really great
girlfriend, until she ascends. People are remarkably supportive of
someone dating their phone (that\'s how you know it\'s science fiction).
It\'s way better than I expected it to be.

[**Transcendence:**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2209764/) This was
complete bullshit. Fuck this movie.

[**The Congress:**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1821641/) Lawyers ruin
everything, including the Singularity, which looks exactly like
Toontown. This movie is bizarre and absolutely fantastic. It never
occurred to me that Chuck Jones might be the architect of our
drug-addled post-physical existence. That whole \"lawyers ruin
everything\" thing was a given, though.
