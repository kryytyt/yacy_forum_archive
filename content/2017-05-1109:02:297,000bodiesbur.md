Wow. This is a lot like saying, *\"More than 6,000 \'stayed\' at the
prison, providing many jobs\",* or *\"More than 6,000 African immigrants
\'stayed\' at the plantation, providing many jobs\".*

[*Malformed: Forgotten Brains of the Texas State Mental
Hospital*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1576877086/) is an amazing
book that not only has some fantastically creepy photos, but also goes
into a lot of detail about what kind of horrible snakepits these sorts
of facilities were. It\'s probably worse than you imagine, even if that
imagination is based solely on low budget horror movies.
