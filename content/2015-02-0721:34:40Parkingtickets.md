Parking tickets by the truckload
================================

Date: 2015-02-07 21:34:40

Let me get this straight: faced with international corporations who
repeatedly and blatantly violate the law, *and* have the balls to
publicly state that violating the law is *part of their business plan*,
the local government\'s response is to make it *cheaper and easier* for
those companies to continue breaking the law?

This article is from 2007, but I assume the situation has only gotten
more ridiculous since then.

> San Francisco began its corporate program in 1998. The intent was

> Lynch, spokeswoman for the MTA.
>
> Companies can enroll if they have at least 20 vehicles that park on
> city streets and if they have what Lynch described as \"a history of
> citations.\" The participating firms are billed monthly and cannot
> protest the tickets. In return, they avoid late fees and having their
> vehicles clamped with immobilizing boots when a vehicle accrues five
> or more parking tickets.

> \"Drivers used to hide their citations from management, so companies

> Delivery companies enrolled in the program are the biggest parking
> violators, accruing almost \$1.3 million in fines. \[\...\]

> \"I get tickets all the time, probably three or four a week,\" said
> Gonzalez, who has 10 years on the job.

> Most of his tickets are for double parking. On the Bryant Street run,

> \"This is part of the price of doing business,\" said Jim McCluskey, a
> spokesman for FedEx, which paid San Francisco \$434,046 for 7,711
> tickets \[in 2006\]. \"We encourage our operators to park legally, but
> we also need to meet the needs of our customers who want reliable,
> on-time service.\"
