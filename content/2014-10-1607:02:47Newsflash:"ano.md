> There has been a lot of online comment recently about a dataset
> released by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. It
> contains details about every taxi ride (yellow cabs) in New York in
> 2013, including the pickup and drop off times, locations, fare and tip
> amounts, as well as anonymized (hashed) versions of the taxi\'s
> license and medallion numbers. It was obtained via a FOIL request
> earlier this year and has been making waves in the hacker community
> ever since.
>
> The release of this data in this unalloyed format raises several
> privacy concerns. The most well-documented of these deals with the
> hash function used to \"anonymize\" the license and medallion numbers.
> A bit of lateral thinking from one civic hacker and the data was
> completely de-anonymized. This data can now be used to calculate, for
> example, any driver\'s annual income. More disquieting, though, in my
> opinion, is the privacy risk to passengers. With only a small amount
> of auxiliary knowledge, using this dataset an attacker could identify
> where an individual went, how much they paid, weekly habits, etc. I
> will demonstrate how easy this is to do in the following section.
