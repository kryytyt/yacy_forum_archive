> Given a state-of-the-art deep neural network classifier, we show the
> existence of a universal (image-agnostic) and very small perturbation
> vector that causes natural images to be misclassified with high
> probability. We propose a systematic algorithm for computing universal
> perturbations, and show that state-of-the-art deep neural networks are
> highly vulnerable to such perturbations, albeit being
> quasi-imperceptible to the human eye. \[\...\]

> Can we find a *single* small image perturbation that fools a
> state-of-the-art deep neural network classifier on all natural images?
> We show in this paper the existence of such quasi-imperceptible
> *universal* perturbation vectors that lead to misclassified natural
> images with high probability. Specifically, by adding such a
> *quasi-imperceptible* perturbation to natural images, the label
> estimated by the deep neural network is changed with high probability.
>
> Such perturbations are dubbed *universal,* as they are image-agnostic.
> The existence of these perturbations is problematic when the
> classifier is deployed in real-world (and possibly hostile)
> environments, as such a single perturbation can be exploited by
> adversaries to break the classifier. Indeed, the perturbation process
> involves the mere addition of one very small perturbation to all
> natural images, and can be relatively straightforward to implement by
> adversaries in real-world environments, while being relatively
> difficult to detect as such perturbations are very small and thus do
> not significantly affect data distributions. The surprising existence
> of universal perturbations further reveals new insights on the
> topology of the decision boundaries of deep neural networks.

This technology could dramatically impact the SCORPION STARE program.
But I know how I\'m convolving my selfies from now on!
