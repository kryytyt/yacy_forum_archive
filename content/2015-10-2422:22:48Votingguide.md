gonna be lazy here and just cut-and-paste what [Jason said on

> Dear SF voters,
>
> Six of the eleven propositions for the Nov 4 San Francisco election
> relate to housing, development, and the preserving of arts/culture
> spaces. This election is not only important for San Franciscans, but
> will set precedents for how other cities deal with corporate-led
> gentrification.
>
> Here\'s a cheat sheet that has been approved by all the current
> community organizations and social justice groups. I\'m not asking you
> to vote exactly the same as everything listed. Please do your own
> research and make up your own mind. I\'m a bit torn on D, but agree
> with everything else.
>
> The most important parts of this election are:
>
> 1\. Unseating our corrupt mayor Ed Lee. There are three candidates all
> working together (imagine that!) to accomplish this. Vote for any one of
> them, anyone but Ed Lee.

> Mayor: [1-2-3, Anyone But Ed Lee!](http://vote123sf.com/)

> 2\. Housing Propositions
>
> -   PROP A: Borrow \$310M For Affordable Housing - Yes
> -   PROP D: Mission Rock Development - Yes
> -   PROP F: Enforceable Regulations on AirBnB-Type Rentals - Yes
> -   PROP I: Pause New Luxury Housing in the Mission - Yes
> -   PROP J: Help Preserve Legacy Businesses - Yes
> -   PROP K: Use Surplus City Property for Affordable Housing - Yes
>
> Word on the street is that Prop F has a ton of public support, but
> Prop I still needs people to vote for it. [The Armory /
> Kink.com](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Armory-Kinkcom/207951662595972),
> among others, is campaigning against Prop I under the guise of \"Save
> the Music.\" They\'re lying about the nature of the proposed luxury
> housing moratorium and claiming that Prop I will shut them down. This
> is entirely false. The only effect Prop I will have on the Armory is
> an 18 month delay of the permits it needs to become a more a permanent
> venue. Since they can\'t have it NOW NOW NOW they\'d rather campaign
> against the community and their own neighborhood.

be stopping by [Monday Night
Hubba](https://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2015/10-26d.html) this Monday
to say a few words. He said, \"Talking at a comedy titty show is about
as \'on message\' as could be!\"
