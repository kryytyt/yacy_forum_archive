Hi tb0hdan,\
to my own taste, in a decentralized perspective, a good demo could be an
on-line and anonymously deployable temporary YaCy container, in the
spirit of what can be done for example on
[Sandstorm.io](https://sandstorm.io/){.postlink} \"Quick demo\".\
\
But that\'s right that there was a time where search.yacy.net was
configured as a demo portal acting as a load balancer. I wonder if it is
really relevant : unless I do not understand it correctly, the idea that
when you reach the load balancer front, it selects one member of the
cluster and then you get the search page and results from this peer,
isn\'t it?\
So I am not sure automatically integrating YaCy peers to this cluster is
really a good idea :\
- some may have very different settings than the default ones\
- some may not want to be part of this cluster\
\
But if being part of the demo cluster is done on a voluntary basis (as
for the NTP pool), why not\...
