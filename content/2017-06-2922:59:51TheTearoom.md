> In 1962, the Mansfield, Ohio police department setup a hidden
> surveillance camera behind a two-way mirror, and secretly filmed dudes
> having sex with dudes in a public bathroom. The police used the film
> footage to imprison them for a year or more under Ohio\'s sodomy laws.
>
> Today in 2017, police still target men who have sex with men \-- and
> in video game land, I still have to deal with Twitch banning my gay
> games by secret trial as if they\'re the fucking game police. So to
> appease this oppressive conservative gamer-surveillance complex, I
> have swapped out any pesky penises in my game for the only thing that
> the game industry will never moderate nor ban \-- guns. Now, there\'s
> nothing wrong with guys appreciating other guys\' guns, right?
