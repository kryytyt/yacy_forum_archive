English â€¢ Proxy all crawler traffic
===================================

Date: 2015-06-17 14:28:35

Is it possible to canalize all crawler requests thru a proxy? If so,
how?\
\
It is a necessity for me to change YaCy UA, in a way or another. A proxy
header rewrite is the easiest and most upgradable solution until your
minds will be free from the UA dogma.\
I\'m talking very pragmatically here, meanwhile measuring the benefits
and savings of adopting YaCy over custom solutions, which I\'m
progressively evaluating.
