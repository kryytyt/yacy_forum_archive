> You might not have known that Etsy was full of witches, or
> \"spellcasters\", as many identify themselves. Historically, the
> website has been a favourite for supernatural sellers, and not just
> because its DIY aesthetic fits with home voodoo and casual shamanism.
>
> But now, in a move even clairvoyants might have missed, the witches of
> Etsy are being ousted from their online home. Forum threads have
> sprung up filled with embittered hoodoo practitioners and sellers of
> healing crystals, detailing the ban of sales of \"spell packs, herbs,
> and blessed jewellery.\"
>
> Victoria Zasikowski, a seller of spells and readings on Etsy and
> Bonanza (another online marketplace more tolerant to sellers of
> \"intangibles\") contacted me \[\...\] Swathes of us have now had our
> sales and shop views tank, and there is great distress in the
> metaphysical community.\"
