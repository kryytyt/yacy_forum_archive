[Niklas Roy: Next Level: Suck the Balls Level

> This time, the pneumatic track is roughly 70 meters long. It goes from
> the entrance hall, through the staircase into the first floor, where
> it passes the institute\'s library, then it makes its way back to the
> ground floor. The balls race through the entire pipe system within 11
> seconds, which makes them in average 22.91 km/h fast (The video above
> is in slow motion). That\'s stunning to watch and fun to play with.
> Give it a visit when you\'re in Prague!

> Participants are encouraged to put their golf ball into an entrance in
> the wall. After a few seconds of rattling, the ball becomes visible
> through an opening in the broken lathe, stuck inside the wall. The
> goal is to figure out how to get the ball out from behind the wall so
> it can be used to play the adjacent mini golf course.
>
> A source of light seems to be moving inside, towards an opening in the
> bottom of the wall. Inside that opening, a small luminous being is
> visible, standing on piece of wood, slumped over and depleted.
>
> Participants interact with the being by putting their arms through
> ceramic portholes in the wall, using their hands to first provide
> \"energy\" to the being and then to provide a physical platform for it
> to jump onto.
