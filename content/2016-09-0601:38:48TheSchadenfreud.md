Seriously though, how much popcorn.gif did you need just to get through
that article about Camp White Guilt or White Bread or whatever at
Burning Man getting vandalized? It\'s so adorable when the 0.1% feel
like they\'re being taken advantage of by the 0.01%!

I don\'t understand why they were targeted. Apparently the camp was
started by Paul fucking Oakenfold and the son of a Russian gangster, and
what exemplifies the Burning Man ethos of arena trance and half-baked
Trustafarian Socialism more than that? I assume miniature giraffes were
provided to all of the
[glampers](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/09/glamping-luxe-nomadic/) as
soon as they got off the helicopter.

I sure hope there\'s a TED talk about this.
