Fragen und Antworten • Re: Firewall port 8090 - opening
=======================================================

Date: 2013-08-10 09:55:49

Hi everybody, I\'m also new using Yacy (thanks to Snowden) and I
installed it in win 8.1 pre-reléase. I can use 2 different ISP\'s -with
different routers- and eventually (1 out of 10 times) when I\'m using
one of them I get the message that I\'m running in \"Senior mode\"
sharing the index to everybody in the network. With the other ISP I
never get that message even though I already checked the router
settings, firewall is disabled and tried utility called scanport.exe
which reports my 8090 port as \"open\". I think sometimes is an issue
coming from the ISP that is blocking the port somehow. Do you know if
it\'s possible to redirect the port or create a virtual machine that can
find the port open?\
\
My Windows firewall is disabled and my ESET Smart security 6 has the
rule to open the port as well for both tcp and udp incoming and
outgoing.\
\
I don\'t know what else to do, but I\'ll be happy to hear your
suggestions.\
\
Thanks.
