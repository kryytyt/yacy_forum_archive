Hi reger, I also recently saw that some projects such as the Nu Html
Checker provide a complete set of binary files with their GitHub
[releases](https://github.com/validator/validator/releases){.postlink}.\

I didn\'t test the release creation process, but I also think it would
be a good idea to provide this additional download URL.
