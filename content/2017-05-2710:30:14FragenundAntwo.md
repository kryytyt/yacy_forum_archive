Ok, as far as I know your settings look fine, and 8GB dedicated to YaCy
should be enough. When having some time I will try to run a similar
scenario as the one your describe (MediaWiki import while crawling) and
check what happens.\
\
For information, a tip that may be useful to help debugging that kind of
failure case : run YaCy with the

Code: 
:   `-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError`

advanced JVM option (present as a comment in YaCy sources
[build.xml](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/Release_1.92/build.xml#L683){.postlink}
file), will produce a heap memory dump once the OutOfMemoryError occurs.
This dump can be then opened with a tool such as JVisualVM and it can
really help finding what part of the code is using too much memory.
