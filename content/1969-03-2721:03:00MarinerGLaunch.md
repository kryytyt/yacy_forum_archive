The launch of Mariner G toward Mars, originally scheduled for 1:58 p.m.
PST Monday, March 24, has been postponed for at least 3 days because of
problems with the spacecraft\'s on-board computer and one of its science
instruments. Project officials said the spacecraft will be de-mated from
the Atlas Centaur vehicle tonight, and the two subsystems will be
replaced.
