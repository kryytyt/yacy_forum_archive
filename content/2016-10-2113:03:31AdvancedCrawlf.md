Advanced Crawl from local file : better processing of large files.

Applied strategy : when there is no restriction on domains or
sub-path(s), stack anchor links once discovered by the content scraper
instead of waiting the complete parsing of the file. 

This makes it possible to handle a crawling start file with thousands of
links in a reasonable amount of time.

Performance limitation : even if the crawl start faster with a large
file, the content of the parsed file still is fully loaded in memory.
