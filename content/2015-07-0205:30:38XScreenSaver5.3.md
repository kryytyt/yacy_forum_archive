[XScreenSaver 5.33](http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/) out now. [iOS
version](http://itunes.apple.com/app/xscreensaver/id539014593), too.

-   New hacks, **Splitflap** and **Romanboy**. There are some fun,
    physical-glitch behaviors in splitflap. Keep looking.

-   Better detection of user activity on modern (*ha*) GNOME systems.

-   **Sonar** now does asynchronous host name resolution.

-   Vastly improved Unicrud and Z̧\"̘̖̫̱̖͉̬͈̥͔̳͎̝͜͡A\"͍̹̮̺͓̤̺̺̖̤̥̖͍͎̙̫̫͙̜L͉̹̙͎̻̱̳̦͢͞Ǵ̶̷̛̠̠͕̯͖͈̟̝̮ͅǪ̩͔̪̲͍̹̩͕̕͠͝ͅ support.

-   Performance improvements on MacOS and iOS.

-   The Android port is coming along nicely. It\'s not quite to the
    point where it\'s time for me to post an `.apk` file yet, but it\'s
    getting there. If you have an Android development system, please
    give it a spin and let us know how it works for you.
    `xscreensaver/android/README`.

-   And, you know, other stuff.
