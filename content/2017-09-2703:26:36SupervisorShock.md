> Some two-thirds of citations for driving in transit lanes and bike
> lanes, failing to yield to pedestrians, and other motor vehicle
> violations, are issued to Transportation Network Company (TNC) cars
> such as Uber and Lyft \-- this according to a study from the police
> department of violations in downtown San Francisco. \[\...\]
>
> What makes the numbers so shocking, said Supervisor Aaron Peskin, is
> that they are so disproportionate. \"You have one out of four cars
> being a TNC in the district I represent,\" he said. \"You would think
> the number of violations would be the same, one out of four, but what
> you\'re seeing is the opposite \-- almost three out of four are TNC
> drivers.\"
>
> \"It was really astonishing to see the number of TNCs that routinely
> use the bike lane as the drop off spot with no regard to the fact that
> cyclists are using it,\" said Supervisor Jeff Sheehy, who sits on the
> committee. He joined a protest for protected bike lanes on Valencia
> this month.
>
> \"These numbers confirm what our members experience on the streets of
> San Francisco everyday: Uber and Lyft drivers violating the law and
> threatening the safety of people who bike and walk. Now that SFPD data
> proves they are doing so in numbers far disproportionate to their
> share of traffic volume, this should be a wake-up call to the city and
> the industry,\" wrote Brian Wiedenmeier, the SF Bike Coalition\'s
> executive director, in an email to Streetsblog. \[\...\]
>
> Streetsblog would like to point out that while San Francisco currently
> has little power to regulate TNCs, aside from continuing to issue
> citations, it can, obviously, regulate street design. As the
> human-protected bike lane protests have shown, TNCs aren\'t an issue
> when they are physically prevented from stopping in a bike lane.
> Properly designed protected bike lanes and intersections can make much
> of this a moot point. And banning private cars from Market Street will
> make much of this a moot point too \-- more so if the Supervisors and
> SFMTA have the fortitude to ban all cars, instead of just privately
> owned ones. Continuing to do studies and discuss parking needs, and
> tearing out unofficial safe-hit posts, instead of installing protected
> bike lanes as quickly as possible \-- not so much.
