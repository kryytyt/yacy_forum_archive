Prevent high CPU load at startup, caused by the Solr suggester build.

Reported by Collision on mantis 758 (
http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=758 ).
Introduced by the new YaCy Solr configuration for Solr 6.6.0 (see commit
6fe735945da97abcbb91ac545fb11cff9d48effc), including now Suggester
configuration.
