migration to Solr 5.2: huge benefits - this is a lot faster!

This is a very complex migration: many classes had been renamed or
removed, dependencies changed and the solr index type is now aligned to
be a solr cloud repository.
Together with the Solr 5.2 library update, one other dependent library
had been updated as well: httpclient 4.4->4.4.1

Older indexes are migrated from 4_10 to 5_2. However, the new index
structure is more efficient and we recommend to re-index everything.
Please use the index export before you do the update to a large
surrogate xml file. After the update, start with an empty index and then
initialize this with your dump.
