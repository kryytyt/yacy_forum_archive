Yes.\
Like I suggested above, there are two possible aproaches when you want
to use Cacti for monitoring: by collecting monitoring data thru any SNMP
OID (either pre-package or custom ones) or thru a script.\
I\'ve chosen the second alternative (not exactly sure why
![:roll:](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif "Rolling Eyes")
) and I\'ve been collecting and monitoring Yacy data from two sources:
<http://myserver:8090/Network.xml> and
<http://myserver:8090/PerformanceMemory_p.xml>.\
Below follow some screenshots of what you get, as well as attachments
for the Cacti templates and the scripts for those who want to try.\
DISCLAIMER: Those two C scripts were my first C programs (I\'m an old
COBOL programmer
![8-)](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif "Cool")
so they probably can be optimized and better stylished. Nevertheless,
they\'re running smoothly (at least in my Ubuntu 14.04 server).\

In Cacti, you can expand any of the graphs above by clicking on them.
Below, a screenshot of one of them:\

Also, I had some minor issues regarding file locks, when executing the
scripts, due to the way I designed the data collecting process: instead
of directly reading the web xml produced by Yacy (too much for my zero
knowledge in C), I chose to create two crontab entries to download the
xml from Yacy to local files aimed to be the script inputs. The issue
was that sometimes Cacti was executing the scripts at the exact same
time as wget, so sometimes they were not producing any data. I solved
this by using a temporary file and delaying the download process by some
seconds. The two crontab entries are:\
\
\* \* \* \* \* sleep 30; wget -O /home/user/bin/tmp.xml
<http://ipaddress:8090/Network.xml> \> /home/user/log/yacy\_wget.log
2\>&1; mv /home/user/bin/tmp.xml /home/user/bin/Network.xml\
\* \* \* \* \* sleep 30; curl -o /home/user/bin/tmp1.xml -u
admin:password <http://ipaddress:8090/PerformanceMemory_p.xml> \>
/home/user/log/yacy\_curl.log 2\>&1; mv /home/user/bin/tmp1.xml
/home/user/bin/PerformanceMemory\_p.xml\
\
(you may want to customize user, ipaddress and password to your linux
user, server ip and yacy admin password, respectively)\
\
The scrips run every minute to be in sync with Cacti polling interval,
which, in my case, is a 1 minute interval.
