> Diamagnetic Micro Manipulation (DM3) uses tiny magnets that move under
> a circuit board, to get the micro-robots to follow a set pattern based
> on a set of preprogrammed instructions. The system can be set up so
> just one or a couple of robots are working together, or you can have
> giant groups of them moving together in sync like some bizarre
> gymnastics routine. Despite their tiny size, the robots can move up to
> a foot in a single second, so they can haul around your micro
> manufacturing supplies pretty swiftly.
>
> SRI says that DM3 can be used for prototyping parts, electronics
> assembly, biotech lab-on-a-chip experiments, and assembling small
> mechanical systems in hostile environments. Eventually they plan to
> scale up the technology, by developing a manufacturing head containing
> thousands of the little buggers that can build much larger assemblies.
