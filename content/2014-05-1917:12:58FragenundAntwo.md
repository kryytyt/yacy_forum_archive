Hello Guims,\
\
the optimization starts after all crawls finished and your machine ist
idle.\
The optimization causes load on your machine, thats why other tasks are
paused.\
The optimization merges the URLs to one Segment / 5M URLs.\
So it looks ok to me.\
\
But I wonder that you\'ve 85GB for 8.5 M URLs. This means te index gets
merged to a singe Segment of 85GB.\
This will take a long time!\
\
\@all: What is the diskusage of the Solr-direktory at which count of
URLs?\
(I\'ve 60GB / 41 M URLs)\
\
\@Orbiter: perhaps we have to change the count of Segments / URLs on
optimization.\
