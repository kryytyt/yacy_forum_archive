> In the wake of an Uber driver arrested after allegedly hitting and
> injuring a cyclist in Fisherman\'s Wharf on Sunday, more questions are
> being raised about driver safety requirements.
>
> Specifically, taxis are regulated by SFMTA and are required to take 28
> hours of classes through one of four approved private driving schools,
> and another day of training through the SFMTA. An hour of the SFMTA
> training includes instruction on sharing the road with bicyclists and
> pedestrians, is taught by a member of the San Francisco Bicycle
> Coalition. At least two hours of testing is required. And as part of
> the city\'s Vision Zero plan, which aims to eliminate traffic deaths
> by 2024, SFMTA is instituting a large vehicle urban driving safety
> program for all large vehicle drivers who work for the city.
>
> All told, as Central City Extra covered in their latest issue, there
> are 71 pages of dense regulations for cab drivers to follow. Not so
> for drivers working for Uber, Lyft, Sidecar or limo companies, which
> are not regulated by the SFMTA \-- they only have 28 simple
> regulations to follow. \[\...\]
>
> Frisbee confirmed that the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition is in talks
> with Lyft to include online safety training. What about Uber? \"At
> this point, Uber has decided that our safety training is not worth
> their investment,\" Frisbee said. She said Uber told the San Francisco
> Bicycle Coalition the company \"found someone else to do it,\" but
> when it asked for details, including who was giving the training, how
> long it lasted and what was included, \"they said \'we\'re not sharing
> it\',\" she said.
