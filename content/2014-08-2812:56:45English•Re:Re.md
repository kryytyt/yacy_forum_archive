\'entries for that page that had existed before\': this has two
aspects:\
- Documents in Solr are simply overwritten\
- the p2p index references stay. If they cause that a web page is
considered as search hit but the search word does not then appear on the
page any more, the rwi entry is removed (that happens during searches).
Words that are never searched stay forever.\

\
this has also two faces: the \'index reference\' now means that the Solr
document is deleted. But the words in the rwi index stay and point now
to a document that do not exist any more. If they are for further
searches found because someone searched the word, they are deleted
whenever no reference can be found.
