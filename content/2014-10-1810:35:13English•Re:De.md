Are the 4 times uniformly distributed over the 64 tries? What is the
over-all time of the 64 tries?\
The Random-List works in this way: there are two small Lists (one for
IPv4 and one for IPv6) and every first \"working\" IPv4-Address and
every first \"working\" IPv6-Address of each running Peer is inserted in
this Lists (each List has a cycling Write-Pointer), then you call the
\'/forward?random\' Servlet it selects per random one of the
IP-Addresses (the List is selected by the IP-Version of the incoming
HTTP-Request, my Server is fully dual stacked) and returns a
HTTP-307-Redirect.\

I can add a test for the response-time of the complete transfer of the
entire Seed-List and only use Peers for the Random-List that send their
Seed-List in lesser than 3 seconds. Is this okay?\
But this is a trade-off between a wide variety of Peers and a selection
for \"high-quality\" Peers. Is in your opinion the load-time of the
majority of Peers fast enough?\
What was the symptom of the one \"dead\" Peer?\
My random List is filled only with IP-Addresses that are positive tested
within the last approximately 30 seconds. But i must say 1 fail on 64
tries is a good result for a distributed system that contains mostly
Peers on private Home-Computers.\

You mean an opt-in? I think this is the opposite of the goal of my
current random Selection.\
I would prefer a list with \"special announced\" YaCy-Peers on yacy.net,
this List can be a List of Links as

Code: 
:   `<a href="http://130.255.73.69:5353/forward?name=Peer-Name">Peer-Name</a>`

The Forwarder for Peer-Names and Peer-Hashs is present in my Tool but do
not work correctly, in the Source-Code this problem is well fixed but i
will finish an other important Feature prior to updating my Tool on the
Server.\

Greetings\
