=========================================

[Zoe Keating made a blog
post](http://zoekeating.tumblr.com/post/108898194009/what-should-i-do-about-youtube)
about what Google told her about the upcoming Youtube music streaming
service. Her post is a little confusing, so I\'ll try to summarize.

How it worked before:

-   She\'s her own label, and owns the copyright / publishing rights on
    her own songs.
-   She registered her songs with Youtube, saying \"these are mine\".
    (That\'s different than posting the songs publicly.)
-   Because of that, when someone else uploads a Youtube video that uses
    her music as the soundtrack, she\'s the one who receives the
    Content-ID notification.
-   She then gets the choice to block that video, or to run ads on it.
-   She generally chooses the latter, which means she gets 1/3 of the
    revenue generated by the ads on the video that has her music in it,
    and gets her name on the page.

So now Youtube is about to launch a new paid streaming service. If I\'m
understanding her post correctly, it goes like this:

-   Participation in the new service requires that your *entire* catalog
    be available for streaming, at high resolution.
-   Participation requires that you not release your music elsewhere
    earlier, e.g., no early releases for fans or backers.
-   You no longer get a choice of whether to do nothing, block a video,
    or run ads. Ads are mandatory.
-   Five year contract.
-   If you don\'t participate in the new service, then the option to
    obtain Content-ID ad revenue from the free version of Youtube no
    longer exists.
-   If you had previously been getting Content-ID ad revenue and choose
    not to participate in the new service, your channel will be deleted
    and all videos using your music will be blocked.

This means that, for all of those people who were making a little money
off of their music by letting Google run ads on it, the options now on
the table are:

1.  Agree to all the terms of the new service, including publishing your
    entire catalog on it, and continue making money on ads;
2.  Block all the videos using your music (and have your channel
    deleted);
3.  Allow those videos to use your music for free (and have your channel
    deleted).

It\'s another bait-and-switch: \"We had been paying you for your work
for years, under these terms. But now we have altered the agreement.
Pray we do not alter it further.\"

This sounds like Google using the same strategy they used with Google
Plus: instead of creating a new service and letting it compete on its
own merits, they\'re going to artificially prop it up by giving people
no choice but to sign up for it. Except in this case the people being
strong-armed are the copyright holders instead of the end users. (So
far, that is! Wait for it.)

I think you can expect to see a *lot* of old videos on Youtube getting
blocked in the near future because of this.
