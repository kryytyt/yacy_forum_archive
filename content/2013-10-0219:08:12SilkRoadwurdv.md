[Silk Road wurd
v&](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/02/crime-silkroad-raid-idUSL1N0HS12C20131002).

Update:

> It looks like they sniffed him \[Dread Pirate Roberts\] out by looking
> back at old Internet records (forum posts, IPs etc) from around the
> time of SRs appearance. The first person to ever advertise SR was DPR
> himself, and he used an email account attached to his natural born
> identity. No NSA or technical hack.

Anderes Highlight:

> EDIT: I just read [the complaint](http://i.imgur.com/FlFIIe8.png).
> Looks like he \[Dread Pirate Roberts\] actually tried to hire a hitman
> to have someone killed who was threatening to blackmail him. If so,
> the guy is an asshole and not a hero.\
> \
> EDIT2: Looks like the blackmailer and hitmen were trolling SR and got
> 1,700 BTC out of him. The blackmailer realized he wasn\'t going to get
> anything out of SR, so he came up with the brilliant idea of offering
> to \'off\' himself and it worked.

Noch mehr:

> DPR sent a message to \"redandwhite\" stating that \"FriendlyChemist\"
> is \"Causing me problems\" and adding: \"I would like to put a bounty
> on his head if it\'s not too much trouble for you. What would be an
> adequate amount to motivate you to find him?\"\
> \
> Later that same day, redandwhite sent DPR a message quoting him a
> price of \$150,000 or \$300,000 \"depending on how you want it done\"
> - \"clean\" or \"non-clean\"\
> \
> DPR responded: \"Don\'t want to be a pain here, but the price seems
> high. Not long ago, I had a clean hit done for \$80k. Are the prices
> you quoted the best you can do? I would like this done ASAP as he is
> talking about releasing the info on Monday.\
> \
> DPR and redandwhite agreed upon a price of 1,670 Bitcoins -
> approximately \$150k - for the job. In DPR\'s message confirming the
> deal, DPR included a transacation record reflecting the transfer of
> 1,670 Bitcoins to a certain Bitcoin address.
