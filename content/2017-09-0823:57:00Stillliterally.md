> Putin\'s propaganda farm bought around \$150,000 in political ads from
> at least June 2015 - May 2017; Facebook was compelled to share the
> information and will be cooperating with ongoing investigations into
> Russian interference in the 2016 election. The troll farm in question
> is the Internet Research Agency, a well-funded, well-established,
> nimble, English-speaking pro-Putin propaganda unit, and the ads are in
> all likelihood illegal. \[\...\]
>
> The total money spent (that Facebook would admit to) was allegedly
> responsible for around 3,000 ads with the potential to reach millions
> of people. Facebook isn\'t saying how many people *actually* saw them.
>
> There were an additional 2,200 ads Facebook said it suspected were
> also Russia backed; the company has avoided making a positive
> statement. It\'s arguable that the world\'s biggest surveillance
> platform has the data to connect the dots; it simply isn\'t doing so
> for this problem. \[\...\]
>
> The language that Facebook \"discovered\" this is disingenuous. As if
> it had no way of monitoring its ad program, and a Russian troll farm
> blasting propaganda was akin to finding a coin purse someone left
> under a cushion. Whoa! Who knew, or had any way of knowing? Well,
> Facebook did.
>
> Pretending otherwise is fool\'s errand; no one could be that
> incompetent at running advertising and metrics and simultaneously have
> the entire industry in a choke-hold. \[\...\]
>
> Facebook\'s minimizing of the problem, and pretending it\'s now fixed
> \-- by deleting a few fake accounts \-- is like minimizing gangrene.
> As if the accounts belonging to Putin\'s Internet Research Agency are
> a just tiny speck of bad actors and now they\'re gone, so phew, rest
> easy everyone.
