``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
added new field "place_context" which may hold two different values:
either "FROM" if the tweet was composed at the place, given in
"place_name"; or "ABOUT" if the coordinates in "location_point" was
computed using lookup from the text context.

When selecting a location with the /location constraint, now by default
only places with the attribute "place_context"="FROM" are selected. To
get only places with "place_context"="ABOUT", a new "/about" was
introduced.
```
