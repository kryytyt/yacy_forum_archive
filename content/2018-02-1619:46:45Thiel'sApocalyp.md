What I assume the cover of *The Sovereign Individual* looks like.

> Thiel is in one sense a caricature of outsized villainy: he was the

> didn\'t like how they wrote about him; he is known for his public
> musings about the incompatibility of freedom and democracy, and for

> clunkiest possible metaphor for capitalism at its most vampiric \-- in

> potential means of reversing the ageing process. But in another,
> deeper sense, he is pure symbol: less a person than a shell company
> for a diversified portfolio of anxieties about the future, a human
> emblem of the moral vortex at the centre of the market. \[\...\]

> If I wanted to understand the extreme ideology that underpinned
> Thiel\'s attraction to New Zealand, he insisted, I needed to
> understand an obscure libertarian manifesto called *The Sovereign
> Individual: How to Survive and Thrive During the Collapse of the
> Welfare State.* It was published in 1997, and in recent years
> something of a minor cult has grown up around it in the tech world,

> The book\'s 400-odd pages of near-hysterical orotundity can roughly be

> 1\) The democratic nation-state basically operates like a criminal
> cartel, forcing honest citizens to surrender large portions of their
> wealth to pay for stuff like roads and hospitals and schools.
>
> 2\) The rise of the internet, and the advent of cryptocurrencies, will
> make it impossible for governments to intervene in private transactions
> and to tax incomes, thereby liberating individuals from the political
> protection racket of democracy.
>
> 3\) The state will consequently become obsolete as a political entity.
>
> 4\) Out of this wreckage will emerge a new global dispensation, in which
> a \"cognitive elite\" will rise to power and influence, as a class of
> sovereign individuals \"commanding vastly greater resources\" who will
> no longer be subject to the power of nation-states and will redesign
> governments to suit their ends.
