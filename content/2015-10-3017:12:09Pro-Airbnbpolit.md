> For every one minute of political ads aired in favor of a contentious

> area TV stations \[\...\]
>
> The Internet Archive found just one TV ad favoring the initiative,
> also appeared on the Proposition F campaign website. The Archive
> discovered 32 instances of this ad airing on local TV stations, for a
> total of 16 minutes of airplay. \[\...\] In contrast, in our sample
> range, Airbnb supporters aired more than 26 hours of ads against the
> initiative. \[\...\]

> Over all, according to reports filed with the San Francisco Ethics
> Commission, opponents of Proposition F have reported spending \$6.5
