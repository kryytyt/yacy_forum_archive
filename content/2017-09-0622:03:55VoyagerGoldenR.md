My [V\'Ger
swag](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ozmarecords/voyager-golden-record-40th-anniversary-edition)
has arrived, and it\'s gorgeous! The book and all the various bits and
pieces are really cool. It also comes with a sweet slip mat.

I was a little disappointed that the audio download didn\'t come with
the digitally encoded images, because I don\'t actually own a record
player (shut up) but fortunately it\'s on
[Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-482195982/voyager-golden-record-encoded-images).
([direct
download](https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/340960194/stream?client_id=a3e059563d7fd3372b49b37f00a00bcf)).

[Here\'s a fun story about figuring out how to decode the
images:](https://boingboing.net/2017/09/05/how-to-decode-the-images-on-th.html)

The files he was able to extract are all

I\'m pretty sure some of these pictures violate the Terms of Service on
Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
