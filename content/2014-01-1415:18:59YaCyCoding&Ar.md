YaCy Coding & Architektur â€¢ Can a YaCy-owned IPv6 subnet solve the port forwading issue?
========================================================================================

Because this topic may influence the VM-Image-with-YaCy and YaCyPi
project I post this in english:\
\
You can have a (large!) IPv6 subnet at <https://www.sixxs.net>. This
means: when you sign up there, you become a network operator with a very
large IP range and you can assign fixed IPv6 numbers to your devices.
Because such devices are tunneled through your router (or whatever) they
become directly visible in the IPv6 internet and all your open ports on
your server as well.\
\
This is the easiest solution to the router-port-forwarding problem when
we need to forward ports from peers which shall be easy-to-set-up.\
\
But: each VM or device must get assigned a single IP within that IP
range that you get from sixxs.
