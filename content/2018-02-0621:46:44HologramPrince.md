> **GW:** With digital editing, it is now possible to create a situation
> where you could jam with any artist from the past. Would you ever
> consider doing something like that?
>
> **0{+\> :** Certainly not. That\'s the most demonic thing imaginable.
>
> Everything is as it is, and it should be. If I was meant to jam with
> Duke Ellington, we would have lived in the same age. That whole
> virtual reality thing\... it really is demonic. And I am not a demon.
> Also, what they did with that Beatles song \[\"Free As a Bird\"\],
> manipulating John Lennon\'s voice to have him singing from across the
> grave\... that\'ll never happen to me.
>
> To prevent that kind of thing from happening is another reason why I
> want artistic control.
