Had 2 new installs giving Error 403 proxy use not allowed when
connecting externally.\
I went to the page /Settings\_p.html?page=ServerAccess and entered my
external IP Address, Problem fixed.\
\
Settings Receipt:\
\
Your server access filter is now set to \*\
\
Also from status page\
Proxy\
Transparent off URL off\
\
In yacy.conf is the serverClient=\* setting what you have to change?\
\
I tried the hosts file yesterday but no luck, It still may need it
though.
