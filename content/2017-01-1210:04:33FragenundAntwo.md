Hello,\
the message can also originate a few lines
[upper](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/c1401d821e2141fd3d1e1a1ec03ec8b20f8fcd86/source/net/yacy/crawler/CrawlStacker.java#L495){.postlink}
when you use the \"Load Filter on URLs\" filter on the
/CrawlStartExpert.html page.\
\
Indeed I just checked and had no problem with your regular expression
filter. I used

Code: 
:   `(smb|ftp|https?)://(www.)?(\Qen.wikipedia.org\E.*)`

as a \"must-match\" \"Load Filter on URLs\" and used

Code: 
:   `"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page`

as start URL with a crawl depth set to 1:\
- URLs such as <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page> are
successfully rejected\
- URLs such as <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_12> are
successfully crawled\
\
Another example with <http://yacy.net> as start URL and

Code: 
:   `(smb|ftp|https?)://(www.)?(\Qyacy.net\E.*)`

as filter also worked as expected :\
- URLs such as <http://player.vimeo.com/video/102122237> are rejected\
- URLs such as <http://yacy.net/release_notes/> are successfully
crawled\
\
Did one of use missed something?
