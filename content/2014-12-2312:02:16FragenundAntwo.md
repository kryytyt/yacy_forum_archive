Thank you, i did some Tests:\
as first i have checked with commandline-tool \'wget\'

-   \"wget richtercloud.de:80/\" and \"wget 92.195.50.69:80/\" this was
    only for reference (with your regular HTTP-Server) and both worked
    successful
-   \"wget 92.195.50.69:8090/\" failed with HTTP-Error 403 from your
    YaCy-Peer
-   \"wget richtercloud.de:8090/\" successful Response from your
    YaCy-Peer
-   \"wget \--header=\"Host: richtercloud.de:8090\" 92.195.50.69:8090/\"
    successful Response from your YaCy-Peer caused by correct
    HTTP-Host-Parameter
-   \"wget \--header=\"Host: 92.195.50.69:8090\" richtercloud.de:8090/\"
    failed with HTTP-Error 403 from your YaCy-Peer caused by
    [wrong]{style="font-style: italic"} HTTP-Host-Parameter (\"wrong\"
    means \"unknown\" by your YaCy-Peer)
-   \"wget \--header=\"Host: richtercloud.yacy:8090\"
    92.195.50.69:8090/\" successful Response from your YaCy-Peer caused
    by correct HTTP-Host-Parameter (the Peer-Name of your YaCy-Peer)

as next i have checked with webpagetest.org

-   for \"richtercloud.de:8090/\" :
    [http://www.webpagetest.org/result/14122 \...
    1/details/](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/141223_K1_F51/1/details/){.postlink}
    , for more details expand \"request 1\" at the bottom on this Page
-   for \"92.195.50.69:8090/\" :
    [http://www.webpagetest.org/result/14122 \...
    1/details/](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/141223_SZ_F89/1/details/){.postlink}
    , for more details expand \"request 1\" at the bottom on this Page

the only difference is the content of the Host-Parameter in the
HTTP-Request (you can see in both detailed views).\
\
yacy.info can not successful access your YaCy-Peer caused by the
403-HTTP-Response, sorry, there is nothing what i can do (except a
better (more descriptive) Error-Text, i do work on this).\
\
Your YaCy-Peer is reachable from outside but YaCy has a bug that cause
an invalid response, the inappropriate HTTP-Error 403, that prevent
successful access to the Peer.\
In this Forum we do talk about the HTTP-Error 403 since months, see
[viewtopic.php?&t=5165\#p31401](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?&t=5165#p31401){.postlink-local},
but without a satisfactory result. I have offered my help/support for
working on a bugfix multiple times, but without any reaction.\
\
\@Orbiter:\
This (the results from webpagetest.org) clearly proves the 403-Error is
[inside]{style="text-decoration: underline"} of YaCy!\

The Peer-Name must be a valid single DNS-Label, this means: only numbers
and letters and minus and underscore + length in range of 3\...63
characters\

For this i do not have an explanation, the bootstrapping of your Peer
may be failed.\
