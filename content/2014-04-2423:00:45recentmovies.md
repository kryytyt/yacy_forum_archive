[**CQ:**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0254199/) How did I not know about
this?? If *Barbarella* and *Danger: Diabolik* are among your favorite
movies of all time, you need to see this immediately. (If *Barbarella*
and *Danger: Diabolik* are *not* among your favorite movies of all time,
then we can\'t be friends.)

It\'s about people making a movie, *Secret Agent Codename Dragonfly,*
loaded with homages to the above, *which looks **amazing**,* so there\'s
that, but the framing story itself is also great. Lunar Marxists! John
Phillip Law! Billy Zane!

Mars:**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/559914737/the-veronica-mars-movie-project)
I kinda loved this, and I\'m kinda shocked by that, because there is not
a history of movie-sequels-to-tv-shows being any good. The *X Files*
movies sucked. The *Farscape* movies sucked. The *Dead Like Me* movie
sucked. The *Firefly* movie was mediocre at best.

Anyway, this one is great! It captured all the bad decision-making and
class-war fun of the series, with a dose of high-school-reunion hell on
top. The fan service feels more satisfying than pandering.
