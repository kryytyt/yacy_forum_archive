Please enjoy [jwz mixtape
140](http://www.dnalounge.com/webcast/mixtapes/). I felt like making an
audio-only mixtape this time. I haven\'t done that in five years.

This will self-destruct in two weeks.

If you open it in Safari, it\'s not seekable, but if you copy the URL
and open it in iTunes, it\'s seekable and has per-track metadata. (Which
I guess means that
[previously](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/01/itunes-and-streaming/) no
longer entirely true.)

Our irregularly programmed schedule will return next week.
