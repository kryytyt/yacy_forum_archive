English â€¢ Advice for running peer
=================================

Date: 2014-06-24 05:52:33

Hi,\
\
I just started running a peer on a remote dedicated server. What advice
would you give to do this most efficiently without exceeding the
bandwidth/storage limits of the hosting provider?\
\
I observed that the \"Sent DHT Word chunks\" and \"Sent URLs\" are zero
for my peer. Is this normal when doing heavy crawling? Do I need to
change any settings?\
\
Thanks.
