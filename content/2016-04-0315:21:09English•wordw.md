Hi,\
I\'d installed Yacy few days ago on a dedicated computer to participate
to freeworld network.\
I try to understand some Yacy features.\
One is about accentuated characters, that are many in french language.\
\
[Yacy does not found document on search with \"androïd\" while it find
some with search \"android\".]{style="font-weight: bold"} But it should
find same documents for those 2 searches \...\
\
Where this behavior (stemming or else) can be adjusted ?\
\
Thanks a lot.\
Cheers.
