YEAH great work! I did not yet work with OpenSCAD but I got your work
into a working stl.\
\
Can you add the star as well?\
\
Now I need to figure out to separate the blue from the white. You
computed the thick outline using the OpenSCAD methods which looks
exactly like the original... How Can I have a seperate stl for white and
blue?
