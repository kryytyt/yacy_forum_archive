English â€¢ Re: How to get YACY working as a proxy
================================================

Hello,\
\
3 days without any reaction, that makes me sad. Is for this problem
really nothing to write? Can anybody confirm or refute my observations
about the HTTP/Proxy-Problems in YaCy?\
In this forum we talk since more than 2 months about the 403-HTTP-Error
and it seems that the responsible developer do not have any analysis
(made by himself) about it.\
I offered my help for resolving problems on the IP-communication-level
multiple times, always without any reaction. There are many problems.\
\
Orbiter, the truth is, your
[non]{style="text-decoration: underline"}reaction is exactly the (by me)
expected reaction.\
The real reason for my sadness is the fact that YaCy is a very cool
project and the idea behind YaCy has a big potential. But without the
needed work on the basics (IP-communication is a basic engine for a
Peer-to-Peer-Search-Application) this project would die.\
\
Greetings\
Erik
