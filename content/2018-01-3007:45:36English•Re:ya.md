Hi SatSquash,\
some answers for you :\
1) to use your own TLS certificates, either self-signed or validated by
Let\'s Encrypt or any other Certificate Authority, the steps are
(shortly) described in English in the
[yacy.init](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/Release_1.92/defaults/yacy.init#L52){.postlink}
file as comments over the \"pkcs12ImportFile\" configuration key.\
\
2) as far as I know this is not currently possible to ensure there is no
clear-text http at all going out a YaCy peer\
\
3) but if you run from latest sources from GitHub or upgrade to the
lastest developer release (1.921/9513), you can now at least configure
your peer to prefer https over http when possible for peer-to-peer
search and for a part of the p2p operations. The related settings are
the \"Remote search encryption\" section in the Portal Configuration
page (/ConfigPortal\_p.html), and the
\"network.unit.protocol.https.preferred\" configuration key available in
the Advanced Config page (ConfigProperties\_p.html) or in your yacy.conf
file. This is still a work-in-progress, as initially all operations on
YaCy network were in http, eventually encoded, but not strongly
encrypted.\
\
4) about having a valid certificate for this forum, \@Orbiter is
probably the one who could answer you\
\
Have a nice day
