Yup, it happened again.\
\
I let the crawler run for about 14 hours, then I paused it before
shutting down the server. It didn\'t help and I got the same error
message:\
\

Code: 
:   `java.io.FileNotFoundException: /usr/share/yacy/DATA/INDEX/freeworld/QUEUES/CrawlerLimitStacks/toni.org-#gctLmQ.80/0003.stack (Too many open files)`

\
\
I moved the /INDEX/freeworld/QUEUES/ directory: the system started in no
time and the index seems to be safe.\
\
BTW, this is the size of QUEUES:\
\

Code: 
:   `root@amelia:/storage# ls -R QUEUES/| wc -l536442`

\
\
I\'ll try increasing the \"crawler.onDemandLimit\" value to 50000, any
suggestions on suitable values? Currently I assigned 64 GB of RAM to
Yacy, but I could bump it up to 96 GB.\
\
I\'m using the default Crawling depth of 3 for now, so that shouldn\'t
be the problem. I don\'t need to restart the server that often, but I\'m
experimenting to see if Yacy is a viable solution to the problems I\'m
having with my research project, so I need to know that I can rely on
it.\
\
Unfortunately, most of the documentation is is German and I don\'t speak
German, so I need to do a bit of trial and error and use Google
Translate\...

Thanks for your help Luc!
