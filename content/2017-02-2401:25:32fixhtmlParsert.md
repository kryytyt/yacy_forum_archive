fix htmlParser <script> text extraction on code containing expression
recognized as tag like 1<a
reported in https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/issues/109

Script content is ignored by default, but the text is filtered for html
tags. Modified scraper to skip tag filtering while within a <script> 
section (until a closing tag is detected </script>. 
Possible side effect, missing </script> end-tag will truncate trailing 
content text.
