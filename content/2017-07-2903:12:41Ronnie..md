I was biking home late one night and there was car stopped next to me at
a red light. The driver\'s window was open so I could hear her yelling
at the guy in the passenger seat as she stared straight ahead:

The light changed, I giggled and rode on. A block later I stopped at the
next light and looked back. The car had pulled over mid-block, both
doors were open, and she was on the sidewalk trying to physically drag
him out of the passenger seat.
