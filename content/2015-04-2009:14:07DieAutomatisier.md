[Die Automatisierung hat die Gefühlswelt
erreicht](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/opinion/sunday/the-machines-are-coming.html):

> A robot with emotion-detection software interviews visitors to the
> United States at the border. In field tests, this eerily named
> "embodied avatar kiosk" does much better than humans in catching those
> with invalid documentation. Emotional-processing software has gotten
> so good that ad companies are looking into "mood-targeted"
> advertising, and the government of Dubai wants to use it to scan all
> its closed-circuit TV feeds.
