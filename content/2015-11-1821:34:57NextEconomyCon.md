> From tennis lessons and stock reports to antiquing and booking a
> private jet, technology is transforming everything about the way we
> live
>
> Currently topping the leaderboard for whitest rich dude statement:
> \"My dogs get mani-pedis; I don\'t\". But it\'s a competitive field
>
> Next talk is a vision of connecting ubiquitous surveillance
> technologies to a form letter generator. \#nexteconomy
>
> GE CEO talking about how they\'re giving back to society by competing
> worldwide and spreading good-old American know-how
>
> GE CEO: it\'s imporant that we not live in a society where meaningful
> employment is precarious and limited to the lucky few. (just kidding)
>
> Sign of how broken US spirit is that we can have a panel talk on
> retail-level employment without anyone even imagining paid holiday
> leave
>
> Stage engulfed in sulfurous fumes as TaskRabbit founder materializes
> in the flaming on-stage pentagram. This is getting good \#nexteconomy
>
> Our chimney sweeps are allowed to keep and sell the creosote they
> scrape from their skin, making them small business owners!
>
> Now we have a cabbie, Uber driver, and Lyft driver. This is like
> discussing the Protestant reformation with Calvin, Luther and the Pope
>
> Discussion of whether you can refuse passengers based on their
> likelihood to puke actually a terrific analysis of driver agency and
> power
>
> Second-best part of conference is techies mansplaining on Twitter why
> working a 60 hour week as an underpaid driver is a great livelihood
>
> Cabbie (Kelly Dessaint) \"The worst drivers in SF are tourists, and
> most Uber and Lyft drivers are tourists. They live in Modesto,
> Hayward\...\"
>
> \
> VC is describing magical feeling of pressing button on his phone,
> getting food. Lab rats have been living this dream for years
>
> The trick is to not deliver the food every time the VC presses the
> button. Intermittent reward ensures a hefty series B
>
> \
> VCs now vehemently agreeing that the path to victory is pretend to be
> a service without incurring any of the obligations of one
>
> \"If your idea isn\'t big enough to warrant regulatory scrutiny, it
> probably isn\'t important enough.\" This is the mentality of a toddler
>
> We\'re moving from a world of widespread unemployment to one where
> people have three, four or even five jobs. \#prosperity
>
> The BART system is a dinosaur monopoly that should be deregulated so
> private trains can run on it, too
>
> Only at a San Francisco tech conference do you have to mount a basic
> defense of the concept of government before proposing modest
> regulation
>
> Really nice to be hearing a VC getting worked up over low wages and
> social cohesion instead of immortality and greening Mars
>
> \"Trickle-down economics is an intimidation tactic masquerading as
> economic theory.\" Best VC ever. Last against the wall.
>
> \
> Fire alarm. Huge victory for the working class
>
> O\'Reilly and Hoffman on stage trying to deduce from first principles
> whether fire alarm is real or can be safely ignored
>
> Any journalist looking for the world\'s easiest metaphor should get in
> here ASAP
>
> I never thought I would live to hear Tim O\'Reilly say \"I\'m sorry
> for the disruption\". But the heroic hotel fire alarm made it happen
>
> \
> Recurring theme this morning is Minimum Viable Education, how to train
> future tech professionals without the baggage of reading English lit
>
> Counterintuitively, grinding up the top 10% of employees and feeding
> them to the bottom 10% actually works better than the old way
>
> \"If the Soviets had proposed current US economic policy, we would
> have sent the USS Iowa to the Baltic Sea\"
>
> \
> Lyft guy spent three years on public transit board in LA. \$2 bus fare
> covers 30% of the ride, rest comes from subsidies, which are dying
>
> Paraphrasing him, \"how do we make Los Angeles more like Botswana?\".
> So many people traveling abroad have been struck by maxi-taxis market
>
> Based on my experiences in collective taxis in Moldova, there\'s a
> huge synergy with reconstructive dentistry
>
> \
> \"Why is it that I always get the whole person when I want the pair of
> hands?\" - Henry Ford. Back when the US knew how to manufacture
> villains
>
> Now Ev is talking about his investment in a diamond manufacturer, and
> next-generation fake meat
>
> We\'re high above the atmosphere now talking about abstractions. I
> have no idea what anyone is saying.
>
> \"Who are the people you want your customers to become?\" is such an
> American phrase it might as well have little flags flying out of it
