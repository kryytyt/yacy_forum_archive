Added utility class CreateTranslationMasters to create a language independant
translation master as source to harmonize individual translation files
Included a main to create masters in YaCy an xliff format for testing

P.S. used https://open-language-tools.java.net/editor/about-xliff-editor.html to
experiement with xlf output (haven't a Pootle avail.)
