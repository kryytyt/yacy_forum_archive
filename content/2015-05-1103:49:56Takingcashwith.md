Taking cash with a Mac
======================

Lazyweb, let me ask a more specific [photo
booth](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/04/photo-booth/)-related question:

Let\'s say you have two devices, a Mac Mini and a black box that has a
cash-input slot and a credit card reader.

1.  What is the make and model of that black box?
2.  How does software running on that Mac have the dialog:\
    \"Dear user, give me two dollars now\" â†’\
    \"Oh, I see that you have, hooray.\"

I have done a bit of searching on said black boxes, and there are many
of them, but I can\'t determine what the interface to any of them is,
whether it\'s \"pin goes +5v\" or what. Something less caveman than that
would be nice, obviously.
