Updated the generic top-level known domains list.

Using current IANA reference list at
https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db

The generated URL hashes on these domains stay the same but performance
is greatly improved as a DNS resolve request is required on URL hash
computation when the TLD part of the host name is unknown.

Hash computation mean time measured on 1541 sample URLs (one on each
TLD) and a computer with a DSL connection : about 230ms before change,
then only 20ms.
