[This Couple Is Raising \$1 Million to Fund Medical-Grade MDMA and
Mushrooms](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-couple-is-raising-1-million-to-fund-medical-grade-mdma-and-mushrooms)

> Altogether, Krebs and Johansen are looking to raise \$1 million. Once
> they reach \$300,000, they will start the process of manufacturing
> psilocybin. Another \$300,000 will allow them to produce MDMA. The
> remaining \$400,000 will support their efforts to decriminalize and
> reduce harm around MDMA and psychedelic use. \[\...\]
>
> Once the manufacturing process is up and going, EmmaSofia will sell
> high-quality, \"reasonably priced\" psilocybin and MDMA to authorized
> parties, said Johansen.
>
> EmmaSofia also plans to distribute free psilocybin and MDMA to
> [Indiegogo
> donors](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mdma-psychedelics-to-the-world-round-2)
> based on how much money they gave. In order to receive the drugs,
> however, donors would have to secure legal permission from their home
> country \-- a process that, realistically, will probably only be
> feasible for a limited number of people.
