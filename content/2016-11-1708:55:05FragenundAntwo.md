I didn\'t change the config, I had a look and it only used the default
settings, i.e. NRTCachingDirectoryFactory - the link you provided says
\" solr.StandardDirectoryFactory is filesystem\
based and tries to pick the best implementation for the current\
JVM and platform. solr.NRTCachingDirectoryFactory, the default,\
wraps solr.StandardDirectoryFactory and caches small files in memory\
for better NRT performance.\
\"\
so instead of letting solr pick it\'s implementations (it looks like it
picked solr.NIOFSDirectoryFactory which as you says, seems to have
problems on my PI) I just did set it to solr.SimpleFSDirectoryFactory
and it works without exceptions. Will try to set it to the other option
available solr.MMapDirectoryFactory, which should be a little more
performant. THANKS for the help.
