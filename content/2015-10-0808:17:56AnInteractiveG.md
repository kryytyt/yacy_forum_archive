> As a thought experiment, let\'s examine in extremely close detail a
> set of iterative changes that can be made to a single simple
> grammatical structure, turning it from a statement taken at face value
> into one loaded with unrealized implication. This makes for rich
> writing which rewards \-- or even demands \-- close scrutiny. \[\...\]
>
> The verb is still concrete, but it shouldn\'t be. In fact, the verb
> can be removed completely: convert it into a present participle
> adjective, and then use that participle as a modifier for a broad,
> general-purpose noun. In this example we\'ll use \"incident\" to at
> least acknowledge that the events took place along a common timeline,
> but even that much is still an unnecessary concession to specificity
> \-- we could just as easily substitute \"thing,\" which is so broad
> that unpacking it will command the reader\'s complete attention.
>
> In addition, there is still a distinction between the subject and
> object which can be further erased. Both subject and object were
> \"involved\" in the proceedings, simply because both are present in
> the sentence. That new verb can apply to both nouns, making them equal
> and indistinguishable partners.
