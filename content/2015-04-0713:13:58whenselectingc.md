``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
when selecting collections in navigation, do show the un-selected
collections in search result. When selecting one of them in another
search, switch off the previously selected collection. This actually
turns the collection navigation modifier into a radio-button like
behaviour
```
