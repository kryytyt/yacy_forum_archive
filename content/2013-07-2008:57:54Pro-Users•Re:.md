Pro-Users â€¢ Re: A Peer To Peer Web Directory To Go With YACY
============================================================

Hi Bungeebones,\
\
I endorse David\'s opinion. YaCy\'s concept is a noncommercial
peer-to-peer network. Your proposal to combine Yacy with a central
server sounds nice, but is in contradiction to YaCy being a distributed,
uncensored search-engine. Also, a central node in a network always is a
weak point regarding its vulnerability.\
\
Finally, those people who want to be served by a big central
search-engine should stay with Google.\
\
Just my opinion\
