Thank you, Eric S.\
\
I tried the two sites, and I think I see part of the problem\...\
\
(First, I\'m not sure how I would test the ports on webpagetest\...)\
\
The IP addresses in my router settings and on canyouseeme and yacy are
different. The one on my router is called \"internal IP.\" When I tried
to change my router settings to match the IP address on the websites, It
said \"Server IP address must be a LAN IP address\" and changed it back
to the original IP.\
\
On canyouseeme.org, it does not let me change the IP address. When I
enter the ports I opened on my router, it says it can not see it my
service.\
\
On the Yacy test site, when I enter my internal IP, nd ports it says
\"Get Not global Unicast-IP-Address.\"\
\
If I enter the IP it says I have, (which is the same one canyouseeme.org
thinks I have) it waits for a while, and then says \"No valid Yacy peer
found.\"
