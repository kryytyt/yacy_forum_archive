[I think the squid market is my favorite part. The whole thing is pretty
amazing, though.](http://www.ottgallery.com/WelcometoArkham.html)

> There\'s still a squid auction at the Obed Marsh warehouse every
> Thursday, and occasionally one can still see a big squid like in the
> old days, like this prize 27-foot *Architeuthis* just hauled up from
> Innsmouth. After the auction, it will be cut up and rendered in the
> trypots for squid oil.
>
> Behind the Starry Wisdom Church, in the shadow of the Peabody Avenue
> Bridge, is another Arkham landmark \-- the Old Squid Market. Arkham\'s
> once-thriving squid fishery at the mouth of the Miskatonic has
> declined, but there are still some squid fishers over in Innsmouth.
> Nowadays, the narrow alley is mostly a fish market for the local
> housewives, though fresh squid, pickled squid, barrels of squid oil,
> and casks of ink can still be readily found. \[\...\]
>
> Across Garrison, the Bensalem Building hosts a variety of enterprises.
> The mesmerists, Drs. Nikola and Mabuse, have set up shop selling
> questionable cures and \"rubber goods.\" One of the shady mesmerists
> can be seen with a female patient in the bay window, doubtlessly
> trying to convince the young woman how theraputic it would be to
> reveal the combination to her husband\'s wall safe. \[\...\]
>
> Up on the roof, Professor Pickering has his private observatory. Prof.
> Pickering is famous for having confirmed the sighting of those flashes
> on Mars a few years back. These days, he\'s searching for a ninth,
> trans-Neptunian, planet \-- which he calls Yuggoth, for some reason
> \-- which he\'s sure is there.
