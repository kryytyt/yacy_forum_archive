[Wenn man bei Tor mal ein bisschen näher
hinguckt](https://nymity.ch/anomalous-tor-keys/), findet man sowas hier:

> Our experiments revealed that ten relays shared moduli, and 3,557
> relays---most part of a research project---shared prime factors,
> allowing adversaries to reconstruct private keys. We further
> discovered 122 relays that used non-standard RSA exponents, presumably
> in an attempt to attack onion services. By simulating how onion
> services are positioned in Tor's distributed hash table, we could
> identify four onion services that were likely targeted by these
> malicious relays.
