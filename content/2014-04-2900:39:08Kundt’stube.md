[Sealed Tube Speaker System Shows off Standing Waves sans Fire,
Mess](http://makezine.com/2014/04/27/sealed-tube-speaker-system-shows-off-standing-waves-sans-fire-mess/)

> Kundt\'s tube is one of several classic acoustics instruments used
> originally to measure, and now mostly to demonstrate, phenomena
> related to standing waves. Unlike Ruben\'s tube (which uses open flame
> and requires a source of combustible fuel) or a Chladni plate (which
> uses loose fine powder) to create similar effects, Kundt\'s tube is
> both completely safe and completely clean.
>
> The example shown here was built by San Luis Obispo resident and
> nuclear engineer Mike Sullivan. It consists of a clear tube with a
> speaker at each end containing hundreds of fluorescent plastic beads.
> The speakers produce two different pitches \-- one (to left) fixed at
> A220, and one (to right) that can be varied over a range of about a
> half-step up or down from A220 by turning the single knob.
