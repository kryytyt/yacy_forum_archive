[Pixium Vision has received the approval to begin in-human trials of a
miniature wireless sub-retinal
implant.](https://hackaday.com/2017/11/07/bionic-eye-trial-approved/)

> The PRIMA implant is a photovoltaic chip about 2mm square and only 30
> microns thick. That\'s tiny, but the device has 378 electrodes. The
> patient uses a device that looks like a conventional pair of glasses
> but contains an integrated camera that sends data wirelessly to a
> small pocket-sized image processing computer. This computer then
> commands the glasses to send data to the implant via invisible
> infrared light. The chip converts the light to electrical impulses and
> conducts them to the optic nerve.
