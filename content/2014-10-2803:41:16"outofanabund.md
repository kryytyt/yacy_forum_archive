> cancelled Sunday when a passenger\'s phone picked up the Wi-Fi signal
> \"al-Quida Free Terror Nettwork\" (sic) that was emanating from a
> fellow flier\'s hotspot minutes before the United Airlines flight was
> set to liftoff.

> After a concerned passenger notified a flight attendant of the network
> at about 9:30pm, the plane taxied to a remote section of the Los
> Angeles airport and was held there for three hours. The plane was
> searched as passengers of Flight 136 were ordered to power off
> electronic devices, local media said.
