Hi, thats a very interesting proposal!\
\
Thats a very useful use of YaCy as a \'laboratory\' for \'social
search\' & ranking research. Since that approach will come up with a set
of ranking rules for YaCy, it will be very useful for us.\
\
This reminds me that the documentation for the YaCy ranking mechanism is
(still) very incomplete, so please use the opportunity to ask questions
about it, I will do my best to write a documentation in the wiki to
answer your questions.\
\
I would like to add another reference for this idea: the french seeks
project, now moved to <https://github.com/beniz/seeks>\
Short about seeks: its a framework above of other search engines which
applies \'social ranking rules\' using the clicks on search results.
They claim that they solved the problem to anonymously distribute the
clicks on the results to main privacy of the users. I got this explained
by the project maintainer, Emmanuel Benazera, in personal discussion,
and it made pretty much sense. I hope there is some documentation
visible about his approach, if you cannot find that then just ask
him\...\
\
I would like to mention that we actually have an upvote/downvote
mechanism at the search results which is not very much used; just a hint
that there is already some framework that you could use. Please consider
that you may get your hands on the code for that

However, if you need something, just post here.
