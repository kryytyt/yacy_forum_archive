Please, take note that this is not a comprehensive step-by-step guide.\
\
It assumes you already have a Cacti installation up and running and the
minimum knowledge on Cacti as well as on basic Linux permissions
concepts (specially required when installing Cacti).\
\
(Take your time to learn a bit about those; it will save time later)\
\
Cacti installation can be a little tricky, but once installed, [it runs
smoothly and is very stable]{style="font-weight: bold"} (mine is running
for almost a year without issues).\
\
Also take note that you can change the graphs templates that come within
the host template tar (to be imported in Cacti) after you created graphs
based on them, but if you don\'t want to loose previous data, you have
to restrict them to cosmetics (color, type of graph - line, area,
stack\... - and the many check-boxes at bottom). If you add or remove
any data input attribute, the graphs created from that template will
stop graphing. You should delete and recreate them (the graphs, not the
template).
