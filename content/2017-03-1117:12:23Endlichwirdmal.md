> Gottlieb is well known on Capitol Hill, where he has testified
> multiple times on hot-button health issues, including complex drug
> pricing matters, and is viewed favorably by drug companies and

Oh, warte...

Wobei, hier ist der andere Kandidat:

> Gottlieb was chosen over Jim O\'Neill, a libertarian investor close to
> Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder who now
> advises Trump on technology and science matters. O\'Neill\'s stated
> view that drugs should be approved before being proven effective
> generated widespread alarm.
