English â€¢ YaCy Mac 1.82 won\'t launch on Mac OSX 10.0.1 Java 8u31
=================================================================

Date: 2015-01-23 15:42:43

I\'m trying to run YaCy for the first time. I have Mac OSX 10.0.1 and
Java 8 update 31 I get this error message on first launch.\
\
\"To view this web content, you need to install the Java Runtime
Environment.\"\
\
It would be very helpful to have the instructions to get this working
included in a tutorial. I am unable to add \"localhost:8090/index.html\"
to my site exceptions list because Java forbids me. I don\'t know what
other Java settings I might change to allow YaCy to run. Can someone
please help me? I\'m sure there are many other Mac users that will have
this same issue. Thank you all very much.
