Fragen und Antworten • Site count and indexed sites
===================================================

Hi,\
\
Two questions, one easy and one perhaps not so easy:\
\
1. Is there a way to get a count of sites/domains in the index? I notice
<http://localhost:8090/api/status_p.html> nor .xml lists such a stat.\
\
2. I seem to max out at 2,530 sites in the index. When dumping out all
sites from hostbrowser.html or .xml, I only ever see 2,530
sites/domains. I request this url,
\"http://localhost:8090/HostBrowser.xml?admin=true&hosts=\" which should
dump all sites in the index. Once I noticed this, I created 50 new
vhost1.example.com, vhost2.example.com, etc all with a single html page
serving up \"this is vhost \#\". These sites are crawled, but not
showing up in the hostbrowser.xml site dump. Am I doing something wrong
or misunderstanding what should be in the index?\
\
I\'ve started looking at the solr engine directly to see if there is
something there to get me a feel for what\'s in the index.\
\
Thank you for any pointers.
