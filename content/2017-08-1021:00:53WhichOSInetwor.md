[Malware in a Strand of
DNA](https://www.wired.com/story/malware-dna-hack/)

This next part makes me sad. By \"verge on cheating\" you mean
\"absolutely totally cheating\":

> Despite that tortuous, unreliable process, the researchers admit, they

> program\'s open-source code to insert their own flaw allowing the
> buffer overflow.

Still, it\'s a great stunt. [Original paper

My favorite line is \"The repeated `0xdeadbeef` bytes produced a long
(40+ base pair) repetitive sequence\" because it makes me wonder whether
this DNA is technically dead, and/or beef.
