Geo-IP, again
=============

If you work at Youtube, can you tell me what country the system thinks
`199.48.144.20` is in?

Bonus points if you can tell me how to fix it.

I\'ve wrestled with this before and still haven\'t figured it out, years
later.

The answer is not `"US"`, even though that is the case. Here\'s a video
that it won\'t let me view from that IP, with the error \"The uploader
has not made this video available in your country\":
[7KzK-1M3QjE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KzK-1M3QjE).

And here\'s what the API says about that video\'s restrictions:

From comparing that list to the list of all country codes, I can infer
that Youtube thinks I\'m in: `"AC"`, `"AN"`, `"CW"`, `"DE"`, `"EU"`,
`"SU"`, `"SX"`, `"TP",` or `"UK"` \... or maybe `""` or `NULL` or
something.
