Sure? I can not believe!\
I have send you a Link to your Peer that always result in an 403-Error,
has you tested it?\
If i use [yacy.info/](http://yacy.info/){.postlink} from an IPv6-enabled
Internet-Connection comes approximate 20 percent of all randomly showed
Peers with an 403-Error. Try it.\
If you want i can send you a list of YaCy-Peers that mostly respond with
an 403-Error (but only as PN, i will respect the privacy of the peer
owners).\

This Problem is not inside the Proxy, this problem is in front of the
Proxy. And this Problem does not affect the Proxy, this problem does
affect the internal HTTP-Server and this is (in my opinion) a very
important part of the YaCy-Software.\

This is a hit in xioc752\'s face. He runs two YaCy-Peers and 50 percent
of this are not accessible, in my opinion this is a very high pressure.\

Okay, you will not support the proxy (i do understand this) but do you
want to support the HTTP-Server?\

It may be that you are not able to see this problem but you can ask us.\

Sure? I have offered my help multiple times, always without any
reaction. And now this, why?\
