Hi Orbiter,\
\
Thanks for the reply.\
\
I have one question about the ranking. I see there are two ranking
mechanisms, SOLR and RWI. The documentation states that some items in
the index only have RWI data available, but it\'s not clear to me what
circumstances that occurs under. Is that just because some network nodes
are on old YaCy versions that don\'t use SOLR internally? Or is there
some other circumstance under which a search result will only have RWI
data?\
\
Regarding Seeks, there are a few reasons why I chose not to include it
in my proposal (I\'m familiar with it). It doesn\'t seem to be actively
maintained and installation on current OS versions is extremely
difficult (or at least completely undocumented). To my knowledge Seeks
doesn\'t run on Windows, which limits its audience considerably. My best
understanding of Seeks\'s privacy features is that it only shares your
data with people who make similar searches based on a locality-sensitive
hash function; this makes it hard to evaluate a search algorithm on a
wide variety of searches. (I could be wrong here, as the documentation
is extremely weak on this.) And I\'m unaware of any anti-Sybil
algorithms used by Seeks, which would make it somewhat vulnerable to
spamming. (Again, maybe I\'m wrong, as the documentation is very weak.)\
\
I noticed that there are \"bookmark\"/\"recommend\"/\"delete\" icons
next to each search result; is this the upvote/downvote mechanism
you\'re talking about or is there something else I\'ve missed? I
haven\'t found any documentation on what those three icons currently do,
is there documentation available for them that I\'ve missed?\
\
Thanks!
