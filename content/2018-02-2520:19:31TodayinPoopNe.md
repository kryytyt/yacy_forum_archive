> Mattel, at Toy Fair, was showing the Flush N Frenzy game, in which
> players push a plastic poop into a toilet, roll the dice, and crank a
> plunger until the poop pops out. If a player catches the poop he or
> she gets extra points.
>
> Hasbro was promoting Don\'t Step in It, a game where players form
> poop-shaped mounds out of modeling clay and place them on a mat. They
> then walk the mat blindfolded and try to avoid stepping in the fake
> poop.
>
> Alex Brands in Fairfield has two poop-themed toy offerings \-- a game
> called Plunge It, where players compete to see who cam grab a foam
> poop with their plunger, and a soft foam PooBall, shaped like you know
> what.
>
> Florida-based toy company Basic Fun is selling a line of collectable
> characters called Poopeez. The characters, which have poop and
> bathroom inspired shapes and names, are sold in containers that look
> like toilet paper rolls, live in a made-up land called Kerplopolis,
> and star in a series of webisodes.
