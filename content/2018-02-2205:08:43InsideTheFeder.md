> \"I get e-mails even from police saying, \'Can you type in the serial
> number and tell me who the gun is registered to?\' Every week. They
> think it\'s like a VIN on a car. Even police. Police from everywhere.
> \'Hey, can you guys hurry up and type that number in?\'\" \[\...\]
>
> That\'s been a federal law, thanks to the NRA, since 1986: No
> searchable database of America\'s gun owners. So people here have to
> use paper, sort through enormous stacks of forms and record books that
> gun stores are required to keep and to eventually turn over to the
> feds when requested. It\'s kind of like a library in the old days \--
> but without the card catalog. They can use pictures of paper, like
> microfilm (they recently got the go-ahead to convert the microfilm to
> PDFs), as long as the pictures of paper are not searchable. You have
> to flip through and read. No searching by gun owner. No searching by
> name.
>
> \"You want to see the loading dock?\" We head down a corridor lined
> with boxes. Every corridor in the whole place is lined with boxes,
> boxes up to the eyeballs. In the loading dock, there\'s a forklift
> beeping, bringing in more boxes. \[\...\] Almost 2 million new gun
> records every month he has to figure out what to do with. Almost 2
> million slips of paper that record the sale of a gun \-- who bought it
> and where \-- like a glorified receipt. If you take pictures of the
> gun records, you can save space. \[\...\]
>
> \"These were Hurricane Katrina,\" he says, leaning against a stack.
> \"They were all submerged. They came in wet. And then we dried them in
> the parking lot. When they got dry enough, the ladies ran them into
> the imager.
>
> \"Do you want to see the imagers? I\'ll show you. Imaging is like
> running a copy machine. So, like, if there\'s staples? So what these
> ladies along here do, from this wall to this wall, from six in the
> morning until midnight\... staples.\" \[\...\]
>
> The vast majority of the gun records linking a gun to its owner are
> kept back at the various licensed dealers, the Walmarts, Bob\'s Gun
> Shops, and Guns R Us stores dotting America\'s landscape.
>
> We have more gun retailers in America than we do supermarkets, more
> than 55,000 of them. We\'re talking nearly four times the number of
> McDonald\'s. Nobody knows how many guns that equals, but in 2013, U.S.
> gun manufacturers rolled out 10,844,792 guns, and we imported an
> additional 5,539,539. The numbers were equally astounding the year
> before, and the year before that, and the year before that. \[\...\]
>
> Serial numbers, it turns out, are tangled clogs of hell. Half the time
> what the cop is reading you is the patent number, not the serial
> number, or it\'s the ID of the importer, and then you have the \"zero
> versus letter O\" problem, the \"numeral 1 versus letter l versus
> letter small-cap I\" problem, and then there is the matter of all the
> guns with duplicate serial numbers \[\...\]
>
> Step Two: Hester calls the manufacturer (if it\'s a U.S.-made gun) or
> the importer (for foreign-made guns). He wants to know which
> wholesaler the gunmaker sold the weapon to. \[\...\]
>
> Step Three: You call the wholesaler and say, \"Who did you sell it
> to?\" The wholesaler, who also has to keep such records, goes through
> the same rigmarole the importer or manufacturer did, and he gives you
> the name of the gun store that ordered it from him. Let\'s say it was
> Walmart.
>
> Step Four: If the Walmart is still in business, you call it. The
> actual store. Not corporate headquarters, or some warehouse, but the
> actual Walmart in Omaha or Miami or Wheeling. You call that store and
> you say, \"To whom did you sell this Taurus PT 92 with this particular
> serial number on it?\" By law, every gun dealer in America has to keep
> a \"bound book\" or an \"orderly arrangement of loose-leaf pages\"
> (some have been known to use toilet paper in protest) to record every
> firearm\'s manufacturer or importer, model, serial number, type,
> caliber or gauge, date received, date of sale. This record corresponds
> to the store\'s stack of 4473s, which some clerk has to go dig through
> in order to read you the information from the form. Or he can fax it.
> Congratulations. You have found your gun owner. \[\...\]
>
> There is no other place in America where technological advances are
> against the law. Unless you count the Amish. Even if a gun store that
> has gone out of business hands over records that it had kept on
> computer files, Charlie can\'t use them. He has to have the files
> printed out, and then the ladies take pictures of them and store them
> that way. Anything that allows people to search by name is verboten.
