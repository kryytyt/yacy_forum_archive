city ordered the SPCA to keep its robot off the sidewalks or face a
penalty of up to \$1,000 per day for operating in the public
right-of-way without a
permit.](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2017/12/08/security-robot-homeless-spca-mission-san-francisco.html)

> \"We weren\'t able to use the sidewalks at all when there\'s needles
> and tents and bikes, so from a walking standpoint I find the robot
> much easier to navigate than an encampment,\" Jennifer Scarlett, the
> S.F. SPCA\'s president, told the Business Times.
>
> Once the SPCA started using the robot on the sidewalks around its
> campus in early November, Scarlett said, there were no more homeless
> encampments. \[\...\]
>
> The people in the encampments showed their displeasure with the
> robot\'s presence at least once. Within about a week of the robot
> starting its automated route along the sidewalks, some people setting
> up a camp \"put a tarp over it, knocked it over and put barbecue sauce
> on all the sensors,\" Scarlett said. \[\...\]
>
> The robot is a K5 unit and has a top speed of three miles per hour,
> according to Knightscope\'s website. The units are more than five feet
> tall and weigh 400 pounds. They are equipped with four cameras, \"each
> capable of reading up to 300 license plates per minute\" and sending
> alerts when trespassers or people on a \"blacklist\" are in an area.
> \[\...\]
>
> Having humans replace the robot\'s 24/7 shift would be \"cost
> prohibitive,\" though, Scarlett said. The robot costs about \$6 per
> hour to rent, she said. The minimum wage in San Francisco is \$14 per
> hour.

*Gosh, that sounds \"prohibitive\". I guess they have \"no choice\" in
the matter.*
