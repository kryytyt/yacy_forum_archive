> Windemere Principal Megan Lee-Wilfong sent a letter to families Monday
> saying a neighbor had reported a drone with \"voice technology\"
> talking to children who were playing on school grounds in the evenings
> and over the weekend. \[\...\]
>
> The kids said the drone talked to them in a computerized voice from
> what looked like a built-in speaker. \"It keeps saying \'hey\' until
> you reply,\" Jacen said.
>
> The drone showed up sporadically above the playground multiple times
> two weeks ago. But last week, Gavin and Jacen said they saw the drone
> with their friends every day in the evening. Michael and Lois M. said
> they heard it, too.
>
> Gavin and Jacen said their friends said \"what\" back to the drone,
> and the drone told them to follow it.
>
> Michael M. said one of the children actually did. The child, one of
> Gavin\'s and Jacen\'s friends, started following the drone down the
> street to Dollar Tree, where the drone voice said it was going.
