Mitmachen â€¢ Re: Raspberry Pi
============================

I fully support what Low012 just wrote. I earn money with consultancy,
now mostly about YaCy. I constantly meet new customers who are afraid
that the \'product\' is not \'enterprise-ready\', because it\'s not
visible enough that there are many professional users. The more people
are able to find customers for their work about YaCy, the better it is
for everybody.\
\
Let me give another example about kickstarter and free software
development: I know [the developer of the
piratebox](http://piratebox.aod-rpg.de/dokuwiki/doku.php){.postlink} in
person and when I discovered that there was as very successful
[LibraryBox Kickstarter
Project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/griffey/librarybox-20){.postlink}
(which is a great idea but just gives the piratebox a new branding) and
fundet \>1000% I was afraid that the money goes into the wrong hands.
But what happend was, that the kickstarter project starter paid money to
the piratebox maintainer for further development of the piratebox and
thus that was all fine and good for everybody.\
\
So lets turn back to the RPi: I strongly suggest to use fast SD cards
with enough space, at least a 8GB class-10 card. There [are such cards
for only
\$8.95](http://www.amazon.com/Transcend-Class-Flash-Memory-TS8GSDHC10E/dp/B003VNKNEG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389347949&sr=8-1&keywords=class+10+8gb+sd+card){.postlink}
and even beyond class-10 there are [30mb/s 8GB sd
cards](http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-Class-Memory-SDSDU-008G-U46/dp/B00812K4V4/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1389347949&sr=8-5&keywords=class+10+8gb+sd+card){.postlink}
available for \$10.95. The pledge of \$25 for a fully configured card
leaves enough profit to use such cards.\
\
Has anyone experience with the full write speed to/from the SD card on
the RPi? I made some tests on my RPi (see
[above](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?p=27514#p27514){.postlink})
and the maxmimum speed was\
8GB SanDisk Extreme Pro 95 MB/s SD HC Class 10:\
1.5255Mb/sec, 97.63 Requests/sec\
\
\@q5sys: please test your prototype with\

Code: 
:   `sysbench --test=fileio --file-total-size=2G preparesysbench --test=fileio --file-total-size=2G --file-test-mode=rndrw --init-rng=on --max-time=300 --max-requests=0 runsysbench --test=fileio cleanup`

\
and compare
