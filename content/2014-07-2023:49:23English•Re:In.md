English â€¢ Re: Index Transfer
============================

some month ago I implemented an import method which stretches out to the
complete Solr Schema within the so-called surrogate input process. That
means that this process can now read in complete Solr XML exports if
there would be any process that produces such output\... I will
implement that if there is time left which is not at this time. With
such an full Solr-to-XML export it would then be possible to merge
indexes again in the same way as it was possible in the past before the
usage of Solr.
