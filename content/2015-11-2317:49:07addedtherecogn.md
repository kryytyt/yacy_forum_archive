``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
added the recognition of a peerid inside the push api which can be used
to distinguish specific peers, especially android (comes soon) clients.
Such client can retrieve statistical information using the push api. As
a first step, the push api now delivers the complete number of messages
that a client has harvested for the backend.
