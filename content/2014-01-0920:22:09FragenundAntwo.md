If you have yacy up and running, you can browse to: Administration /
Yacy Network / [Active
peers](http://localhost:8090/Network.html?page=1&maxCount=1000){.postlink}
and then look at the uptime column to find out for how long the active
peers are running. One seems to be online since 163 days. I think there
was once a peer up for over a year, without downtime.\

In my opinion, it runs very well under linux. I\'m using the mint distro
for my own yacy. <http://www.linuxmint.com/>\

I don\'t know. Some people say Java SE is faster, but I\'m using
Openjdk, because it\'s open source and it\'s preinstalled in linux
mint.\

16 GB RAM installed in my computer, and in the performance settings of
yacy I have set 8 GB. (The bigger your index gets, the more RAM it
needs. As far as I know, with 15 GB of RAM you should be able to
maintain an index with around 50 millions of links, but it also depends
on other factors. However, If yacy runs out of RAM, it will crash and
you probably wont be able to start it up anymore.)
