Dear Lazyweb, how do you shut up Apache SNI warnings?
=====================================================

Date: 2017-11-04 21:49:44

My logs are full of this unhelpful clutter:

> `[Sat Nov 04 13:36:50 2017] [error] Hostname www.jwz.org provided via SNI and hostname www.dnalounge.com provided via HTTP are different`{style="font-size:smaller"}

Conveniently, Apache doesn\'t log the IP address of the offending
connection, only the time, so it\'s not always easy to guess which
client is the problem. That one appears to be from Feedly, attempting to
fetch the DNA Lounge blog, while using www.dnalounge.com in the Host
header but using www.jwz.org in the SSL layer.

I can\'t even fathom how they might have fucked up that way.

So I tried adding `"SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck on"` to `httpd.conf` and that
just made it worse: now I get these with even more frequency than I was
getting the other warnings:

> ` [Sat Nov 04 13:42:40 2017] [error] No hostname was provided via SNI for a name based virtual host`{style="font-size:smaller"}

I\'m guessing most of those are from RSS readers too, but it\'s hard to
tell.

I just want to turn all of these warnings *off*. Is there a way?
