Fragen und Antworten • Citations and 1.92/9000
==============================================

Hi,\
\
In poking around, it seems the citation index is updated in 1.92/9000,
but maybe not used?\
\
For the past month I notice my citation count is always the same, but
the total document count and webgraph edges changes daily (mostly going
up in number).\
\
For example\

Code: 
:   `Citations(reverse link index)   50,774,484`

\
\
That hasn\'t changed in over a month. I also have not found a hard coded
limit in the code so far.\
\
I have a cronjob which pulls <http://localhost:8090/api/status_p.xml>
every day.\
\
Thank you for any answers.
