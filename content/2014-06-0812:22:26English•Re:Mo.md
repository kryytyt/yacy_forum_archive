English â€¢ Re: Monitoring Yacy in Cacti
======================================

I will try to make that guide in the following two weeks.\
\
For those who don\'t want to wait, a very small high level guide would
be:\
\
1 - Install SNMP. Although my solution to monitoring Yacy doesn\'t use
SNMP, it\'s important to install it so that you can create some basic
Cacti graphs like Memory Usage and CPU Usage, just to check that your
Cacti installation is correct.\
After installing SNMP, make sure it is up and running by issuing the
following command:\
\

Code: 
:   `snmpwalk -v 1 -c public localhost`

\
\
That should produce a list of OID\'s and their current values. (Please
refer to the wikipedia article on OID in what it refers to SNMP:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_identifier>)\
\
2 - Install Cacti and Cacti Spine. (Spine is an enhanced poller written
in C, thus much more efficient than the default Cacti poller cmd.php)\
\
After installation, make sure you change Cacti and Spine conf files (as
per Cacti wiki) to reflect the database name, user and password.\
\
3 - In your browser, go to <http://127.0.0.1/cacti>, follow the
instructions for first login and if everything is ok, add a device to
monitor.\
You will typically add your own machine. This is only to produce those
graphs I mentioned before, to make sure everything is ok.\
Just fill in a name and the ipaddress (if your own machine, 127.0.0.1).
In host template drop-down menu, choose Local Linux Machine.\
After saving, the left top corner of the screen will show some basic
information about the machine (or an SNMP error, if something is wrong)\
\
4 - In the device\'s screen, click on Create Graphs for This Host.\
Select one graph, click create. (try to select as many as you can).\
\
5 - Go to the Graphs tab.\
\
You will have to wait around 5 to 10 minutes before the graph begins to
show up.\
\
6 - If Cacti is working, then proceed with this.\
\
7 - Download and compile the C scripts (I did it with gcc -O binary-name
source-name).\
Execute the binaries to make sure everything is ok. You should see some
yacy stats filled with values.\
\
8 - Move the binary to Cacti scripts folder.\
\
9 - In Cacti, import the templates attached in my first post.\
\
10 - After that, you should have a new device named Yacy Server, and
when you try to create graphs for them, you should see a list of graphs
like SNMP Peer \... and SNMP Yacy \....\
\
11 - The scripts are currently sending its output also to syslog, in
case you want to check if they\'re running and producing values.\
\
I\'ll get back
