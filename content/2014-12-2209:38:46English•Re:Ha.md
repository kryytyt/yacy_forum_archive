This could be the root-cause of your problem, it seems your ISP use
Carrier-Grade-NAT and this makes it impossible for you to offer a
public/global accessible Service. Please ask your ISP for giving you a
real IP-Address or (even better) for real IPv6-Connectivity. If your ISP
is not able to do so, your only chance is an exchange of your ISP.\

canyouseeme and yacy.info show the Source-IP-Address of your incoming
connection. If it differs from the \"external\" IP-Address of your
Router (the Source-IP-Address of any outgoing Connection from your
Router), there is an additional Address-Translation between your Router
and the real public Internet. This \"between\" is your ISP.\
