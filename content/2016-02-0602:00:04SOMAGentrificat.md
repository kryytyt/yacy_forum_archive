> In City Hall, South-of-Market is spoken of in optimistic tones, as
> \"improving.\" That means that alleys formerly fit only for truck
> deliveries and sleeping men are now inexplicably filled with people
> waiting in line. Rents are going up. Sculptor Aris Demetrios, who has
> kept a studio South-of-Market for 20 years, is watching the warehouse
> space in nearby buildings go for \$1.50 a square foot\--a jump
> straight up from 25 cents. \[\...\]
>
> The Ramrod is a headquarters for this riding-crop set. At Eighth and
> Folsom, it was formerly nestled comfortably between wholesale foam
> outlets and welding companies. Now that the neighborhood\'s gone
> Yuppie, the Ramrod shares the block with four new restaurants and a
> conceptual art gallery. \[\...\] Inside it\'s homier than one might
> imagine, with a piano bar and a mural that looks like the weight room
> at the YMCA. The black-leather cowboys, still here though their
> numbers are diminishing, bar-hop on Folsom, looking fearsome and
> jingling their chains and spurs.
