where to start in YaCy ?\
I\'m confused!\
I did some simple research in YaCy, and did not have relevant results,
those same sites appear to have seen the videos on youtube about YaCy. I
ask, how do I change the location from country to search in YaCy, ie
restringer research to a certain place in the world, such as China? How
do I change the exact settings to perform research by country? Thank you
in advance for the answers!
