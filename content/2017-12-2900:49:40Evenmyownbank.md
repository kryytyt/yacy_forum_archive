the [new hotness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_fingerprinting)
in surreptitious privacy violation, you know.

And it makes *perfect sense* for my bank to be doing this to me, since
I\'m logged in and they already have all my money. They already have the
complete Identity Theft Kit, how much more do they need to know?

(Also [that dialog](http://jsblocker.toggleable.com/) should win some
kind of \"Enter to Exit\" award for inapprehensiblity.)
