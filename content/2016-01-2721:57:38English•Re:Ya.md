Interesting idea!\
\
Is that possible with yacy?\
I have zeronet running, and it runs under localhost:43110 with links to
actual pages with content like this:
[http://127.0.0.1:43110/1EU1tbG9oC1A8jz2 \...
5asrNsE4Vr](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1EU1tbG9oC1A8jz2ouVwGZyQ5asrNsE4Vr){.postlink}\
\
So how can I\
a) get yacy to index those sites\
b) get my indexed sites shared with other people, so they can also query
my results?\
\
The idea is this:\
I have zeronet and yacy locally running on the same computer and want to
add my own site as zeronet page in the format above.\
Then I want other people who also use yacy + zeronet to find my just
indexed website if they search for a keyword that indicates to content
on my 0-page.\
\
Would I need to define something like freenet, like a new shared yacy
network group, e.g. zerofreenet and share among those users who join
this group?\
How can I configure yacy to be able to test that?
