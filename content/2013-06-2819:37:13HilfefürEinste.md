the situation is.\
Russia adopted the anti-piracy law , under which includes all sites with
links to illegal content. Search engines when issuing the search give
references,including illegal content,that\'s the only trace and know
that it is not legal owner of the search engine is not possible.\
I don\'t know how to define a site with legitimate content or
not,because of their sheer number.\
Question.\
what can be done to the owner of the search engine in this case,\
Go to the foreign hosting,that is not welcome\
or are there other methods,to leave the site (search)on the server and
apply something of anonymity. Only I do not know how to do it.\
Sorry,English,and German languages I do not know,translate on-line
translator.
