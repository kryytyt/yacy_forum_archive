Tech Bro Algal Bloom
====================

[![](https://www.jwz.org/images/1_gbmxeay3idvzhympvl6vsq.jpg)It\'s not
so much that tech bros are bad in and of themselves, it\'s that they\'re
a indicator species for an ecosystem. Like an algal bloom, their
overabundance is a sign that the balance is
amiss.](https://tinyletter.com/metafoundry/letters/metafoundry-4-indicator-species)

> The Silicon Valley startup ecosystem depends on venture capital. If
> VCs are putting in money, they want to see a return (and a big one,
> because of the expectation that nine out of ten companies, at a
> minimum, will crash and burn). And they want to see it ASAP, because
> that\'s how the time value of money works, and because companies are
> burning money like liquid hydrogen as they try to achieve lift-off. So
> there\'s an enormous pressure on founders to produce, which inevitably
> selects for people who are prepared to sleep under their desk for the
> chance of having a breakout company (and, not incidentally, making an
> enormous return for their VCs, who are presumably sleeping soundly in
> their nice Design Within Reach beds). The system *doesn\'t* select for
> women, for people who have families or lives outside of work, for
> thoughtful people. And by not selecting for them, it actively pushes
> them out, creating a culture that rejects and is intolerable for them
> \[\...\]

> But there\'s more to it. What makes a startup a startup isn\'t that
> it\'s new (we call that a \'small business\'), it\'s that it grows
> rapidly, ideally exponentially. That pushes startups toward bits, not
> atoms (near-zero incremental cost), towards anything that leverages
> Metcalfe\'s Law, towards dark patterns of nonconsensual behaviour
> towards users (like strip-mining Contacts lists), towards eroding user
> privacy, to dumping everything users have created when the startup is
> acquihired, and towards falling back on invasive online advertising
> because having a viable business model was a distant second to growing
> a user base.
