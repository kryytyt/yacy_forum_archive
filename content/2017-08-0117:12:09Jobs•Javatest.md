Jobs â€¢ Java test Loop frequency counter to torture code
=======================================================

Date: 2017-08-01 17:12:09

Just need a frequency counter in java that I can add and remove and
torturer to find the fastest loop speed.\
I found 2 byte code optimizers but both failed.\
<https://www.freelancer.com/projects/java/Java-Loop-frequency-counter-torture/#/details>\
I will code what I find to my QB64 program.\
I guess I need to prove to myself if it makes a difference or not.
