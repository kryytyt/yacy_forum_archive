[Der Guardian hat noch ein paar
Thatcher-Anekdoten](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2013/apr/09/margaret-thatcher-the-best-15-anecdotes).
Die mit Mitterand finde ich schÃ¶n:

> It was about 12.20am, a few days before Christmas, and we still
> hadn\'t reached agreement, so the chairman called it to a close.
> Suddenly \[Francois\] Mitterrand launched into a great monologue about
> how we had reached the end of the road, we shall have to consider if
> we can ever manage this, and so on. When he finished, Margaret piped
> up, to my astonishment, and said: \"No, it hasn\'t been like that at
> all, President Mitterrand. It\'s been a very good meeting. We haven\'t
> quite solved it, but we will. Cheer up, Monsieur.\"
>
> A moment\'s pause, and then he said: \"I sometimes think Mrs Thatcher
> is even more beguiling when she is saying yes than when she is saying
> no.\"
