[Robin Bell said he kicked off the colorful display from a van parked
across the street around 9:15 p.m.
Monday.](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/artists-project-emoluments-clause-trump-hotel-article-1.3169102)

> It lasted 10 minutes before a security guard for the Old Post Office
> stood in front of the projector, blocking its feed.
>
> \"We had a couple great moments. A tour bus pulled up, people started
> clapping and taking photos,\" Bell told the Daily News. \"Everyone on
> the street, except for the security guard, seemed really happy.\"

> But Trump seems to have not yet developed a theory of mind. Other
> people are black boxes that supply either affirmation or disapproval.
> As a result, he is weirdly transparent. He wants people to love him,
> so he is constantly telling interviewers that he is widely loved.
> \[\...\] Trump\'s statements don\'t necessarily come from anywhere,
> lead anywhere or have a permanent reality beyond his wish to be liked
> at any given instant.
>
> We\'ve got this perverse situation in which the vast analytic powers
> of the entire world are being spent trying to understand a guy whose
> thoughts are often just six fireflies beeping randomly in a jar.
