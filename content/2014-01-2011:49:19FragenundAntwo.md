I\'m afraid that davidk is right - stability IS a problem.\
I have had setup YaCy on VPS machine, with dedicated domain for it.
Works fine - for couple of days. Then site made unacessible (\"Service
Temporarily Unavailable\" error). I still see in \"top\" that all YaCy
processes are running, memory used in 50%, HDD in 56%, system load
1%\... I have no idea why YaCy doesn\'t show it\'s page. Yacy is set on
Debian stable (50GB SSD drive, 4 cores, 4GB RAM).\
\
Also, I have set YaCy on second virtual server (on top of dedicated
machine, with only this one VPS on it) with 8GB RAM and 120GB HDD.
Ubuntu 12.04. Same situation.\
\
Most stable is YaCy on my Windows desktop machine, but this not a
solution for me\...
