I have made another small tweak, as I found the logging throughput was
nearing 1.5GB/day! That is a lot of logging. mostly INFO type things. I
came to this measurement by \"rough guess\", as each yacyXX.log file is
1MB in size, and there was about 1 minute between each time stamp on the
files.\
\
I have done a find/replace inside yacy.logging to change all INFO to
WARNING, we\'ll see how this does. It certainly will free up some I/O on
the disks - I think the logging might have been a high percentage of
total I/O but I am not too sure, has anyone else noticed this massive
logging to be a problem, or is it normally OK? IT seems to be in excess
of what a \'normal\' program might do.\
\
\*Edit note:\
\
I have found after restarting the processes to change the logging, that
the maximum memory on our 32 bit friend has changed:\
\
Memory Usage\
free: 84.88 MB\
total: 187.16 MB\
max: 580 MB\
\
Maybe during the first start when it copies yacy.init \--\> yacy.config
it did not use the Heap Xmx setting\... After the restart, I see it has
taken effect. I think the Xmx variable must be in
[MB]{style="font-weight: bold"}, and the \"Memory Usage max:\" must be
in [MiB]{style="font-weight: bold"}, as they never seem to match
exactly.
