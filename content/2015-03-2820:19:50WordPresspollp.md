WordPress poll plugin?
======================

Dear Lazyweb, is there a WordPress poll plugin that you like?

There are a bunch of them, but the thing I\'m most worried about is,
which one is least likely to open up a gaping security hole in my site?

The fact that there are a bunch of them makes me suspect that many folks
have considered writing a poll plugin to be their \"learning
experience\", and with PHP, that does not augur well for security.

Hoping for: polls are inline in a post (not a sidebar); questions are
multiple choice, boolean, numeric-range; multiple questions in a single
poll; authenticate in the same way as posting a comment (in other words,
not overly concerned about ballot-box-stuffing).
