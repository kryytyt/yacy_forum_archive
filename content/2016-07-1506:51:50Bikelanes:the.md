> During yesterday evening\'s rush hour, safe streets advocates \[\...\]
> started collecting hard data about how often the bike lanes on
> Valencia Street are blocked by motorists. Take a wild guess what they
> found: the bike lanes are a de facto loading-and-drop-off zone for
> cars. \[\...\]
>
> Things picked up \-- and got more dangerous \-- as the evening
> progressed. During the last hour, from 6-7 p.m. (Orland calls this the
> \"death trap\" hour) 205 bikes had to swerve into traffic on that same
> stretch of Valencia, thanks to 53 cars that blocked the bike lane \--
> remember, that\'s just one block of Valencia, and just one side of the
> street.

> Although not officially counted, the volunteers reported most of the
> cars had Uber or Lyft symbols on them. It should be noted that
> Streetsblog observed several police cars passing by, and two cops
> passing by on foot, but (no surprise) no citations were issued. That
> said, some drivers of the illegally parked cars seemed wary of the
> attention \-- one BMW driver drove off, but not before gesturing
> unkindly at Maureen Persico, a Bernal Heights resident and one of the
> counters. \[\...\]

> > The West side of Valencia between 16th and 17th saw some of the most
