From a brief glance at the source code, looks like this is related:
[https://github.com/yacy/yacy\_search\_ser \...
java\#L1473](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/cdb8f3b10d15edc75f68c8170a967289f7c40981/source/net/yacy/search/query/SearchEvent.java#L1473){.postlink}
. I don\'t fully understand what this code is doing, but it looks like
all it can do is choose whether to delete a result; it doesn\'t have any
influence on ranking. This leads to a question: what happens if a remote
node provides incorrect score/ranking data? Is there any way for a local
YaCy node to notice this and correct it?
