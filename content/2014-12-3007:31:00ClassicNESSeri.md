> The processor in the Game Boy Advance has a pipeline that has three
> relevant stages for accurate emulation: fetching, decoding and
> executing. In the fetching stage, the memory bus is queried for the
> memory associated with an instruction. This is then passed to the
> decoding stage, where the processor figures out which instruction it
> is. Finally, the processor actually executes the instruction. A naÃ¯ve
> interpreter may merge all three stages, either for hypothesized speed
> reasons, or just an uninformed idea of how processors work. mGBA was
> actually assuming the decoding and execution stages were combined
> until recently. However, an important observation was made while
> digging through the Classic NES Series games\' code: the game was
> modifying an instruction that was very close in proximity to where
> code was being executed already. \[\...\]

> What\'s imperative to understanding what\'s going on in this block of
> code is to realize that, once the instruction has been fetched by the
> pipeline, changing the memory that backs that address is irrelevant.
> This is similar to how cache coherence works, but is even more
> stringent. This means that if your pipeline is long enough, the
> instruction that enters into the pipeline during the write is the one
> that stores 255. If it\'s too short, it stores 0. As it turns out, the
> games will fail to boot if it finds the value 0 in register r1, but
> boots fine if it\'s 255.
