the blaring din of forklifts overturning dumpsters full of servers,

> CRT glass in six facilities in South Carolina, and the EPA has found
> warehouses full of abandoned glass in Arizona, Ohio, Colorado,
> Pennsylvania, New York, Utah, Massachusetts, and Kentucky in the past
> three years alone. \[\...\]

> That companies were still willingly paying Closed Loop to take their

> Closed Loop took taxpayer money to not recycle your old TV.
