> It\'s one thing to take a product that is already cheap and just fine
> and replace it with a vastly more expensive version that locks people
> into exploitative proprietary systems for years in exchange for giving
> them a 15 second hit of dopamine derived from Going Digital. I mean,
> Quip and Juicero and whatever Silicon Valley dildo company is selling
> dongs with DRM-equipped replaceable heads are actually fundamentally
> selling you a product. It\'s a horribly, uselessly expensive product
> that could only be embraced by chumps, but it\'s a tangible thing. The
> real next level is just inserting yourself into someone else\'s
> transaction and collecting a % while offering nothing. (When this is a
> job, we call it \"consulting.\") Why charge a lot for the blades when
> you can charge a lot for literally nothing?
>
> RentBerry is useful here because the word \"rent\" is literally in the
> name. Here\'s the value proposition that RentBerry offers. For
> landlords who are already raking in record profits, RentBerry provides
> a chance at making even more, as potential tenants must set upon each
> other in a dystopian nightmare auction system that compels them to
> ask, how much am I willing to pay to avoid sleeping in the park,
> really? For tenants, RentBerry offers\... well, the opportunity to pay
> more in a pre-existing housing crisis, the chance to make the process
> of finding an apartment an even more horrific exercise in stress and
> disappointment, a reason to hate faceless strangers with even more
> intensity, and more reason to view city life as a ceaseless
> Nietzschean struggle from which they will never escape. What RentBerry
> gets in return is, eventually, a % of your already hideously
> overpriced rent, for the duration of the lease. I bet you can\'t wait
> to know a portion of your rent check is going not just to the landlord
> you hate but also to a company that did nothing beyond giving him the
> ability to take more of your money! Of course, if you live in New
> York, your \"landlord\" might very well be a hedge fund that also
> funded RentBerry! Sweet, right?
