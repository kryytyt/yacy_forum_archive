> Unicode 7.0, standardized last June, added 2,834 new symbols to its
> lexicon. Around 250 of these were emoji, and operating systems have
> been updated in the months since to include support for many of these
> new pictograms.
>
> However, one of the Unicode 7.0 emoji has gone unimplemented: the
> catchily named \"Reversed Hand With Middle Finger Extended,\"
> codepoint U+1F595. Or as it\'s known in common parlance, the finger.
>
> **iOS, OS X, and Android all omit this important and expressive
> gesture.** The emoji obsessives of Emojipedia, however, noticed that
> Windows 10 bucks the trend and includes support for the one finger
> salute. As with other emojis representing humans and their body parts,
> the flip the bird emoji supports Unicode skin color. By default, it
> uses a non-human tone \-- Windows 10 uses grey for this, in contrast
> to iOS\'s Simpsonesque yellow \-- but it can also be shown with a
> variety of roughly humanoid skin tones.
