No, [that]{style="font-style: italic"} looks ridiculous, and is based
upon the brainless mysql. To begin with, the Sphider FAQ itself reveals
what kind of crashes are commonly encountered because of the underlying
mysql defects.\

For crawling a single website, you might have better luck with Open
Search Server. Its indexer isn\'t as well context-aware as Yacy\'s
though as it can only perform AND or OR queries, while Yacy ranks
documents upon dozens of scores. Also, OSS consumes much more RAM, and
AFAIK there are no proven OSS installations with indexes as large as the
ones found in medium-size Yacy peers.\

BTW, with the current Yacy version 1.83/9328 video search seems broken.
