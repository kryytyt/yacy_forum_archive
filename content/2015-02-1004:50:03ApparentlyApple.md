Apparently Apple would prefer that I not activate 2-factor auth.

![](http://www.jwz.org/images/b16vp_riaaa6we1.jpg)I was thinking about
enabling it on my Apple ID, but that seems to be impossible.

I have no idea what the answers to my \"security questions\" are \-- if
I ever filled those out at all, I almost certainly just pounded my fists
on the keyboard until the prompt went away \-- and the [alleged
option](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201485) to reset them using my
recovery email address does not exist. Apparently the only recourse at
this point, despite having two verified email addresses and a credit
card in their system, is to call them *on the phone* and speak to some
flunky *like an animal*.

So no 2-factor for me, I guess. Well played, Apple. Well played.
