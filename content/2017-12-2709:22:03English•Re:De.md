Hi ircamb,\
did you have a look at some of these pages :\
- W3C note on [Social Web
Protocols](https://www.w3.org/TR/social-web-protocols/){.postlink}\
- the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/){.postlink} community, notably
its [reply](https://indieweb.org/reply){.postlink} page\
- the [h-entry
microformat](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2#h-entry){.postlink}\
\
I guess there is there almost everything needed for decentralized
discussions, being either standards, agreement on formats by many
people, or rendering software implementations.\
\
To my mind the next questions to explore can be :\
- does YaCy currently properly interact with these already existing
formats?\
- should it be improved and to which extend ?\
- is it the appropriate place for a search engine to render
decentralized discussion threads, and how exactly should it be rendered?
