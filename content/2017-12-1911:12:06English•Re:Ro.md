English â€¢ Re: Robinson Only Displays PDF in Localhost, not External UR

Hello rashid,\
you have documents indexed with localhost URLs so this mean you are
using the intranet Network Definition, or \"Intranet Indexing\" Basic
Configuration setting isn\'t it?\
This mode is designed to run on private intranets, so indexed document
URLs are not supposed to be accessible from external networks.\
\
To index and share results on a publicly available server without using
peer-to-peer features, the Web Portal mode (\"Search portal for your own
web pages\" Basic Configuration setting) is probably what you need. In
this mode you will have to crawl your documents starting from publicly
available URLs (localhost or intranet domains URLs will be rejected).
Then your search results will provide only public URLs as expected.\
\
Best regards
