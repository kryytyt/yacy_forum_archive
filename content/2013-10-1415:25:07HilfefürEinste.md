This is really good idea i think. But i would not replace the yacy url
by a user url. The link to yacy should be left as is.\
\
Another way could be: Just give the user the ability to add an
additional part to the user agent string, example:\
\

Code: 
:   `yacybot (amd64 Linux 2.6.16-2-amd64-k8-smp; java 1.5.0_10; Europe/en) http://yacy.net/yacy/bot.html - This YaCy instance is maintained by www.userswebpage.com`

\
This could be really nice feature for people with their own theme
specific search instance.
