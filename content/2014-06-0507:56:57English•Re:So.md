1. Yes, you can choose to only crawl certain websites, and those
websites will be added to the global index.\
2. Pretty sure it does, but I\'m not 100% certain.\
3. I\'ve used it under a variety of circumstances on a laptop, with
mixed results. Under some circumstances it works great; under other
(more demanding) circumstances it can be a problem. My advice: try it,
see if it works for you, if it doesn\'t then stop using it and file a
bug report.
