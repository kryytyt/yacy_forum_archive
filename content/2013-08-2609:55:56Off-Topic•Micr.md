SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The long-running rivalry between Microsoft
Corp and Google Inc is turning into a schoolyard brawl.\
Microsoft on Wednesday opened a new front against the world\'s No 1
search provider by piloting an ad-free offering for educational users of
Bing, its search engine that for years has trailed Google.\
Under the free program called \"Bing for Schools,\" students in
participating school districts will no longer see ads or adult content
when they do Internet searches.\
Microsoft, which has signed up the Los Angeles Unified School District
and Atlanta Public Schools among other school districts, has pitched
Bing as an alternative at a time of rising public concern over how
Internet companies are tracking their users\' every move to target the
ads they display.\
As part of the program, Microsoft will also offer free Surface tablets
and course materials for teaching youngsters about Internet use.\
Stefan Weitz, Microsoft\'s director of search, said the program would
help expose young users to Microsoft products.\
\"We hope that we demonstrate the quality of Bing to teachers and
students and also their parents, and once they see how good it is, we
hope to see increased usage outside of schools too,\" Weitz said.\
Bing, with 18 percent of the search market share, has long trailed
Google, at 67 percent, according to data from ComScore, despite an
aggressive effort to close the gap.\
ATTACK CAMPAIGN\
Microsoft\'s move is the latest sign that technology companies are
targeting the education market as a way to reach children who will
become the next generation of consumers.\
The new Bing campaign, framed in the context of privacy concerns, is
part of a broad, anti-Google marketing campaign directed by a team of
political consultants including Mark Penn, long-time adviser to Bill and
Hillary Clinton.\
In recent months Microsoft has ramped up allegations posted to its
\"Scroogled\" website, including claims that Google violates its users\'
trust by scanning emails to target ads. Microsoft has also backed
promotion of a \"Do Not Track\" protocol that would discourage online ad
targeting.\
\"People just don\'t think it\'s appropriate to show ads to children in
a learning environment,\" Weitz said.\
A Google spokesman declined to immediately comment.\
While Microsoft relies heavily on software sales, more than 95 percent
of Google\'s revenue come from ads, and a significant portion of that
comes from its dominant search engine.\
JOSTLING IN CLASSROOMS\
Google and Microsoft have also been vying to get schools to adopt their
productivity software. Google has been offering a discount for its
Google Apps suite, which it hopes can replace programs such as Microsoft
Word on school computers.\
Tech companies, led by Apple Inc, have also competed fiercely to get
hardware into the classroom, even while academic studies are divided
over the effectiveness of gadgets in improving student performance.pdf

Following Apple, Google in December announced a program to give its
Chromebook computers to schools for \$99 each. Six months later,
Microsoft began offering its Surface RT tablet to educational
institutions for \$199, a discount of more than 50 percent.\
As part of the Bing campaign, school districts whose students use the
Microsoft search engine win points, which they can redeem for Surface
tablets.\
Aleigha Henderson-Rosser, the director of instructional technology at
Atlanta Public Schools, said she had no qualms about receiving aid from
tech companies. Atlanta schools will not be paid money to participate in
the Bing program, she said.\
Henderson-Rosser said she will try to rally parents to use Bing to help
win Surface tablets for schools that cannot afford the technology.\
\"I\'m seeing it as a community effort to fill in the gaps,\" she said.
\"What school is going to turn down tablets for our students?\"
