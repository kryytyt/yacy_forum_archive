Trying to find inspiration for a logo for CODEWORD, and I seem to have
become the Rupert Giles of Concentric Circles.

I\'ve already blown through my budget for paying actual designers to do
this, and we didn\'t really get anywhere, so I guess I\'m on my own.

Maybe I want an alchemical symbol for a nonexistent element. For a while
I thought I wanted a schematic of an Enigma rotor, but those end up just
looking like gears or circuit diagrams.
