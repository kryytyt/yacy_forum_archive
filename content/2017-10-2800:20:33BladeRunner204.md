Runner 2049* is not a good movie.

I feel like more than a sequel, it was an extended fan tribute, made by
people who, as a committee, didn\'t really understand the first movie.

They hit a lot of bullet points. I can almost see in my head the
planning meeting where the list was made: it\'s not really an action
movie. Slow burn. A wooden, silent protagonist who follows the linear
clues from A to B to C. Long, slow pans across the cityscape.
Monologuing supervillain industrialist. But despite hitting all of those
seemingly-compulsory parts of the routine, it falls flat. Much like how
the *Watchmen* movie, despite being nearly a frame-for-frame remake of
the comic, still fell so flat.

It is so chock-full of fan service and references to other things that
they mute what few new things it did bring to the party. \"Here are some
things that were in the first movie! Remember those?? Hey, remember how
the first movie had neon signs for Pan Am and Cuisinart, before they
went out of business? Look, here they are again! It\'s a thing that you
recognize! Do you recognize the thing??\"

There is a scene in the second or third act where some people are
listening to a recording of Decard\'s Voight-Kampff session with Rachel
from the first movie, and two of the characters start discussing what it
*means*. Wait, excuse me, did the screenwriter just *turn toward the
camera* and tell me his interpretation of the dialog in an older, better
movie? Yes. Yes he did. What the hell? This script is not your *blog*,
pal. I am not sitting on the couch *TV Yelling* with you!

I was aghast.

Even the score felt like it was making winking references. \"Hey,
remember this cue from Vangelis?\"

Now, to their credit, they did make a *long, slow detective movie*,
which is what the original was. To do that *at all* today is kind of
remarkable.

But, by and large, everything that was good in this movie reminded me of
other, better movies. And mostly those movies were not the movie to
which this one is a sequel!

Here, then, my list of grievances.

First off, Ryan Gosling is just a really boring actor. This role could
have been literally anyone, since he sleepwalks through the movie. Much
of that is on the writing, but his flat affect made it difficult for me
to care about any of the problems he was trying to solve, since he
barely seemed engaged in it at all. And when he went \"off book\", it
was hard to understand why, since he didn\'t seem to genuinely care
about anything.

Next, Jared Leto. *Jared Leto ruins everything!* What a complete tool.
This scenery-chewing buffoon is what we get to replace Joe Turkel\'s
masterful Eldon Tyrell? Please. I read somewhere that originally they
had wanted David Bowie to play this part. My question is, how far down
that list did they have to go?? How many people said no? How many
hundreds of names do you have to cross off below *David Fucking Bowie*
before you get to Leto? Did Will Ferrell and Carrot-Top turn them down?

As for things that pulled me right out of the story, why is Leto\'s
character blind? Dude you *literally own an eyeball factory*. I assume
that it\'s just a stupid affectation that his character adopts, because
he is a tool.

The relationship between the replicant and his chatbot was interesting,
though they certainly didn\'t explore any of the implications. He\'s
someone\'s property, she\'s his property, shit rolls down hill. It\'s
almost like there\'s a story there about autonomy, inter-species
romance, or a love story between two people who are somewhere between
\"poorly socialized\" and \"not quite real\". Oh wait, that movie was
called [***Her***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzV6mXIOVl4) and it
was excellent!

Every time someone in the movie (like the hooker dressed as Pris for
some reason) used the phrase \"Real Girl\" or \"Real Boy\" it was
immediately about *Pinocchio*, and I get it, I get it, you\'re a writer,
a hack writer, and if your script is about the nature of humanity you
can\'t resist throwing in a Pinocchio reference. But
[***A.i.***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBUAQGwzGk0) really,
*really* has that covered. I didn\'t even *like* A.i., but it should
have closed the book on this Pinocchio trope.

There\'s a scene toward the end where Jared Leto is trying to play the
devil and offer Deckard some capital-T temptation where they trot out a
CGI Sean Young lookalike for him to play with. (And in this scene I kept
thinking, \"Wow, Leto is a terrible Satan, hey, I should totally
re-watch [***Angel
Heart***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKiVe49AgSE), that was some
*quality* Devil-ing!) It\'s no surprise that she wasn\'t invited back
for this movie. You\'ve probably heard stories about \"crazy\" Sean
Young, but I suspect that\'s all bullshit, she\'s just someone who had a
few bad breaks and dropped out of that misogynistic meat-grinder of an
industry. (Here\'s an
[interview](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/26/blade-runner-sean-young-interview)
from a few years back, where it is clear that the field in which she
grows her fucks is barren.)

*Robin Wright as Rachel and Jared Leto as Dong-Fish.*
:::

Anyway, they trot out CGI Young Hotness and I\'m again pulled out of the
story thinking, \"Yup, I guess they\'re not going to give her a real
cameo. I wonder how much she got paid for them skinning a video game
avatar with her old publicity photos? I wonder if she made bank, or if
she got screwed on this deal because someone else owns her likeness?\"

Oh wait, I\'ve seen *this* movie too! It was called [***The
Congress***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHBl43lMJY0), and it is
about Robin Wright \-- who is also in this movie \-- playing herself and
selling off the likeness rights to her younger, more financially viable
image, to act in future movies without her involvement. I\'ve got to
believe that when Wright learned about this scene being in *this* movie
she went, \"Wait, what?\"

The original *Blade Runner* had three main characters: Rick Deckard, The
City of Los Angeles 2019, and Roy Batty. Everyone else was supporting
cast. It\'s nice that they brought The City back for a cameo, but it was
a shadow of what it once was, and honestly, it\'s done better work in
other movies.

For example, in the [***Ghost in the
Shell***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4VmJcZR0Yg) remake. Say what
you will about that movie \-- and there\'s a lot to criticize about it,
particularly its whitewashing (and *Blade Runner 2049* is a jarringly
white movie too) \-- but the exterior environments, the cityscapes in
*Ghost in the Shell* were absolutely *outstanding.* If you take away the
plot and characters and look only at the environment, *Ghost in the
Shell* is a far more faithful sequel to *Blade Runner* than *Blade
Runner 2049* is.

(Actually that\'s true for any of the many incarnations of *Ghost in the
Shell*.) Can you look at the skyscraper-sized purple-haired naked
hologram in *Blade Runner 2049* and *not* think, \"They lifted that
directly from *Ghost in the Shell 2017\"*?

While I give the sequel credit for (like the original) taking the time
to show the vastness of its setting, taking the time for slow crawls
through the environment, that doesn\'t fix the fact that the
environments were just\... *boring.* It felt like one long sepia
sandstorm from beginning to end.

When we take a road trip out of LA to Vegas, we learn that before the
city was abandoned, all of its gaudy statuary had been replaced with
gargantuan reproductions of the statues from The Korova Milk Bar from
[***A Clockwork Orange***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caOaQXdbFdg).
Really? That\'s all you got?

Overall, the various environmental imagery was\... good\... but not good
enough. Stop reminding me of other, better movies that I\'d rather be
watching instead!

Hey, remember that scene where Jared Leto decants a full grown and
terrified woman from a Ziploc® bag, while making some speech about how
his \"angels\" need to be able to breed and reproduce sexually in order
to fill the universe? (This theology is as confused as the science, but
moving on.) So this naked sticky woman falls out of the bag and he
somehow immediately knows that she is infertile (presumably by sniffing
her vag? I guess since he\'s \"blind\" he\'s *\"Matt Murdock, Ob-Gyn\"*
now?) Right so he lets her be born, wake up, and then he straight-up
murders her. How does that make *any* sense for the plot, or the
character, or the world-building? How is this anything but the writer
saying, \"I\'d like to see a nameless, naked crying woman get a knife to
the uterus, that would be rad!\"

By the way, this whole set-piece was *also* lifted wholesale from
someone else\'s earlier, more interesting work. in this case [Iris Van
Herpen](http://biopiracy.irisvanherpen.com/)\'s 2014 runway show called
[***Biopiracy***](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/03/iris-van-herpen-biopiracy/).

Which brings us to: how does the goal of breeding replicants sexually
make *any kind of sense?* If what you\'re after is a putatively-subhuman
slave caste, decanting them from the Baby Grobags™ as fully grown,
pre-brainwashed adults is *way* more efficient, especially if you\'ve
eliminated the *accelerated decrepitude,* which they clearly did long
ago.

Which brings us to: \"It\'s All About Family\". Sigh, again? Why does
*every* movie these days have to be about *babies?* Must every movie
preach at the audience that you\'re nothing if you don\'t breed? Is
someone subsidizing this, the way the Pentagon spends tax money to pay
football teams to put on [military
tributes](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/11/the-best-patriotism-money-can-buy/)
in their half-time shows? Is it the Big Baby Lobby?

(That question is rhetorical; the answer is, because Hollywood mandates
that All Movies Must Be About Family, because it\'s still 1958 and
that\'s the only way to get Ward and June to head out to the cinema
along with Wally and The Beaver. But knowing doesn\'t make it any less
irksome.)

I have a friend with an infant. He doesn\'t get out much these days, so
he has to pick his movie outings carefully. I warned him against this
one. He said, *\"Well, I\'m going to go see it anyway. But I\'m
boycotting it if they pull some shit like Deckard is
[Gosling\'s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkpCP9R1Jjc) father.\"*

I said, *\"Ok, lemme just stop you right there\...\"*

He started swearing, and I said: *\"But that\'s not even the worst part!
Jared Leto is the worst part!\"*

He said, *\"Wait, what? Jared Leto is in this movie? Are you just
fucking with me now?\"*

And finally:

One of the greatest things about the original *Blade Runner,* that made
it endure, is that there was *so much in it* that was hinted at and left
unexplained. And I don\'t even mean \"Is he or isn\'t he\". That movie
gave us a glimpse into a *vast* world and left so many questions open
not just about the environment and society but also the huge cast of
characters and their backstories and motivations. It set up lots of
questions, and then didn\'t answer most of them! It left you with so
much more to think about and talk about for *decades* afterward.

This movie wraps everything up in a neat little bow. There\'s nothing
left over. It is all explained to you. There is no mystery left. Except
*of course* they left a hook for a sequel.

*Blade Runner* is one of my favorite movies of all time. *Blade Runner
2049* just left me feeling sad. Not even angry, just sad. They had
*everything:* the set-up, returning actors from the original, all the
money in the *world*, and even an otherwise-decent director. And they
somehow managed to squander it.
