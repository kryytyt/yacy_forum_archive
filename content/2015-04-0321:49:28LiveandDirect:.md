These interviews are amazing, and it\'s kind of perfect that the
real-world story is *also* a story of hideous corporate greed.

> I said to her that, you know, this is a really boring idea. We\'re
> taking these music videos, which are really incredible, and then
> linking them together with stupid bits of graphics. It\'s just not
> interesting.
>
> I thought, maybe I should go with the whole idea of it being boring.
> What\'s the most boring thing I could do just to annoy everybody? And
> the most boring thing that I could think of to do, which would really
> go against the grain for the MTV generation \... was a talking head: a
> middle-class white male in a suit, talking to them in a really boring
> way about music videos.
>
> And I thought, \"Oh yeah, I\'m on to something here. This is really
> dull and uninteresting.\"
>
> \[\...\]
>
> As a consequence, national car parks spent about 3 million pounds
> changing all their \"Max Headroom\" signage to \"maximum height\".
> \[\...\]
>
> The Max suit was in two fiberglass pieces, and they screw you into it.
> \[Later on\] we had different versions of the suit. There was the
> tuxedo suit, there was a sort of golf suit, and then there was a white
> tuxedo \-- all equally cumbersome, and they went right down to your
> elbows, and you couldn\'t move around. But in a way, you compensate,
> and it becomes even more computer-generated \[looking\], because
> you\'re sort of rocking back and forth to make up for the gestures
> that you can do with your arms or your feet or whatever. So you end up
> looking like this sort of jack in the box, squirming around. The TV
> gods giveth, and they taketh away. And what they tooketh away, I
> added. \[\...\]
>
> For a time it was\... I won\'t say it was infuriating, but it was
> frustrating \-- you wanted to go, \"That\'s me, that\'s me, it\'s not
> a computer-generated man.\" But of course they wanted to swear me to
> secrecy because otherwise anybody could make a computer-generated man
> if they knew that it was as easy as putting on all this make-up.
>
> John Humphreys: I have to say, it was being presented as computer
> graphics, and I had people even say to me, who worked in some big
> companies in Britain, \"Oh, you\'ll soon be out of a job, look at
> this, it\'s all done with computer graphics!\"
>
> Peter Litten: It was very galling. It won a BAFTA for graphics, and of
> course other than a few lines, there weren\'t any graphics. A few
> wobbly lines. And they refused to enter us in the make-up \[category\]
> because they didn\'t want anyone to know it was make-up. \[\...\]
>
> One of the most bizarre things that ever happened was that Rocky and I
> were in LA, and the ABC version of 20 Minutes into the Future came on.
> We could not believe our eyes: it was a shot-by-shot identical
> retelling, with American actors that kind of looked like the English
> actors. We were flabbergasted that they would do this. They would go
> to such lengths to recreate props that we\'d found in skips and we\'d
> found in old junk shops and things.
>
> \[\...\]
>
> It was vicious in its condemnation of the way television worked. If
> you were a fan in those days, you\'ll remember lines like, \"The
> ratings are plunging, we\'re down to 58 million!\" and the one says,
> \"Well, we could go porno early.\" Of course we absolutely were biting
> deep into the bones and ligaments of the hand that was feeding us. And
> I don\'t think they noticed, I truly don\'t think they bothered to
> look at it until somebody somewhere said, \"This is the fifth column,
> these are all probably communists or something.\" \[\...\]
>
> The problem was we never had a lot of pushback from the network on
> anything we were doing. Let\'s face it, we were out there trying to do
> Blade Runner every seven or eight days. And for all my affection and
> respect for Peter Wagg and Steve Roberts, to some degree they were
> guys who not only had never done American network television \-- I\'m
> not sure they ever actually watched it.

I have always wanted to make a Max Headroom screen saver, but \-- and
this is shocking to me \-- I cannot find a 3D model of Max\'s head
anywhere on the interwebs.
