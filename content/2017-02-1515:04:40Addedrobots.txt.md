Added robots.txt support for heuristics federated search.

As noticed by @reger24, abusive use of OpenSearch systems should be
prevented, especially if allowing to parse and reuse HTML results.
robots.txt file is now checked before requesting an external OpenSearch
system to respect the host exclusions and eventual crawl-delay value.
The check is also performed when trying to add a new OpenSearch URL
template through the /ConfigHeuristics_p.html admin page.
