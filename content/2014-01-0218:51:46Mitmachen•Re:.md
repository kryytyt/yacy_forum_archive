Mitmachen â€¢ Re: Security problem with YaCy dev rel. 1.67
========================================================

sorry for the late explanation of this bug:\
during the migration from the old self-made httpd to jetty the httpd
proxy was migrated as well, but the security checks had been omitted. As
a first emergency-activity I twittered to migrate back, removed all the
development versions including all th jetty-updates and added a first
(but not sufficient) bugfix. Because my debian-deploymentserver was
still in the bag where I transported it for 30c3 and the bag was not at
the same place as I was at that time, it was not possible to make a
debian release with a bugfix. A standard tarball was created
automatically by the lulabad-release-script.\
\
At this time, two emergency-bugfixes should work which prevent unwanted
usage of the proxy. The debian version has been updated as well. The
dev-release update-servers should serve these bugfixes.\
\
I believe that the stunnel-problem is not related to the security
problem, but we will try to sort this out completely.
