Fixed shutdown for crawler.MaxActiveThreads value greater than 200

Shutdown was hanging in CrawlQueues.close() at
this.workerQueue.put(POISON_REQUEST) when config value
crawler.MaxActiveThreads was greater than 200.

Revealed by "Collision" Threads dumps in mantis 689
(http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=689#c1312)

Fixed consistency between this.worker.length and this.workerQueue
capacity, and made the process more reliable using non-blocking offer()
function.
