Thanks! Yes. This is a cheap possibility.

But this would not be a copy of a typical search, parse and index
process.\
\
At first, we need not only documents of sensless content, we need also
links between this content. So the program to produce this must have
more intelligence in order to produce typical links as in blogs or
forums. The test should use typical content with typical content
structures. Not a structure by accident.\
\
And, I hope, that the search result of a modern search machine is not
only a cheap statistic result of words in an ocean of words in an ocean
of pages. (1)\
\
I think, we should test with human content.

(1) Maybe YaCy is not more in the moment. So we should optimize the
indexing, the kind of distribution between Peers and the kind of
interpretation of human search strategy and what kind of result the
human user expects.
