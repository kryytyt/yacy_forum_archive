Good to know it works again.\
\
When you search in peer to peer mode, unfortunately results are not very
determinist given the nature of YaCy network and the implementation of
the federated search algorithm\... If you prefer to obtain results from
your own local index for some search requests, you should preferably use
the \"Privacy mode\" aka \"Stealth mode\" (the switch button is visible
on a local YaCy peer or only when you are authenticated on a remote YaCy
server).\
\
You do not exactly have a \"connection max\" option setting, but
something approaching in \"System Administration \> Performance Settings
of Busy Queues\" (/PerformanceQueues\_p.html page) : in the Thread Pool
Settings table, \"Crawler Pool\" maximum active value indeed controls
how many crawling connexions are concurrently active at a given time.\
\
I agree, YaCy can be quite complex to use and to adapt for one own needs
and also to maintain. To my mind much has still to be done, but your
feedback itself is also useful.\
\
In Crawler\_p.html, LF means Latency Factor, and MH means Max same Host
in queue. I won\'t have time to detail today the precise role of these
parameters on the crawler behavior, but if you are interested I can do
it later. And I note a descriptive title should be added there in the
user interface.\
\
Have a nice day
