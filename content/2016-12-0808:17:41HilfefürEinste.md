Hilfe für Einsteiger und Anwender • Re: Run YaCy on a reverse proxy?
====================================================================

Hello, some work has been done recently to make reverse proxy
integration a little easier by ensuring purely relative URLs are used in
the web UI (see <http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=106> where you can
also find some configuration samples). But as far as I know some tricky
points remain :\
- RSS feeds and OpenSearch descriptions URLs are absolute, so may need
to be rewritten by the reverse proxy\
- in the peer to peer protocol, YaCy advertises others it is listening
on port 8090 as default, or as defined in the [port configuration
property](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/Release_1.90/defaults/yacy.init#L11){.postlink}\
\
So currently you still need connections on ports 8090 (or the one you
configured) and eventually 8443 to be accepted by your reverse proxy.\
\
Improving this and allowing YaCy to bind on a local port and to
advertise peers about the reverse proxy public port for p2p operations
is not that far, a
[bindPort](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/Release_1.90/defaults/yacy.init#L29){.postlink}
config property is even already existing, but unfortunately not actually
used\...
