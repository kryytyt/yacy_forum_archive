English â€¢ Yacy on Linux with multiple IPs configured
====================================================

Date: 2014-08-22 14:18:03

I am trying to run Yacy on Arch Linux.\
\
I have multiple IP networks configured on a single ethernet port.\
\
The system is up and running and crawling sites but I am getting the
\"You cannot be reached from outside\" message.\
\
I have tracked this down to yacy binding to the last IP address in my
configured network list instead of the actual IP of the port that can
access the internet.\
\
On the system status page my IP is listed as:\
Address\
Host: 192.168.0.151:8090\
Public Address: <http://10.95.4.28:8090>\
\
The host address should actually be 10.95.4.28, 192.168.0.151 is the
last configured IP address.\
\
Is there any way to force yacy to use the correct IP? or is this a bug?
