English â€¢ Re: User poll: feasible, but missing feature?
=======================================================

Have 2 install modes Typical and Advanced.\
\
Typical: Would have no user decisions needed to run a peer to try out eg
JNR Peer like current setup but no peer name or anything to configure.\
\
Advanced: Similar to what is currently happening to an install of Yacy.
eg SNR Peer\
Option: to set Process Priority for Java VM in windows machines at
setup.\
\
Also a scheduled snapshot of all yacy\'s folders to be stored in another
location in-case of a disaster.
