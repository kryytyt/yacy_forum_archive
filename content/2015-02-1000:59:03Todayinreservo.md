> City Hall sources tell us that Martin Sanchez, a \$111,000-a-year

> Utilities commission spokesman Tyrone Jue said the 674 million-gallon

*At least [this
time](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/06/eight-million-gallons-of-water-drained-from-reservoir-after-man-urinates-in-it/)
they didn\'t \"need\" to drain it, since it was already drained. In the
interest of full disclosure, I think you should know that I have peed in
both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and so we\'d better drain them
right away.*
