For sure it\'s annoying. What is strange is that your peer can crawl
websites, but apparently can not reach other YaCy peers\...\
Do you get \"remote\" results when you search something, or only
\"local\" results from your own peer?\
\
By the way, if you whish to give here or by private message your peer
hostname or IP, maybe I could find a way to understand what\'s going
wrong.
