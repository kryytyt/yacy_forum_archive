> \"I\'m infuriated, I\'m angry,\" San Francisco Recreation & Park
> Department General Manager Phil Ginsburg told KTVU Tuesday. \"Over the
> weekend, some idiots broke into the construction site and did about
> \$100,000 worth of damage.\"
>
> Ginsburg said intruders stole a construction cart, hotwired it and did
> donuts on a newly sodded field, damaging a new irrigation system.
>
> Vandals also tagged the cement roof of the park\'s new storage
> facility and even lit a campfire in a corner of that facility to roast
> s\'mores, leaving behind marshmallows, chocolate and graham crackers.
