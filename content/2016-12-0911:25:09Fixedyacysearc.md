Fixed yacy search navabar header overlapping at various screen sizes.

- using a icon-only admin button at small and medium screen size
- using a icon-only "Search Interfaces" button at small screen size
- hiding the YaCy brand at extra-small screen size

Fixes the header part of mantis 708
(http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=708).

Navigator button overlapping is still to fix.
