This is in general a very good idea, but\

(which is also not a bad idea) does not work. The reason is, that the
scheduler for the API actions does not work this way. Here is how it
works:\
- there is a \"cleanup\"-process which runs every 10 minutes (you can
change this in /PerformanceQueues\_p.html, see \"Delay between busy
loops\" column for the \"Cleanup\" row)\
- as part of the cleanup-process (which does a lot, i.e. cleaning
caches, running postprocessing etc.) the API table (see also:
/Tables\_p.html?table=api ) is checked for processes that are due which
are then startet all at once\
\
That means, even if you configure 3.6 seconds distance between such
starts in the schedule, a set of then would be startet at once.\
Outside of the automatism that you want to establish I suggest the
following two options to solve the scheduling-problem that comes from
the current architecture.\
\
- either move the API-scheduler process out from the cleanup-process
into it\'s own busy thread so you can change the frequency you want to\
- or add a delay option in the scheduled process start so you can cause
that the api calls are not made too fast after each other\
\
While the first option is much more work I would suggest that this is
the better option. Additionally, the second option could be established
independently from the first one.
