== Peer Profile Export ==\
This servlet is able to provide a remote peer profile as property list.
A default peer does not have a peer profile, therefore in the average
case this servlet cannot be used and is a stub for future use cases.\
\
=== Operations performed when the servlet is called ===\
A file at \<code\>DATA/SETTINGS/profile.txt\</code\> is read as property
file and it\'s content is returned as property list.\
\
=== Servlet Address ===\
The servlet path is \<code\>/yacy/profile.html/code\>.\
The full URL is
\<code\>\<nowiki\>http://\<peer-IP\>:\<peer-port\>\<servlet-path\>\</nowiki\>\</code\>.\
\
=== Properties in the http header ===\
The caller must obey the \[\[Dev:APIHttpHeader\|http header rules\]\].\
\
=== Properties in the http post-arguments ===\
There are no post-arguments. Just call the servlet without post
properties.\
\
=== Result ===\
The returned document contains a list of property lines. These
properties are key-value pairs where the key and the value is separated
by a \'=\'.\
\
=== Example Usage ===\
