YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: Increase the priority of the \'Re-Crawl Index Documents\'
==========================================================================================

Ok LA\_FORGE, I didn\'t played much with this feature, so it is possible
there is something to fix so the performance settings on this task are
not so easily lost\...\
\
By the way, if you wish to experiment with the Thread priority property,
you can modify the
[RecrawlBusyThread](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/Release_1.90/source/net/yacy/crawler/RecrawlBusyThread.java#L67){.postlink}
class : just change the line

Code: 
:   `this.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);`

to

Code: 
:   `this.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);`

or

Code: 
:   `this.setPriority(value);`

with a value between 1 and 10 (Max priority).\
\
But please note the only involved code is in the
[RecrawlBusyThread.job()](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/Release_1.90/source/net/yacy/crawler/RecrawlBusyThread.java#L150){.postlink}
method performing a Solr request to select documents to recrawl
([RecrawlBusyThread.processSingleQuery()](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/Release_1.90/source/net/yacy/crawler/RecrawlBusyThread.java#L167){.postlink})
and feeding URLs to the local crawler
([RecrawlBusyThread.feedToCrawler()](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/Release_1.90/source/net/yacy/crawler/RecrawlBusyThread.java#L113){.postlink}).
Then local crawler performance settings applies.\
\
If you really wish, you can also modify the local crawler Thread
priority when it is created, in the
[Switchboard](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/Release_1.90/source/net/yacy/search/Switchboard.java#L1073){.postlink}.\
\
Happy hacking!
