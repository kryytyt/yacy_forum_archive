English â€¢ Using yacy for create local distributed crawler
=========================================================

Date: 2014-05-05 22:59:19

Hi,\
I am a new user to yacy. I was wondering is there any way to configure
yacy in a way that it can be installed on local cluster without any help
from other yacy peers around the world? I mean I want to have my own
peer list (on local network) and I need some kind of load balancer for
this cluster of yacy. I dont want to give each crawler peer the static
list of web sites that should be crawled! I want to give them a list of
whole sites and load balancer assign them to each peer. Also is there
any way that I can integrate yacy with NOSQL databases such as Hbase? If
yes is there any tutorial available for doing that?\
Regards.
