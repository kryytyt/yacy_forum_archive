> 15\. Disney World, Lake Buena Vista, Florida - for more on this, read The
> Disney Bloodline, which includes among other things, an extensive
> break-down about how Fantasia is used as \"a standard programming
> tool.\" Really, the whole Disney empire is suspect, what with the
> underground tunnels with human programming rooms.
>
> 14\. Salt Lake LDS Temple, Salt Lake City, Utah - there\'s a lot of
> symbolism that can be tied to the Illuminati, but this isn\'t so much a
> hidden truth as it is related to the life of Mormon founder Joseph
> Smith, Jr., as his older brother and possibly his father were
> Freemasons.
>
> 13\. Statue of Liberty, New York City - the initial post is just tying
> the sculptor, Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, to the Freemasons, but it goes
> deeper than that. See more: Brad Meltzer\'s Decoded - Statue of Liberty
