English â€¢ Re: Cache deletion needed.

As said smokingwheels copying a YaCy install (eventually compiled from
sources) and its DATA folder to a new location will work.\
\
But given your previously mentioned paths I guess you installed the
Debian package, so copying the various installed files is maybe not your
best option.\
\
By the way, both HTCACHE and INDEX folders can be configured.\
- HTCACHE :\
- with the administration page \"RAM/Disk Usage & Updates\" \> \"Web
Cache\" (/ConfigHTCache\_p.html) : you can modify the field \"The path
where the cache is stored\"\
- or with the generalist administration page \"System Administration\"
\> \"Advanced Properties\" (/ConfigProperties\_p.html) : \"proxyCache\"
property\
- or by editing manually the \"proxyCache\" property in your
/etc/yacy/yacy.conf file\
- INDEX :\
- with the generalist administration page \"System Administration\" \>
\"Advanced Properties\" (/ConfigProperties\_p.html) :
\"indexPrimaryPath\" property\
- or by editing manually the \"indexPrimaryPath\" property in your
/etc/yacy/yacy.conf file\
\
You will need to restart YaCy after modifying these settings.\
\
Happy customization.
