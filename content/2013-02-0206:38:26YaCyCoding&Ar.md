YaCy Coding & Architektur â€¢ Greasemonkey Script for Initiating Crawls
=====================================================================

Date: 2013-02-02 06:38:26

The proxy is a cool way to automatically fill the index, but as I
understand it, it doesn\'t play well with sites which use cookies. I\'ve
thrown together a proof-of-concept alternative which uses a Greasemonkey
script to initiate crawls of all URL\'s which are visited. It also
allows the crawls to have a customizable depth, which I think the proxy
doesn\'t support (I believe the proxy only indexes the single page which
is visited).\

The code is at <https://github.com/JeremyRand/YaCyIndexerGreasemonkey> .
Just thought people might be interested in it.\

thread to a different area if necessary.)
