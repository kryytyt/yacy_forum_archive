This Message is caused by a Bug in YaCy.\
You have the \"transparent Proxy\" disabled, this is correct if you do
[not]{style="text-decoration: underline"} want to route all your
HTTP-Traffic to the public Internet through your YaCy-Peers. The lead
through of information through a YaCy-Peer is only necessary/useful if
your Peer must crawl all this informations for adding it to its local
Index. If your local Index is only used for Data from your local
Intranet and you use the dedicated Crawler-Jobs of your YaCy-Peers for
crawling it, then you should not use the transparent Proxy in YaCy.\
The Problem is caused by the design decision for using the same TCP-Port
for the Proxy and for the HTTP-Server (that serves the admin & user
pages). That means there must be a piece of Code that decide for
[all]{style="text-decoration: underline"} incoming connections which
internal service (Proxy or HTTP-Server) must handle the incoming
connection. This kind of decision can not be perfect for all possible
situations, and it seems that you have a situation that trigger the
problem. In your situation YaCy decides that the incoming connection
(your accesses to the admin & user pages) should handled by the Proxy,
but the Proxy is disabled and respond with the well known
403-Error-Page.\
\
There exist at the moment no real workaround for this problem, but
sometimes it can help to restart the YaCy-Peer.\
