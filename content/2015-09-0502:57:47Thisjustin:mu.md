[Poison-Injecting Robot Submarine Assassinates Sea Stars to Save Coral
Reefs](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/poison-robot-submarine)

> COTSBot is a 30-kilogram yellow torpedo with a maximum speed of over 2
> meters per second and an endurance of over 6 hours. Five thrusters
> give it the capability of briefly hovering in the water column, giving
> it time to attack crown of thorns sea stars with an integrated poison
> injection system. It\'s completely autonomous, down to the
> identification and targeting of COTSS lurking among coral. \[\...\]
>
> When these outbreaks happen, swift and comprehensive eradication
> becomes a priority to keep reefs intact, but human divers can only
> manage to kill about 120 sea stars per hour with poison. Last year, a
> much more effective poison was developed at James Cook University in
> Queensland, Australia, called thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose
> agar that can kill a COTSS in 24 hours after a single injection,
> causing \"discolored and necrotic skin, ulcerations, loss of body
> turgor, accumulation of colourless mucus, loss of spines \[and\]
> large, open sores that expose the internal organs.\"
