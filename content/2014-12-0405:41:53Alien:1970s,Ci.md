[All of this is fantastic, but especially
this:](http://typesetinthefuture.com/alien/)

> CODE No 1 into that funny-looking keyboard? Well, it turns out to be a

> Yoni is a symbol for the Hindu Divine Mother, an embodiment of Shakti,

> Now, Agaric Fly \-- or Fly Agaric, as it\'s more commonly known \-- is

> So why are all of these strange references on the Nostromo\'s
> emergency destruct keyboard? Well, according to the [Alien
> Explorations
> blog](http://alienexplorations.blogspot.com/1979/05/simon-deerings-auto-destruct-panel.html),
> designer Simon Deering needed some complex-sounding labels for the
> keyboard at short notice. He was reading *The Secret Doctrine* by
> Helena Blavatsky, a Russian philosopher and occultist, at the time of
> filming. Blavatsky\'s book attempts to explain the origin and
> evolution of the universe in terms derived from the Hindu concept of
> cyclical development. Deering found his inspiration in its pages, and
> the Nostromo\'s odd keyboard was born.
