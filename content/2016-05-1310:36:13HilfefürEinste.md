Hi everyone, I am requesting you some advice or ideas for setting up
YaCy in the following scenario (sorry to post in English) :\
\
Let suppose I have some software hosted on GitHub or a blog hosted on a
blogging platform or any web content on a central repository. I am bored
with that and I want to self-host my content or at least choose my
hosting organization.\
So I may choose to run my own instances of GitLab and WordPress for
example. I will be able to set-up a YaCy node in webportal mode and
index my own content. Ok, great! Everything looks fine : visitors will
be able to search my content, and I will contribute to the YaCy
freeworld network.\
\
But I still want visitors to be able to search my content among a larger
community, as it was possible on the original platform. To my mind it
looks like this part is not so obvious\...\
So how would you proceed and on which YaCy configuration options would
you rely? Do you know examples of such communities or maybe the extra
tools required?
