Any progress?\

Language detection is a core feature for a search engine and in YacY it
barely works. To my understanding, detection is currently based on date
format recognition and \<head\> tag. We both already know this is fuzzy
at best.\
\
For as much as it\'s simple, the algorithm I implemented in JS for my
TTS software works very well for all the six supported languages. I also
provided you with a demonstrative package ready to download and run, so
to rapidly taste its effectiveness with the bundled demo. I also know
you have experience with JS so you can understand the code.\
\
I submitted many patches to other FOSS projects in the past; its
unfortunate Java is not in my cultural baggage yet. Can you at least
tell me where in the priority list is a reimplementation of the language
detector?
