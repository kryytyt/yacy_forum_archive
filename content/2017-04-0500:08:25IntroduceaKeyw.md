Introduce a Keyword search navigator using the index field keywords.
The keywords field string is split into words as navigator entries.

A keyword navigator facet is essential for search appliance usage were
documents and metadata use often specialized keyword vocabularies to 
filter search results. This navi can be used without custom index schema.

As we don't have defined a search query command to filter "keywords" yet,
the filtering is limited by adding the keyword to the search query.
