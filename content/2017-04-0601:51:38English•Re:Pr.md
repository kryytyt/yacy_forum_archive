I only joined these forums recently myself, so I am not certain how much
help I can be to you. It would seem to me however that in order for the
crawler to produce a progress bar, it would have to know how long the
process should take. Since that determination cannot be made until the
site has been crawled, I would think that a crawler progress bar would
be impossible. Just a thought though.
