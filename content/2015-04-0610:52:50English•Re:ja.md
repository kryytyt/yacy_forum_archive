Linux 32 bit should be able to have 4gb Java memory but windows uses
double overhead process and it maxes out at 1.6 GB and crashes.\
There is a topic some where on here I will see if I can find it.\
\
If you are running Linux Set your crawl running and try logging the
system processes eg top \> system.txt with ctrl-c to end it after the
yacy server crashes.\
\
It looks like you copied a windows yacy to Linux please let us know if
this is true?\
Should work but would need more experienced person to let me know.\
\
If on a Virtual machine you must enable a swap file yacy will work for a
little while without one.\
