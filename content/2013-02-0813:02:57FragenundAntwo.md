Ok, I\'m back.\
I have followed your advice on updating Yacy, but I\'ve chosen the
option Automatic Install, on the Manual Update section.\
Now, my question is:\
Does this install process takes significant time?\
Because it\'s been now some 10 minutes after Yacy started the install
process and opened a CMD window (I\'m running over Windows Vista), which
seems to be filling the scren with infinite dots, and nothing seems to
happen.\
Is this normal?
