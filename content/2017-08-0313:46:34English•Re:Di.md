Going on the figures you supplied your peer is using 20 GB per million
docs.\
When you crawl some sites there is a lots of noise that is picked up eg
extra domains, I am unsure why that is.\
\
My peer is below 4 GB per million docs I think this is due to the long
black list I have its over 80 000 now however it slows the crawling
speed down to about 1/5 th.\
If anyone wants a copy I can put it on a cloud server to download.
