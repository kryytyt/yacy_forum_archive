[Its north pole is dominated by a central cyclone surrounded by eight
circumpolar cyclones with diameters ranging from 2,500 to 2,900 miles
across.](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-juno-findings-jupiter-s-jet-streams-are-unearthly)

> Jupiter\'s south pole also contains a central cyclone, but it is
> surrounded by five cyclones with diameters ranging from 3,500 to 4,300
> miles in diameter. Almost all the polar cyclones, at both poles, are
> so densely packed that their spiral arms come in contact with adjacent
> cyclones. However, as tightly spaced as the cyclones are, they have
> remained distinct, with individual morphologies over the seven months
> of observations detailed in the paper.
>
> Another Juno result released today suggests that beneath the weather
> layer, the planet rotates nearly as a rigid body.
