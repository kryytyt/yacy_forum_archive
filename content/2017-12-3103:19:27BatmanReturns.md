Batman Returns
==============

[This is a pretty solid argument that *Batman Returns* is The World\'s
Greatest Christmas
Movie.](http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/75-thoughts-i-had-while-watching-batman-returns-the-worlds-greatest-holiday-movie)

Though I may be unduly swayed by all the Catwoman GIFs.

> 1.  Forget Christmas carols or sweet scenes of family harmony. *Batman
>     Returns* begins with a Pee-Wee Herman cameo and two rich jerks
>     pitching their cat-eating baby into a river to drown.
> 2.  Monstrous infant \-- so screamy and wild \-- does not die, but
>     rather slides down the dark sewers of Gotham City to a colony of
>     penguins. It\'s a holiday miracle!

> 36. Oh, Penguin. How preposterous that this gross man with disgusting
>     eating habits, tiny hands, awful hair, repugnant behavior, and no
>     prior political experience could be considered a viable candidate!
>     Oh, wait. Oh GOD.
> 37. Batman\'s out battling evil clowns. Catwoman\'s out smashing the
>     patriarchy.

> 52. Selina was killed by her boss for being \"too good\" at her job.
>     Catwoman is killed by the Penguin for rejecting his sexual
>     advances. When she screams, she shatters the glass ceiling.

> 56. This monstrous man, who feels he\'s entitled to women\'s bodies
>     and owed wealth and power, sees his political prospects dashed
>     when a disturbing audio tape revealing his atrocious true colors
>     is played for the public. What a delightful fantasy world this is!

> 63. Once the whole \"kill the children\" plan fails, Penguin spins in
>     an instant to Plan C, which involves strapping missiles to the
>     backs of hundreds of penguins. Which means he had hundreds of
>     missiles and penguin straps at the ready. Which means Penguin had
>     this contingency plan in his pocket all along. It\'s like he
>     didn\'t even really care about being mayor. It\'s like he just
>     wanted the attention, not the responsibility. Can you imagine a
>     man as monstrous as that?
> 64. Penguin is Trump is what I\'m saying.
