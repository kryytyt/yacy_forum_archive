Youtube has finally destroyed their RSS feeds
=============================================

few days ago they turned off the v2 API in favor of v3, but v3 has *no*
mechanism to get an RSS feed (or any other kind of listing) of a Youtube
user\'s uploaded videos without authenticating first.

Because RSS feeds are not a thing that you should want.

*Youtube: every day, making everything worse, in every way.*

I don\'t know if anyone but me is using my
[youtubefeed](http://www.jwz.org/hacks/#youtubefeed) program, but if you
are, and you had Youtube users in your feeds list, you\'ll need to
upgrade, and cope with the horrible fact that it now has a dependency on
[youtube-api.pl](http://www.jwz.org/hacks/#youtube-api). (You\'ll need
the latest version of that, as well as of
[youtubedown](http://www.jwz.org/hacks/#youtubedown).)

But using
[youtube-api.pl](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/09/youtube-api-pl/) at all
means that first you have to jump through a bunch of hideous hoops to
generate authentication keys and session IDs, pretty much ensuring that
it\'s far too much of a pain in the ass for anyone to actually use it.
Are you using it? Let me know.
