Hello,\
I also had difficulties with YaCy when I was previously running it
behind a router without UPnP\... What is strange is that this method
works on your windows machine but not on your Debian one (on my own
current Debian YaCy install, using UPnP works fine). Are you sure there
are no firewall rules activated on your Debian that you could have
missed?
