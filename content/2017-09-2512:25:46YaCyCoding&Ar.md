Hi Luc,\
\
exactly, I just pulled the newest commit with the command\
\
git clone <https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server.git>\
\
then made a few hacks because of my giant index size of 200 million
documents. But I didn\'t touch code related to the postprocessing
procedures, because the lack of java skills. Then I just compiled the
sources with the command\
\
ant clean all\
\
I additionally added the switches -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:+UseNUMA to the
startup script, In multiprocessor environments these switches increase
the performance a bit.\
\
Yes you\'re right, I think the integration of the latest solr version is
jointly responsible for the performance gain, too.
