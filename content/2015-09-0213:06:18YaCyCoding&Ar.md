YaCy Coding & Architektur â€¢ WebRTC for YaCy: p2p in browser plug-in
===================================================================

Some time ago I had a discussion with mozillians about the development
of a P2P protocol for a distributed search engine based on
[WebRTC](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC){.postlink}. Just recently
I discovered the project
[SchoolNinja](https://github.com/ScholarNinja){.postlink} which is an
attempt to implement p2p search with WebRTC. I also got into contact
with [\@juretriglav](https://twitter.com/juretriglav){.postlink}:

WebRTC would bring p2p into the browser while users are still forced to
\'install something\' which was a big problem for the growth of YaCy. It
looks like that WebRTC works only as browser plug-in, not as embedded
JavaScript, as far as I understand. However, it would be good to get the
foot on the ground of that technology to explore it\'s capabilities.\

What do you think? Would you like to have a YaCy Plug-in with p2p
activity in your browser? What would you expect what it does?
