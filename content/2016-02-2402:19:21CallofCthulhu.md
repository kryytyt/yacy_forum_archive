> *Steve:* I am pretty pumped to be running Call of Cthulhu. I wanted
> the 1890\'s version, but you insisted on the 1990\'s for some reason.
> \[\...\]
>
> *Zack:* At the height of his power, Kurt Cobain turns from grunge
> music to cosmic mysteries. He has some additional skills that will
> help him research the occult and use magic.
>
> *Steve:* What about your other party members?
>
> *Zack:* They are Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes and Eric Lynn Wright AKA
> Eazy-E.
>
> *Steve:* Are they mercenaries?
>
> *Zack:* No, they are amazing performers, but also a demolitions expert
> and a linguist specializing in ancient languages respectively.
>
> *Steve:* How did they meet and form a group?
>
> *Zack:* The 1992 MTV Video Music Awards. When Krist Novoselic threw
> his bass into the air and died on stage performing Lithium and they
> all joined forces to turn him into salt and resurrect him.
>
> *Steve:* Did it work?
>
> *Zack:* Not really. He\'s alive, but he came back changed. He\'s
> pretty much phoning in his performances and he eats mice.

It goes on like this *for days:*

> *Zack:* You aren\'t planning to do anything \[about Morton Downey
> Jr.\'s Presidential run\] until Left Eye receives an email message
> that can\'t be ignored. It comes from a guy named Remo Harris. Before
> Chili joined TLC, the C in the name stood for Crystal Jones, but it
> turned out Crystal Jones was a servant of the Mi-Go. While her brain
> was being transported to Pluto, Left Eye and T-Boz hired a specialist
> to deal with her. Former SAS Leftenant Remo Harris
>
> *Steve:* Okay, wait a second, Crystal Jones was working for the Mi-Go?
> What about Chili?
>
> *Zack:* She is an ancient wizard reconstituted from her salts in a
> ritual conducted by T-Boz. But that\'s not relevant to the plot here,
> the important thing is Left Eye knows and trusts Remo Harris.
