> Yet the decision of web providers yanking services and ejecting Nazi
> scumbags is apparently a controversial and unprecedented issue. It
> would appear that until now, like Trump, internet companies like
> Facebook and Cloudflare have not shared the instinctive moral
> revulsion most Americans, Europeans, and British feel toward white
> supremacists and neo-Nazis. \[\...\]

> It should be noted that press has simultaneously noted that hate
> groups and white supremacist memes \"thrive, even in wide open, public
> communities\" on Facebook. Don\'t worry, it\'s still a clean, well-lit
> place for fascism: Facebook still defends Holocaust denial as free
> speech *as its policy,* despite the fact that it is illegal in 16
> countries because it is linked to violence against Jews. \[\...\]

> The problem is that the same companies we\'re cheering at to take a
> bite out of Nazi privilege and access are the same companies whose
> takedown and censorship processes are muddy \-- which is what gives
> them play to censor people they simply don\'t want on their services.
> Like people who work in the sex industry, and LGBT people, who are
> most often silenced at the censorship end of these policies. One need
> only read the news over the past several years to see that legitimate
> voices get silenced online far more than those of aging skinheads and
> young Nazis.
