> The action of \'playing to win\' is neutralised as she ritualistically
> performs and re-performs her own violent suicide in front of
> disinterested players and characters. At once, an unheard digital cry
> for help against a wall of self-absorbed in-game characters, a martyr
> action of feminist protest against the treatment of her fellow female
> characters in gaming history and a claiming of her own death prior to
> her inevitable violent murder. Ultimately her quest is a futile one,
> not only is her action unregistered and unheard, her reverse gaming
> against her own survival is redundant, as in all gaming, in dying
> there is an automatic digital rebirth. There is no purgatory online,
> she is destined to be eternally punished in a digital hell.
