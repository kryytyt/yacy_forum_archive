``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
pretty large re-design of json no-sql database to prevent storage of
full json in RAM for accounts. This has been replaced with index markers
and file pointers into the json dump files. To make this possible, the
json dump reading process had to be changed in such a way that during
reading the file position is known. The json tool set has been enhanced.
For testing, the junit library has been added.
