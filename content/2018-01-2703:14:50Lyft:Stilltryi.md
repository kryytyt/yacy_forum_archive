Don\'t fool yourself that Lyft is any better than Uber: While Uber is a
12-alarm fratboy dumpster fire of a company, Lyft is still at least a
3-alarm dumpster fire. They don\'t get as much bad press because they
have a smaller market share, and so they make less good click-bait.

Both companies are morally bankrupt. Both companies\' business models
are best described as \"insurance fraud\".
