> Brigadoon isn\'t a love story \-- I mean, it is, of course, because
> it\'s a musical, but it really shouldn\'t be. It\'s a horror movie, a
> grotesquerie, a terrifying sci-fi cautionary tale with extraordinarily
> threatening religious undertones. It shouldn\'t be a lushly produced,
> Vincente Minelli-directed Cinemascope tentpole with an iconic
> Lerner-and-Loewe book and score (respectively), it should be a deeply
> chilling, very special episode of the *Twilight Zone.* \[\...\]
>
> First: Effectively, the residents of Brigadoon are experiencing a
> normal, continuous life, going to bed and then waking up, except that
> when they wake up, it\'s 100 years later than when they fell asleep.
> Where the village goes when it disappears, and whether the residents
> literally sleep for 100 years without aging or whether they in fact
> are in a Brigadoon-effect bubble of time dilation and sleep for just
> one night is unclear, but since the source of the village\'s magic in
> this world is actually, literally, Yaweh the Judeo-Christian god,
> let\'s just wave away the question and file it under \"omnipotence,
> idk.\" Functionally, when you go to sleep in Brigadoon, you wake up a
> century in the future.
>
> Second: If the village was ~~cursed~~ blessed with its time-dilation
> bubble 200 years ago, and it\'s on a century cycle, that means that
> this is only the second time ever that the village has reappeared.
> More to the point, because the Brigadoonians experience time
> continuously, it\'s only two days later for them. The priest prayed
> his magic wish-prayer and it was granted by apparently Loki-Yahweh or
> someone and the entire town is trapped in a time-dilation bubble and
> it\'s ONLY BEEN TWO DAYS and they are all SHOCKINGLY CALM ABOUT THIS
> which is ABSOLUTELY INSANE. \[\...\]
>
> More to the point, though, *how is this nightmare reality in which
> they now live not the entire focus of the story?* \[\...\] It seems to
> me that a foundational allure of creating a world in which magic/weird
> science/God-induced miracles exists would be sitting down and seeing
> what the logical consequences are of your authorial tweak to the
> fabric of reality. (For example, I am constantly annoyed whenever
> characters in stories encounter ghosts or the spirits of dead people,
> and don\'t *immediately* reassess their metaphysical understanding of
> reality, particularly their own corporeal forms, and also just
> completely recalibrate their own fear of death. Wouldn\'t you?)
>
> But seriously. If you\'re going to create a world where an entire town
> of Puritanical eighteenth-century Scots(wo)men have their town
> converted into a forward-motion-only time machine that will, in the
> span of just one year in their eyes, deposit them in the year 38235
> \-- that\'s *thirty-eight thousand two hundred thirty five* \-- in
> what frickin universe does it make any sense whatsoever to make your
> story about a guy one of the village girls develops a crush on, on day
> goddamn *two!?!*
