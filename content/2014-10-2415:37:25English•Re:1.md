English â€¢ Re: 1 of 2 identical machines is incredibly slow
==========================================================

HI & thanks for your thoughts.\
I changed / lowered the JVM to 700 on both machines and restarted.\
The slow machine is still horribly slow.\
I cannot see the difference, though \...perhaps \... a little faster,
not so sluggish. But only \'perhaps.\'\
Sometimes things are faster, sometimes much slower, but always the slow
machine is visibly horribly slow.\
\
Where is the swap file setting, please?\
Is there anything else that can make the machine horrifically slow?\
We do updates and upgrades to the clouds whenever they are available,
though we are only in 12 Ubuntu, upgraded from 10.4\
We discovered the rolling update to 14 is buggy.\
Many thanks
