English â€¢ Greetings, Salutations, & A Plea For Help
===================================================

First off hello, I am happy to be here. I tried messing about with yacy
some time ago, but gave up on it with very little effort. A bit part of
my issue is that I am not much of a joiner and asking for help on forums
is not something I regularly do, but I really like the project and would
love to make a real go of it this time around. My primary aim is to use
yacy as my goto general purpose search engine. With that in mind I have
a few questions.\
\
What are the realistic hardware requirements for this? A lot of the
discussions and tutorials seem to focus on specific use cases.\
\
Are there any simple tricks or tips to improve results and relevance for
general search?\
\
Is there any encryption or anonymity in peer searches? Is any planned?
(that would be great)\
\
Don\'t let the name fool you, I actually try to be kind and courteous
and helpful. I can\'t spend long hours on forums, but I will try to
reply to anything anyone posts here. I may be away from the computer so,
if I don\'t get back right away please accept my apologies in advance
and know that I will as soon as possible. Thanks for any help. Look
forward to hearing from you.
