Hello addiks, I hope it is not a problem if I answer you in English, but
my german level is still too bad\...\
\
It looks like you are using OpenJDK 9, but the currently stable Java
version is 8. Why not trying to launch YaCy with the OpenJDK 8?\
YaCy is developped and tested with Java 7 and Java 8, so using one of
these would increase your chances to launch sucessfully YaCy.\
\
By the way I will have a try with the OpenJDK-9 as soon as I have some
time\...\
\
Best regards
