[Ryan Mungia: *Protect Yourself: Venereal Disease Posters of World War
II*](http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2014/08/15/protect-yourself/)

> The posters scream for themselves. They were the product of
> antagonistic collaboration between the military, the Surgeon
> General\'s office, and the War Advertising Council, a cabal of New
> York admen given the task of fine-tuning American propaganda. The
> near-schizophrenic variety of messages and graphics in this collection
> reflects the internal conflicts of the U.S. propaganda machine, which
> was trying to appease several different agendas simultaneously.
> \[\...\]
>
> Their twisted charisma comes not only from the shocking nature of the
> subject matter, but from the dissonance between message and medium.
> The posters are paragons of graphic design principle \-- but beneath
> their tidy exteriors are convulsions of pure lust and panic.
>
> Propaganda craves the personification of an enemy for its goals.
> \[\...\] They portrayed VD as a colleague of the Axis caricatures, and
> as the creeping specter of the grim reaper. But none of these
> strategies was as arresting as the one that became the hallmark of the
> anti-VD campaign: the personification of sexual disease as the secret
> weapon of womankind.
>
> The military insisted that VD was mainly a symptom of prostitution,
> resulting in multifarious depictions of \"Ladies of the Night.\" Over
> the course of the war, the posters expanded the threat to include
> \"pick-ups,\" \"good-time girls,\" and \"amateurs.\" The escalating
> suspicion climaxed with the most famous VD poster of all, which showed
> the face of a doe-eyed teenager emblazoned with the tagline: \"She May
> Look Clean \-- BUT.\" This was no longer a campaign about disease
> control. Its message was blatant: any woman who displayed an inkling
> of sexual desire was to be viewed as a walking sickness, an enemy of
> the state, and a direct threat to manhood.
