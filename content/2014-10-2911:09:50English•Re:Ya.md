I switched to a VPS on <https://my.vultr.com> for \$8.00 USD/month with
a power saving of approx \$40/month powering my pc at home.\
My Yacy now has an age of 25 days and is 5 GB.\
I read some where if you backup the DATA folder and transfer it to
another machine of a fresh install you have every thing in your index
again, I will have to look into that though.\
I use Debian 7 64bit and have a robot keyboard that types all the
commands in A typical Yacy install takes 4 min.\
