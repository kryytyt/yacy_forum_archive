English â€¢ Yacy on an Olinuxino board
====================================

Date: 2014-10-28 22:34:07

Hi everybody,\
\
I come to you today about running Yacy on Olimex boards. I have been
running Yacy on my laptop for a little time now, but I want to switch to
a permanent and low energy consuming solution in order to index more
pages and have my contribution available at any time. I have experienced
the Olimex Olinuxino board for another project so I figured out that it
could be a good choice to run Yacy 24/7.\
\
However Yacy keeps on crashing on my Olinuxino board. I thought that the
hardware could be the cause, but the board I am using is the A20-LIME2
(dual core A7 at 1GHz with 1GB DDR3) and Yacy is the only app I intend
to run on it, so I guess that the technical specs are sufficient for my
need, since Yacy could be run on less powerful Raspberry Pi systems.\
\
I also noticed (from the log) that Yacy always dies when performing the
action matching the following log line:\
org.apache.solr.update.SolrIndexConfig IndexWriter infoStream solr
logging is enabled\
\
I have seen from my laptop that the next step would be to intialize the
data directories, but these directories do exist on the Olinuxino board
(they are the same as on my laptop, including their permissions).\
\
Right now I am stuck, but I still want to contribute actively to this
very nice project. Hence it would be great if you had any suggestions.\
\
Cheers,
