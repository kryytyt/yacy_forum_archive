> Since the Charlottesville attack a month ago, a review of commentary
> in the six top broadsheet newspapers \-- the Wall Street Journal, New
> York Times, USA Today, LA Times, San Jose Mercury News and Washington
> Post \-- found virtually equal amounts of condemnation of fascists and
> anti-fascist protesters. \[\...\]
>
> While most \"both sides\" columns added a qualifier clarifying that
> there was no moral equivalency between antifa and neo-Nazis, this
> framing could not help but imply that there was. And a few explicitly
> argued that, yes, anti-fascism was just as bad as fascism: \[\...\]
>
> The Washington Post and New York Times published markedly more
> critiques of neo-Nazis than of antifa: the Post by five to two and the
> Times 13 to five. This was in contrast to the coverage in the Wall
> Street Journal \-- five antifa condemnations and no anti-Nazi ones \--
> and USA Today, which featured seven anti-antifa pieces and only three
> opposing white supremacists or calling on Trump to do so. The LA Times
> and Mercury News were basically split down the middle, with the former
> publishing six anti-antifa and five anti-Nazi takes, and the latter
> publishing three against antifa and two against Nazis.
>
> The Wall Street Journal felt compelled to publish five pieces on the
> resistance to resurgent white supremacy \-- without publishing a piece
> criticizing the resurgence of white supremacy itself.
>
> The Wall Street Journal seemed particularly averse to calling out
> Trump for soft-pedaling and dog-whistling white supremacists. A recent
> Guardian expos documented how dozens of writers have left the Journal
> in response to corporate pressure to \"normalize\" the Republican
> president \-- an effort evident in the uniformly positive takes on
> Trump\'s response to Charlottesville.
