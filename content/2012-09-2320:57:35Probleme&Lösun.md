I had a look in my Yacy dir and compared the sourcecode to whats on
gitorious and it seems to be uptodate with the last gitorious commit.\
To me that indicates that I am really running with the \"Fix\", mabye
there is something more that needs to be fixed.\

Hopefully Orbiter has an idea of what is happening.\
