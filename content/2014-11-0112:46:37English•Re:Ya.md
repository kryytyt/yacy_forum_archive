Ask questions in forums that deal with the Olinuxino board. eg
<https://www.olimex.com/forum/>\
Contact Olinuxino Developers also.\
\
Can you unplug your USB Drive and receive the Yacy log files on another
PC?\
If so I suggest you can report a bug report at
<http://mantis.tokeek.de/main_page.php> for future reference.\
Note: After you report a bug you have to view it and then click Monitor
button to get email updates.\

I\'m really interested in it to have approx 1.2 Watt/hour Yacy Search
Engine at home.
