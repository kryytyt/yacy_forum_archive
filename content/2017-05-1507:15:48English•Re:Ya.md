With the amount of RAM you have I guess you can even increase this
value, but that\'s only a supposition : personally I always run YaCy on
mid-range desktop machines or on low-end Virtual Machines so I am not
really experienced with large scale crawls on high performance
servers\...\
But I can say that some months ago I ran successfully some crawls with
100 000 links by crawl start file, needing some days to end, but working
rather well on a machine with only 2GB RAM. I have to admit that I
didn\'t try to restart YaCy while these crawls where running. And I was
not aware that so many files could be created in the QUEUES folder\...
It looks like there is definitely something to do, at least at start to
avoid exhausting the file descriptors made available by the OS.
