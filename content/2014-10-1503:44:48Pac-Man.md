> Locked in a lunatic asylum for many years, Pac-Man swallows many pills
> that give himb the nurses to test the effects of chemical substances
> on his body. Addicted to psychotropic he is fed since childhood,
> Pac-Man has now lost all reason. The spirit of Pac-Man is now locked
> in a madness whose hallucinations make him see ghosts all the colors
> in a labyrinthine nightmare world as it crashes every night screaming
> against the padded wall of his cell.
