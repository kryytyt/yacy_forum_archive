> Virtual rabbits across Second Life will fall asleep on Saturday then
> never wake up, now that the their digital food supply has been shut
> down by a legal battle. The player-made and player-sold Ozimals brand
> of digirabbits are virtual pets that players breed and care for in the
> sandbox MMO, and even need to feed by buying DRM-protected virtual
> food. But they rely on servers. Waypoint reported earlier today that
> the seller of Ozimals and the Pufflings virtuabirds has received a
> legal threat he says he cannot afford to fight, so they\'ve shut down.
> By Saturday, rabbits will run out of food and enter hibernation.
>
> The rabbits aren\'t dead, they\'re sleeping. They simply can never
> wake up.
>
> \[\...\] At least the Ozimals\' birdy cousins, the Pufflings, had a
> swift death. They shut down instantly on Wednesday when the servers
> went down, while rabbits hold on with the food in their cyberbellies.
>
> Ozimals did give rabbit owners a brief chance to save their rabbits.
> Before shutting down, they gave away items which make rabbits not need
> food \-- and leaves them sterile. Some rabbits will live on forever,
> the last of their kind. If you wish that fate upon your rabbit,
> apparently some kindly players have a stash you\'re welcome to.

Your DRM-addicted pet bunny can be like [Cancer Puppy from *The
Magicians!*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqCZXVSLFEw) It can spent
eternity with its viscera riddled through with botnets and blockchains!
