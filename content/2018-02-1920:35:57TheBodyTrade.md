> MedCure shipments are now the subject of a federal investigation. In
> November, the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the company\'s
> Portland headquarters. Though the search warrant remains sealed,
> people familiar with the matter say it relates in part to overseas
> shipping. \[\...\]
>
> In 2012, MedCure opened its European hub in Amsterdam. Since then,
> MedCure has sent to the Netherlands at least six refrigerated cargo
> containers filled with frozen human remains, manifest records show.
> The first container \-- 40 feet long, 8 feet wide, 9.5 feet tall \--
> departed the Port of Tacoma in Washington state in July 2012. The body
> parts weighed about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg) and were valued at
> \$259,210. \[\...\]
>
> On November 1, as Daniel Gallegos\' head and the heads of six other
> donors were returning from Israel to UTN in Arizona for cremation,
> someone noticed a discrepancy on the shipping documents. According to
> records reviewed by Reuters, the shipping manifest described the
> contents as \"electronics\" valued at \$10 each. A label on the
> coffin-sized package described the contents as human remains.
>
> Government records show that border officials were troubled that the
> package appeared punctured and a strong smell was wafting from the
> box. They also demanded death certificates to ensure that the
> specimens were disease-free, records show. One of the donors, records
> show, carried staphylococcus aureus, an infection the CDC website says
> poses a potentially serious risk to healthcare workers.
