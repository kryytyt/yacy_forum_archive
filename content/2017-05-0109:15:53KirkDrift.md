> There is no other way to put this: essentially everything about
> Popular Consciousness Kirk is bullshit. Kirk, as received through mass
> culture memory and reflected in its productive imaginary (and
> subsequent franchise output, including the reboot movies), has little
> or no basis in Shatner\'s performance and the television show as
> aired. Macho, brash Kirk is a mass hallucination.

> I\'m going to walk through this because it\'s important for ST:TOS\'s

> watching* through the haze of bullshit that is the received idea of
> what they\'re seeing. You \"know\" Star Trek before you ever see Star
> Trek: a \'naive\' encounter with such a culturally cathected text is
> almost impossible, and even if you manage it you probably also have
> strong ideas about that period of history, era of SF, style of
> television, etc to contend with.
