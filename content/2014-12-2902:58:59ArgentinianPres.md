[Being Godfather to
Werewolves.](http://www.werewolfpage.com/myths/global_legends.html)

> In the early 1900s the legend of the 7th son transforming himself into
> a werewolf was so widespread and believed that it was causing a lot of
> children to be abandoned or given away for adoption, and it is said
> that in some cases the parents killed their own son. Because of this,
> the president passed a law in the 1920s by which the 7th son of a
> family automatically receives the godfathership of the president of
> Argentina! Through this, the state gives him a gold medal on the day
> of his baptism (when the president officially becomes his godfather)
> and a scholarship for all of his studies until his 21st birthday.
> Supposedly, this ended the phenomenon of people condemning their
> children for fear of the werewolf. The law is still in effect, and it
> is popularly known, and the presidents have always attended at least
> some of the baptisms, especially during election season.

*Werewolf scholarships. Not to be confused with the Chewbacca Defense.*
