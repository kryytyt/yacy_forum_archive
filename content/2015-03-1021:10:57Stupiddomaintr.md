I wondered what other animal TLDs exist besides
**[.horse](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/03/walmart-horse-is-an-actual-domain/):**
Only
**[.fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains)**!
Not even
**[.gopher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_%28protocol%29)**!

But reading through [the
list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#ICANN-era_generic_top-level_domains),
I see that **.bar** exists, and some domain-squatting company in Mexico
has registered **[foo.bar](http://foo.bar/)** \-- well played, seÃ±or \--
though it doesn\'t point anywhere \-- [*boo*](http://boo.boo/).

I\'m somewhat offended that Google has squatted
**[.foo](http://icannwiki.com/index.php/.foo)** for themselves. They
have some dumb thing at [**bar.foo**](http://bar.foo/). I\'ll bet
they\'re pissed that someone snagged **[foo.bar](http://foo.bar/)**
before them. \<nelson\>*Ha ha.*\</nelson\>.

But I am *really* happy to report that the guy who, back in 1994, had
control of the [**foo\@bar.com**](mailto:foo@bar.com) email address [has
it back again!](http://bar.com/) For some time there, this important
relic of history [was lost to
us](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2002/09/how-sad/).

Speaking of **.bar**, there\'s **.beer** and **.vodka** but no other
boozes.

I actually laughed out loud when I saw that the purpose of **.ninja** is
\"general expertise\". Then I realized they didn\'t mean *actual* ninjas
and general expertise in ninja-ing, they really just mean *douchebags*,
and then I got really sad.

Nobody has registered [betty.archi or
veronica.archi](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/08/afterlife-with-archie/).

**.wang** exists, but not **.boobies** or **.poop** or **.ðŸ’©**, which I
think would be spelled **.xn\--ls8h**. See also [Poopla,
**ðŸ’©.la**](http://xn--ls8h.la/). And though **.la** is maybe not what you
think,
**[.nyc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#North_America)**
is, but there is no **.sf**.

Even though this proliferation of TLDs is completely stupid, I\'m glad
that **.fail** exists, just so that I can point out that
[**tld.fail**](http://tld.fail/) does not exist but should.
