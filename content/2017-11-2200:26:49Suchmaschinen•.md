<http://snipesearch.co.uk> for years we used a different indexer. I
discovered yacy about a month back, installed it on a 32 core 128GB ram
blade with a 512GB SSD and took it for atest drive, it indexed at a rate
supremely faster than anything else we ever tried. Yesterday we switched
the site over to yacy and its already reached 800k pages in its local
index. I\'m very impressed with the script (im sharing the index in the
freeworld) and will be adding new blades as each one fills up.
