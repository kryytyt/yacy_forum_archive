[Upgrading a Vectrex to 32
Bits](http://www.galacticstudios.org/vectrex32smartcart/)

So basically: he took the 1982-vintage Vectrex and wrote a cartridge for
it that turns it into a simple I/O device, with the real program running
elsewhere. But, to avoid letting things get *too* modern, he made the
controlling computer (which also fits inside the cartridge) be of
1992-vintage instead of something modern.

Today I learned that BASIC can have breakpoints. Apparently these
neo-retro BASICs have advanced beyond what I\'m used to: when
`CLOADMÂ $C000` fails because your cassette stretched, you just type it
all in again.

I feel like this must have been what game development was like during
those heady, accelerating days toward the end of the
[19A0s](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2012/10/19a0/).
