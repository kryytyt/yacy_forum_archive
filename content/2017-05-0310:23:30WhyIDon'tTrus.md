you live in a city of
villains.](http://uncannymagazine.com/article/city-villains-dont-trust-batman/)

> Your city has a billionaire playboy. He lives on top of the hill. You
> don\'t know much about him, other than what you read in the papers
> about his romantic exploits and elaborate black-tie parties. You had a
> gig once offloading decorative antique suits of armor at his mansion
> up on the hill. You wanted to sign up for the gig offloading slabs of
> marble to be installed in his ballroom, but you hurt your back and got
> fired.
>
> You met the billionaire playboy once. You grew up in one of his
> orphanages, after your Pop was killed by a villain and your Ma ran off
> to make her fortune robbing banks in a souped-up mech suit. The
> orphanage was nice, nicer than home even, because nobody there was
> squirreling away your lunch money to pay for mech suit parts. You met
> the billionaire playboy when he came through the orphanage to inspect
> the place. There was a woman with a clipboard trailing behind him, and
> she smiled at you. The billionaire ran his hands across the rows of
> bedposts and looked into the distance, and you couldn\'t catch his
> eye.
>
> After you hurt your back, your buddy tells you about a job he\'s got
> working in-house security at some guy\'s warehouse downtown. You live
> downtown. It would be nice to work close to where you live \-- you
> wouldn\'t have to sit on the half-the-time-broke-down trolley that
> goes from just outside the slums to the canning district, which is
> your other employment option.
>
> The billionaire playboy owns a lot of real estate in the city. That,
> you learn through your buddy as you walk together to the security job,
> is how the billionaire playboy\'s family amassed their fortune. They
> owned all the land before the city became a bustling urban metropolis.
>
> You\'re not sure whether he owns the slum where you live. You wonder
> if your rent money pays for decorative antique suits of armor.
