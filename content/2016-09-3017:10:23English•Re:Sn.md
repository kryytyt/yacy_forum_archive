================================

Hi Alex,\
snippets are generated in different places, an some have definitely a
fixed maximum size not configurable in the current YaCy :\
- when no snippet was provided by local or remote Solr engine, YaCy
tries to generate snippets on its own, with a hard-coded maximum size :
see
[SearchEvent](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/Release_1.90/source/net/yacy/search/query/SearchEvent.java#L1355){.postlink}
and constant
[SearchEvent.SNIPPET\_MAX\_LENGTH](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/Release_1.90/source/net/yacy/search/query/SearchEvent.java#L125){.postlink}\
- as far as I know, with results from remote YaCy portal peers, snippets
will be generated by remote Solr, but you won\'t have control over their
size as it is configured on the remote Solr\
- the only case when you may be able to configure your peer (note I
didn\'t tested this on mine) for a longer snippet size is probably in
your local Solr configuration : see the [related
section](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/Release_1.90/defaults/solr/solrconfig.xml#L1375){.postlink}
in the default Solr Config and [Solr
Wiki](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HighlightingParameters){.postlink}nstructions
for example.\
