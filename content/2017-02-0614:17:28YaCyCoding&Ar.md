[DuckDuckGo has some interesting
documentation](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy#s1){.postlink} about
various methods of hiding this private data.\
\
DuckDuckGo\'s solution is to implement a redirect, which is its own
privacy problem if you don\'t trust DuckDuckGo\'s server not to spy on
you. However, I don\'t think this is really a problem for YaCy, since
it\'s just trusting a locally running free software application that you
can inspect to make sure it\'s not doing something sketchy.\
\
According to [a WordPress plugin\'s
documentation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/noreferrer/){.postlink},
rel=\"noreferrer\" is supported by Firefox since version 33 and Chromium
since 2009. Referrer policy meta elements are supported by Firefox since
version 37 and Chromium since 2011. [Mozilla\'s
documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types){.postlink}
says that Firefox prior to version 37 incorrectly handled
rel=\"noreferrer\". This means that the Firefox ESR releases (upon which
Tor Browser is based) and the \~1.5-year-old Chromium releases (upon
which Replicant WebView is based) should handle both of them without
trouble. (I haven\'t tested this myself.)\

(Coincidentally, this topic came up a few days ago on \#yacy on
Freenode. Cool to see that you\'ve been thinking about this topic too.
