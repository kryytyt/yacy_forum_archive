English â€¢ Loader and file size limits
=====================================

Date: 2014-12-27 08:49:17

Hi guys\
\
I\'ve just noticed that after starting crawling there are large files
being downloaded (these can be observed under \"Crawler Monitor\" -\>
\"Processing Monitor\"/\"Loader\") which seem to exceed file size
limits. I\'ve checked limits under \"System Administration\" -\>
\"Advanced Settings\" -\> \"Crawler Settings\" and these are:\

-   HTTP Crawler Settings: 10485760
-   FTP Crawler Settings: 10485760
-   SMB Crawler Settings: 100000000
-   Local File Crawler Settings: 100000000

\
For example, I\'ve observed following file being downloaded:
[http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stab \...
d.mpkg.zip](http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable/bin/swi-prolog-5.10.0-snow-leopard.mpkg.zip){.postlink}\
HTTP response for this file returns Content-Length:\"12026535\" which is
bigger than Yacy HTTP file size limit (10485760).\
I have also seen 400Mb+ files being downloaded.\
\
Could you please clarify whether this is a bug (I will create ticket in
bugtracker then) or I am just missing something. Could you please also
explain what is a Loader in Yacy terminology (is that just an additional
queue for large binary files that runs in parallel with crawler?)
