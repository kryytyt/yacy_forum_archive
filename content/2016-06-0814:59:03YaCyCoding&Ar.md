absolute numbers are misleading becuase the absolute number of harvested
messages is very different over time. I. e. there may be 200 million
messages on total for one month, and then 100 million another month. To
normalize this, the best approach is to compute a likelihood to click on
a specific domain if all the links are available for a random click in a
specific time windows. Then different time frames can be compared.\
Thats the same approach google does if they compute the page rank: not
the absolute number of referrences but the likelihood to reach a
specific page if a user clicks randomly.
