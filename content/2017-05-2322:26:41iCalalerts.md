iCal alerts
===========

![](https://www.jwz.org/images/clown-computing.png)Dear Lazyweb, my iCal
alerts have started randomly not showing up. WTF?

I use Apple Calendar on my desktop Mac and sync it through iCloud with
my phone and iPad. It used to be that when an alarm went off, a
notification showed up on all three devices. If you were lucky,
dismissing it on one device would also dismiss it on the others.

But now the notification seems to be showing up on only *one* device.

For example: I was active at my desktop when the alarm should have gone
off. Nothing. I looked at my phone, which had been locked for an hour:
nothing there. I looked at my iPad, which had been locked for 12 hours:
*OH THERE IT IS.* How helpful.

Is this the new normal, or am I just lucky?

Anyone know what to do to fix this shit?
