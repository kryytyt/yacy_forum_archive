I understand that this is probably a recognized and uncared for
problem.\
But just to byte the procrastination indolence and resurrect the
problem, the forum should probably not be in German.\
\
The project put great care on maximizing the aesthetic presentation of
YaCy and the website, with graphics, videos and immersive tutorials.\
Having the forum in German ruins the image of YaCy IMHO, and incentives
the growth of a localized German community while deterring the
formation, or growth, of a larger international community.\
Keeping one small subsection of the forum for collecting the posts from
\"[just all the other folks who don\'t speak our beloved
Deutsch]{style="font-style: italic"}\" is not beneficial, to my view, to
the growth of the project.\
\
What do you think?
