well, the decision does very well use the definition of access rules to
http services and proxy services, both use the same GET command with all
the http properties attached, the ONLY difference is, that after the GET
comes a single path if that is an access to a web server and a complete
URL if that access is an access to a http proxy. This difference is so
easy to detect that it would be absurd to open for that an extra port
and a whole new server.\

- what kind of client do you use to access YaCy (i.e. which browser?)\

I believe the problem comes from the fact that you configured a proxy in
your browser. If so, just switch that off.
