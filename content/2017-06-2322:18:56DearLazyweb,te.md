Or, \"Old Man Yells at Cloud Hosting\".

Currently I host all of my various web sites and services (business and
personal) on a single physical Linux box leased from a small ISP.
That\'s been working out fine for me for many years. However, of late my
ISP has become so non-responsive to support requests that I can\'t
interpret that any way other than, \"We are no longer interested in
being an ISP\".

So, sadly, I think I need to find new hosting.

My initial instinct, because I am an unfrozen caveman, and your modern
ways frighten and confuse me, is to find someone else to rent me a 1U
server. But those appear to be nearly nonexistent these days, because in
this modern world, That Is Simply Not Done.

(And though there are a few companies that do this, the fact that there
are so few makes me suspect that they won\'t be in business at all a
couple years from now.)

So I\'m looking at virtualization options from Amazon and Digital Ocean
and whatnot, and it\'s all very confusing. In particular, figuring out
how much my performance, storage and bandwidth requirements are
*actually going to cost* is absurdly complicated.

Here\'s what I have now, that I need to replace with
equivalent-or-better:

-   8 core 2GHz (faster would be nice)
-   32 GB RAM
-   2 TB disk
-   a backup of that disk
-   Outbound bandwidth: 2 TBytes / month

Right now I\'m paying \$300 / month for that.

So it looks to me like Digital Ocean and Amazon are the closest
replacements for that, but it\'s hard to tell. I *think* that the
closest options are:

-   [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/): Their \$240
    option (32 GB RAM, 4 core, 90 GB storage, 7TB transfer) looks close,
    but that\'s not nearly enough storage, and they charge \$100/TB, so
    that brings it to \$440/month. Also they don\'t specify how fast
    those cores are.
-   [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/pricing/):
    The m4.2large option (32 GB RAM, 8 core, no storage) looks close, at
    \$258 (paid a year in advance); plus 2TB storage at \$200/month. So
    that puts us at \$458/month already. They also don\'t specify core
    speed, and that\'s for 1Gbps, and if I\'m doing my math right,
    2TB/month is 6.1Mbps, and I can\'t even tell what they charge for
    that.

It blows my mind how much they want to charge for disk. I can buy a
physical 2TB drive that will last 5+ years for \$80, but these jokers
want me to pay \$200/month for that. That is a markup of 150x! What the
hell!

Options I am not interested in:

-   Try to get 2TB of bandwidth into the DNA Lounge building and manage
    my own high availability data center, for a single server.
-   Rewrite 20+ years of code that is in a variety of languages into
    whatever toy-du-jour Google insists things be written in to take
    advantage of their hosting option.
-   \"Virtual hosts are great because when you realize you need more,
    you can instantly upgrade them and start paying more!\" I know this
    excites many of you, so much, but this feature is completely
    uninteresting to me because my requirements are static and because I
    prefer to know what I\'m paying ahead of time.
-   Also, just to head this off too: I realize that many people are of
    the opinion, \"You should run each web site, and each service, on
    its own virtual server\", and while that sounds sensible to me in
    principle, it sounds less good when each of those virtual servers is
    an additional \$250/month. At that price, I\'ll run all of my sites
    out of the same Apache instance, thanks.

So what should I do?
