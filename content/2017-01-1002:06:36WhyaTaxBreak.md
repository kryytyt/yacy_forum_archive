> Law enforcement agencies around the country have been expanding their
> surveillance capabilities by recruiting private citizens and
> businesses to share their security camera footage and live feeds. The
> trend is alarming, since it allows government to spy on communities
> without the oversight, approval, or legal processes that are typically
> required for police.
>
> EFF is opposing new legislation introduced in California by
> Assemblymember Marc Steinorth that would create a tax credit worth up
> to \$500 for residents who purchase home security systems, including
> fences, alarms and cameras. In a letter, EFF has asked the lawmaker to
> strike the tax break for surveillance cameras, citing privacy concerns
> as well as the potential threat created by consumer cameras that can
> be exploited by botnets.
