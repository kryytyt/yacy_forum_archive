English â€¢ RSS feeds not processing correctly
============================================

Date: 2014-12-26 20:56:56

in YaCy version 1.81/9319\
\
A fresh cloud installation, only a few days old, and normally very
fast.\
All pages are functioning properly, however, except for [Content
Importer]{style="font-weight: bold"} \>
[Load\_RSS\_p.html]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
\
That page displays properly, at first.\
at the promot\

> <div>
>
> \
> URL of the RSS feed\
>
> </div>

\
We add a known, functional and valid RSS address. It very slowly loads
the header lines - and sometimes takes 2-3 minutes. The browser reports
\'it is waiting\' for the IP address of the server\
Normally, below the header lines are the instructions about crawl
frequency and below that are the individual pages identified in the
RSS.\
However, no lines display. This means there are no articles to include
or not include.\
Example:\

> <div>
>
> \
> RSS Feed of <https://xyz>\
> Titleifrs org - xxxx AuthorDescription\[yyy
> feed\]LanguageDateTime-to-liveDocs\
> StateTitleURLAuthorLanguageDateDescription\
>
> </div>

\
\
Below this there should be selectable articles.\
However there are none. It is the end of the page.\
\
How to correct this, please?\
Many thanks.
