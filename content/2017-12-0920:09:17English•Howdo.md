English â€¢ How does the yacy web server work?
============================================

Date: 2017-12-09 20:09:17

I have experience only with Apache.\
\
When installing yacy I left the port by default, it is a public
instance, for the moment we have shared the url \"ip+port\".\
Now I have the following problem, many people already use the url
<http://37.228.132.249:8090/> so it should keep working, but in reality
to point to a domain or subdomain I need yacy to be in port 80 what can
I do?
