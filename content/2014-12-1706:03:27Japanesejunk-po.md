> A pensioner who dumped almost a quarter of a tonne of pornography in a
> Japanese park is unlikely to be charged, police said Tuesday, because
> the stash belonged to an ill friend.
>
> Hideaki Adachi was spotted unloading 17 sacks of films and magazines,
> which included around 500 VHS video tapes, from the back of a truck at
> a small park in the western Japanese city of Osaka.
>
> \"He wanted to get rid of them out of goodwill for his friend,\" a
> spokesman said.
>
> Adachi, who worked as a volunteer in the park helping homeless people,
> had hoped that the huge collection of adult materials would be picked
> up and taken to a proper disposal site.
