=================================================

Date: 2014-09-19 03:35:06

I have win 2003 and have ended up putting my FTP server directory in my
web server directory structure so the seed.txt has a URL. I have
downloaded seed.txt from a few sites on
<http://www.yacy-websuche.de/wiki/index.php/Seedlists>.\
Even tried different browsers. What am I doing wrong, Thanks in
advance.\
\
After submitting new config the error msg.\
\
Seed Settings changed, but something is wrong.\
SaveSeedList: Seed upload failed (IO error): UPLOAD CHECK - Error: the
result vector is different. Element at position 0 is different. \<br\>\
\
Update I used Store to file system see below.\
\
My settings\

\
Store to file system option does give good example of path because you
have to add the file name as well. Solved\
