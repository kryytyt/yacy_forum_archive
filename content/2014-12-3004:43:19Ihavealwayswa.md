[![](http://www.jwz.org/images/psychology-experiment-ft.jpg)Cyranoids
are people who do not speak thoughts originating in their own central
nervous system.](http://www.wired.com/2014/09/cyranoid-experiment/)

> Their findings suggest people fall for it pretty hard. The cyranoid

> professor, played by Gillespie, switched roles. Subjects thought the
> man seemed a bit dim for an adult living in Britain \-- he botched a
> question about Margaret Thatcher and was unable to list the country\'s

> suspected his answers weren\'t his own.

> But that\'s increasingly not the case, Bailenson says. \"What\'s
