this shows that there is no YaCy-specific problem on that second server.
If this runs \'in a cloud\' then possibly the second server is probably
just hosted on a machine which has busy VM vom other users.\
\
The \"The peer must go online to get a peer address.\" is maybe caused
my recent IPv6 changes, I believe its just a wrong message, not a real
communication error. I am not monitoring any \'massive failure\' due to
recent release changes. Please report detailed observations which can be
used to track down what you name \'massive failure\'. From the
information you gave so far there is no problem solving possible.
