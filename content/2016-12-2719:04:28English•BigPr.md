English â€¢ Big Probleme With yacy installation on debian
=======================================================

Date: 2016-12-27 19:04:28

I\'ve said i\'ve installed yacy on a debian server and since 3 ou 4
days, it\'s said me yacy can\'t be reached via port 8090, but before it
worked good and i\'ve not changed anything to configuration:\
<http://109.238.10.103:8090/index.html>\
\
Finally i\'ve found the problem, i\'ve set the option to protect all
pages but it protect the search page too, i want protect all systems
page, not the public search page ! Is there an option for that only ?\
\
\
And a big problem, i\'ve tried to change option to \"search portal for
your own web pages\" and it unload all page crawled, i\'ve changed again
to Community-based web search and it show me millions of urls but the
problem is now that yacy don\'t find anything often and it take one
minute or more to show search page ?! What is the problem ? Before when
i search for \"alice miller\" (i\'ve crawled website
<http://alice-miller.com/>) if find without problem links but not now,
last search it show me nothing :\
[http://109.238.10.103:8090/yacysearch.h \...
Offset=-60](http://109.238.10.103:8090/yacysearch.html?query=alice+miller&Enter=&contentdom=text&former=alice+miller&maximumRecords=20&startRecord=0&verify=ifexist&resource=loca:l&nav=location%2Cfiletype%2Cprotocol%2Chosts%2Clanguage%2Cauthors%2Cnamespace%2Ctopics&prefermaskfilter=&depth=0&constraint=&meanCount=5&timezoneOffset=-60){.postlink}\
\
Same problem with \"laine de bois\" (french word for isolation tool) , a
few days before it find links but nothing now\
[http://109.238.10.103:8090/yacysearch.h \...
Offset=-60](http://109.238.10.103:8090/yacysearch.html?query=laine+de+bois&Enter=&verify=ifexist&contentdom=text&nav=location%2Cfiletype%2Cprotocol%2Chosts%2Clanguage%2Cauthors%2Cnamespace%2Ctopics&startRecord=0&indexof=off&meanCount=5&resource=global&prefermaskfilter=&maximumRecords=20&timezoneOffset=-60){.postlink}\
\
And why it\'s soo slow, my server is 2To , 6gb for yacy memory and it
never do more than 200 or 300 page maximum / minute ?
