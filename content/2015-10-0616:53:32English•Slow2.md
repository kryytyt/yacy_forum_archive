English â€¢ Slow 2 X AMD Opteron 2373 Quadcore 2,1Ghz 64GB server
===============================================================

Date: 2015-10-06 16:53:32

Hi.\
\
I am running a server with 2 X AMD Opteron 2373 Quadcore 2,1Ghz (8 cores
in total) and 64 GB of ram mostly dedicated to Yacy (16GB of ram for
yacy) and I have been doing a few tweaks here and there to try and get
it up to speed with no luck.\
OS : Ubuntu 14.04 Server\
\
Main issue right now is that I a only getting \~500 ppm whilst my CPU;s
are almost maxed out, that can\'t be right?\
\
Anyone out there with some suggestions of where things might have gone
wrong?
