[Have you ever wondered what would happen if a \'Cinemax After Dark\'
special, a James Bond movie, the Guy On Hollywood Boulevard Whose Whole
Body Is Covered In Gold Paint, and the gnawing emptiness of late-stage
capitalism screwed in the backseat of a very high-end car and then gave
birth to a three-minute Red Band trailer for, um, a
house?](http://laist.com/2017/05/05/soft_core_home.php)

> Well, WONDER NO MORE, for this has happened:
>
> Yes, the above is a \"trailer\" for Opus, a \$100 million \"state of
> the art dream home\" currently for sale in Los Angeles. We \"wanted to
> do something really high art,\" a spokesperson for the home told LAist
> in reference to the short film. The house has Roberto Cavalli
> flooring, a 15-seat curved screen theater with JBL Synthesis Audio,
> two massive bars \-- one of which has a \"Winestation\" that preserves
> and dispenses glasses with the exact amount and temperature desired
> \-- a gourmet show kitchen with an iPad-controlled coffee machine,
> Longhi doors in suede and embossed leather, and a separate
> catering/event kitchen.
>
> The video begins with a shot of the giant, looming \"O\" that stands
> in front of the house, presumably in reference to Opus, the home\'s
> name \[\...\] JK! The \"O\" irrefutably stands for \"orgasm,\" which
> is what a human being would have every minute of every day if they had
> \$100 million to spare on a sex home.
