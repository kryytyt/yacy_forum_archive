> Drive the demons from the NSA data collection building known as
> \"Titanpointe\"! Mass exorcism ritual to purify data, reject false
> gods\... and defend freedom of thought!
>
> In the interests of metaphysically purging the edifice of the data it
> hoards and invoking a less maniacal version of citizen-government
> relations, on April 15th at 12 p.m. a cadre of priests, supplicants,
> and a volunteer choir affiliated with The Quiet American will exorcise
> the malevolent energy coursing through the so-called \'Long Lines
> Building\' at 33 Thomas Street. This sacred day falls approximately
> one day before the rising of Christ, and three days before tax day.
>
> Beginning with a prayer for the building\'s physical materials and an
> invocation of the gods this architectural fiasco has insulted,
> exorcisors will then lay a perimeter of salt around the building to
> render ineffective the sinister frequencies it broadcasts. In a rite
> of liberation and fertility, thousands of pages of personal data,
> bouquets of flowers, and an ostrich egg will then be sacrificed to the
> building, thereby triggering a massive spiritual data hemorrhage that
> will release the banal facts of our lives back into their proper home
> - the ether \-- and expel the demons of fear and suspicion from the
> temple.
>
> Windowless, monolithic, and creepy as all hell, the building at 33
> Thomas Street is an altar to a false god, a monument to the bottomless
> fear that locks us in permanent war and makes us suspicious of our
> neighbors, our own towns and cities, our own capabilities and
> impulses. Windowless, shuttered to the world that it is intended to
> spy on, the building at 33 Thomas Street is a maelstrom of negative
> energy, a black hole that sucks up light in the form of our personal
> communications, then in some alchemical sleight of hand returns that
> light in the form of a panic and dread which we are assured is the
> real common currency of our civic life. Rather than allay fears of the
> end however, this brutalist heap - designed to withstand a nuclear
> assault and sustain the employees working within its bowels for two
> weeks - broadcasts paranoia.
