English â€¢ How To Become A Node Candidate
========================================

Date: 2014-02-24 20:21:13

I\'ve installed Yacy on a Debian 7 server. It\'s got 12GB RAM and 250GB
HDD. I\'d like to just let this server run and help the network as much
as possible. Dedicated IP address, and tons of bandwidth.\
\
What are the settings I need to set/enable to do this?\
\
Also, how can I become a \'node candidate\'? What is this?\
\
Thanks.
