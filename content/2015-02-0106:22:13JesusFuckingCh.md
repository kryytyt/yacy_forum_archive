Jesus Fucking Christ, iTunes.

This is a new one. This time it randomly decided that only *most* of my
music is now Other.

Are there any tools that will let me diddle the phone to turn Other back
into Audio without deleting and re-syncing it all?

Failing that, I am now accepting suggestions for ways to sync MP3 files
from a Mac to an iPhone without going through iTunes or iCloud or any
other cloud service, and without jailbreaking. Does that exist? (If you
are thinking of suggesting something that does not precisely match all
of those criteria, please don\'t.)
