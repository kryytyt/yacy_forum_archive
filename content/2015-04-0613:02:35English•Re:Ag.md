Twitter has the annoying habit of sending a page in the language that is
specified in the \"Accept-Language\" request-header. Which means that if
you crawl the same Twitter-URL with different languages listed in the
accept-language request-header, you will get different results.\
\
This may be nice if a page is requested with an actual browser, but can
be really confusing if you do this with a crawler.
