I mention this often, but I strongly object to the fact that the
Transamerica Pyramid does not come to an actual *point*. Talk about
taking your eye off the prize. They follow the line of the building up
past the topmost \"real\" floor with this hollow, 100 foot tall placebo
atop the building \-- but they don\'t follow it the rest of the way! It
stops with a 10 foot platform. They should have kept going \-- the top
of that building should be sharp enough that you can *spear an olive* on
it. It should be sufficiently architecturally, geometrically honest that
it\'s tip can *draw blood*.

Speaking of which. From *Bloodsucking Fiends* by Christopher Moore:

> Emperor Norton winked, spun on one heel, and started to lead his
> troops away, then stopped and turned back. \"And, son, don\'t touch
> anything with an edge while you\'re in the building? Scissors, letter
> openers, anything.\"
>
> \"Why?\" Tommy asked.
>
> \"It\'s the shape of the building, a pyramid. They\'d rather people
> not know about it, but they have a full-time employee who just goes
> around dulling the letter openers.\"
>
> \"You\'re kidding.\"
>
> \"Safety first,\" the Emperor said.
