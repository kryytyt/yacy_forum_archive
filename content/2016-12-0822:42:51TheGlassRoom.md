This exhibit looks fun, but the ironic thing about this article \-- this
article about surveillance and privacy \-- is that it uses one of those
Javascript libraries that tracks *every mouse click you make* to deliver
statistics back to the site about which pieces of text were highlighted
most often.

Is that still ironic? Or is it just obligatory? I can\'t even tell any
more.

Remember when the web was functional with Javascript turned off? Yeah,
neither do I.

\"This web site requires that your eyes remain open for the duration of
the commercial.\" I think I might have seen a TV show about that.
