The Library of Babel, again
===========================

I\'m still messing around with floor plans of [*The Library of
Babel*](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/10/the-library-of-babel/), and if
you are asking yourself, *\"Why is he doing this?\"* then you and I have
that in common.

An idea I had was that if the \"gallery\" and the \"alcove\" were both
laid out on hexagons of the same size, it makes things pack better \--
or at least makes the voids between galleries always be hexagonal,
instead of other weird shapes, and that pleases me.

Here are two contradictory phrases that occur in the text \"narrow
corridor\" and \"spiral staircase\". Spiral staircases are *huge*. They
have to be. That\'s kind of their *thing*. So I tried to pack things
down by putting the staircase off-center, walled off, and that works out
ok, except it adds packing constraints: the stairway no longer lines up
if the alcoves above or below this one has been rotated. So that
severely limits the variety of layouts available.

And here are a bunch of them, all aimed in the same direction, because
the two doors on each gallery are opposite each other:

So maybe that wasn\'t such a good idea. So I went back to a central,
symmetrical spiral staircase. Here\'s what that looks like, with every
room having a 101110 layout, creating six-gallery loops:

And here are three floors of it: to make this connect, each spiral
staircase would span two floors:

If you want to play around with other layouts, here\'s my Sketchup file:
