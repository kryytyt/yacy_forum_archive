> Fine: I don\'t tend to make a point of parading around my naked

> irretrievably lost. With only that hole remaining the condition of
> humanity must always be one of absolute disconnection; we\'ve been
> snipped apart from a primal unity, and it\'s not coming back until the
> day we die. Our genitals tell us that we can bring ourselves together,
> and even create something new; our navels whisper bitterly that we
> will always be alone. In the enlightened society of the future, they
> will always be covered; the belly button more than deserves its share
> of the socially mandated shame that somehow bypasses it in its mad
> rush southwards from nipples to pudenda. But it\'s not just that. The
> navel marks a person as a created being; by feigning for so long to be
> without one Taylor Swift is positioning herself as a human
> acheiropoieton, something outside the dreary chain of reproductive

> All this, she said, was the work of none other than the award-winning
