YaCy Coding & Architektur â€¢ Chrome extension
============================================

Date: 2014-02-14 13:34:32

Hi everyone,\
\
I started some months ago an extension for chrome using bootstrap +
angularjs. At the moment I added ability like in firefox extension to
blacklist, crawl and search. It\'s not yet completely finished but I
wanted some feedback and wanted to know if you like it, if I have to
continue and what you want inside. I\'m going to put it on github if you
agree with that.\
\
Here you can find this extension : <http://ao0xck3gzo.1fichier.com/>\
\
To use search you have to write in address bar \"yacy\" and type what
keyword you want to search, other features are easy to use so I don\'t
give details.
