> The team developed an ingestible electronic capsule to monitor gas
> levels in the human gut. When it\'s paired with a pocket-sized
> receiver and a mobile phone app, the pill reports tail-wind conditions
> in real time as it passes from the stomach to the colon. \[\...\] Such
> fume data could clarify the conditions of each section of the gut,
> what microbes are up to, and which foods may cause problems in the
> system. Until now, collecting such data has been a challenge. Methods
> to bottle it involved cumbersome and invasive tubing and inconvenient
> whole-body calorimetry.
