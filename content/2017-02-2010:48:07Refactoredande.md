Refactored and enforced Solr mandatory fields for proper operation

- Added a new method to check activation of mandatory fields on
Collection Configuration commit, consistently with checks previously
performed in Switchboard startup and with mandatory fields in the
default schema.
- Reorganized default schema and CollectionConfiguration enumeration :
moved no more mandatory fields in a specific section, and moved fields
enabled at startup to the mandatory section. 
- Marked mandatory fields as required and with stronger font in the
IndexSchema_p.html page
```
