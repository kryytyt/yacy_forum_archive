> Fans of the annual master class in strategic shell and sequin
> placement that is the Coney Island Mermaid Parade can help keep the
> 35th annual event afloat this year: organizers confirmed today that
> they are crowdfunding to make sure the June 17th parade can go on.
>
> The fundraising campaign, dubbed [Feed the
> Mermaids](https://app.mobilecause.com/vf/Mermaid), will help cover the
> cost of logistics and security, as well as city permits, insurance,
> porta potties, tents, and trucks, according to the nonprofit arts
> organization Coney Island USA. As of this writing, \$396 of the
> requested \$50,000 goal has been raised.
>
> Coney Island USA, which also operates the Coney Island Circus
> Sideshow, Burlesque at the Beach, and the Coney Island Museum,
> experienced some \"fairly serious financial crisis events\" in recent
> months, according to director James Fitzsimmons. The parade has
> operated at a loss for years, and this year is facing higher permit
> and insurance costs. The organization\'s core staff of five people was
> let go this past winter.
>
> \"This past season it was just me on payroll \-- deferred payroll,\"
> Fitzsimmons told Gothamist. \"It\'s unfortunately the side effect of
> running an arts institution.\"
>
> The Mermaid Parade crowd-sourced funds once before, for the 2013
> parade following Hurricane Sandy. According to Fitzsimmons, his
> organization never fully recovered financially. Denny\'s, an
> independent ice cream stand, used to rent space at Coney Island USA\'s
> 1208 Surf Avenue headquarters. It was destroyed in Sandy and has not
> been replaced.
>
> Asked if the parade will go on if funding falls short, Fitzsimmons
> said he couldn\'t say for sure. \"That\'s always a possibility,\" he
> said. \"There is enough push regarding the parade that will make this
> work, but it could leave us with larger financial problems.\"
