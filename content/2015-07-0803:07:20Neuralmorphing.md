[DeepStereo: Learning to Predict New Views from the World\'s
Imagery](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/539051/googles-deep-learning-machine-learns-to-synthesize-real-world-images/)

> Flynn and co\'s new approach is to train a machine vision algorithm to
> work out what the new image should look like having been trained on a
> vast dataset of sequential images.
>
> They trained their algorithm using \"images of street scenes captured
> by a moving vehicle.\" Indeed, they use 100,000 of these sequences as
> a training data set.
>
> They then tested it by removing one frame from a sequence of Street
> View images and asking it to reproduce it by looking only at the other
> images in the sequence. Finally, they compare the synthesized image
> with the one that was removed, giving them a kind of gold standard to
> contrast it with.

> The results are impressive. \"Overall, our model produces plausible
> outputs that are difficult to immediately distinguish from the
> original imagery,\" say Flynn and co.
