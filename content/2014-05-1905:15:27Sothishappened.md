I mention this only because it gives me a chance to tell you about one
of the saddest features of my Twitter feed, which is that every couple
of weeks, someone out there in the dunderweb @-mentions me with this
super clever new variant they\'ve just now thought up all by themselves
on either \"now you have two problems\" or the [Law of Software
Envelopment](http://www.jwz.org/hacks/) (the latter usually sounds
something like *\"Hurf durf cloud durf Facebook hurf durf expands hurf
durf git\"*.)

Stop.

Stop. Please stop.

Staaaaahhhhhhhhhppp.

You are making a \"GOT MILK\"\* joke here, people. It\'s the Twenty
First God Damned Century. It is no longer the Nineteen Hundred and
Nineties. It\'s time for some new jokes!

(Though I did get a kick out of [this
one](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/12/now-you-have-two-problems/) for a
minute.)
