English • Question about YaCy indexing
======================================

I\'m a little confused about how indexing in YaCy works. According to
this page: <http://yacy.de/en/Join.html> , I can help YaCy by running a
public peer. But I don\'t understand how simply running a public peer
would help other peers in the network. I would have to crawl websites
through the administration interface and build indexes as well,
wouldn\'t I? Because otherwise I have nothing to share with my peers.\

This topic:
[viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5116](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5116){.postlink-local}
seems to suggest that YaCy automatically indexes the pages I visit on my
browser. Is this true? How does YaCy even know what pages I\'m visiting?
(my HTTP requests don\'t go through YaCy at all).
