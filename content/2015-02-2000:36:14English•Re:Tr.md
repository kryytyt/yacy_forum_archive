Hi Low012,\
\
I hope you can find answers for your questions because I think it can be
used with html (zanata uses it to translate their website. As they are
also an opensource project I suggest you contact them and ask for help
regarding your doubts, we are a community so we are supposed to help
each other). I suspect that other languages like java or php are used
from inside the html code in order to get the translated strings.\
\
Converting the old files to [.po]{style="font-weight: bold"} is probably
not necessary. Use something like [sed]{style="font-weight: bold"} in
unix/linux to get rid of everything to the right of the
[::]{style="font-weight: bold"} and sites like zanata will allow you to
upload the file in .txt format (but I\'m not 100% sure).\
\
\
In linux there is also the option
<http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/translate-toolkit/en/latest/commands/txt2po.html?id=toolkit/txt2po>
and I think there are file converters for windows too.\
\
Best regards,\
