> When it comes to energy-rich bodily fluids, blood is hard to beat.
> Plasma, the liquid component of blood, is constantly suffused with
> dissolved glucose, our cells\' primary source of energy. Most
> enzymatic biofuel cells that have been developed to date target this
> molecule. \[\...\] When this was implanted into a rat\'s abdomen, it
> generated around 40 microwatts of power, which the team actually used
> to operate both an LED and a digital thermometer. \[\...\]
>
> Human sweat is rich in a compound called lactate, which can also be
> used to generate electricity using EFCs, replacing their glucose fuel.
> Since sweat is so much easier to access, researchers have already been
> able to test perspiration-powered EFCs on humans with encouraging
> results. \[\...\] Emphatic proof came the year after, when another
> group from UC San Diego came up with a wearable, textile-based EFC
> that could be integrated into sweat bands. A volunteer wore one of
> these while riding an exercise bike and, as with the tattoo-based
> devices, the cyclist\'s sweat allowed the fuel cells to generate
> electricity. This time, however, the sweat produced enough power to
> run an electronic device \-- either an LED or a digital watch \-- for
> a few tens of seconds at a time. \[\...\]

> At first glance, tears might seem like an even more unreliable source
> of fuel than sweat. But whatever our emotional state, we\'re always a
> little dewy-eyed. The cornea is continually kept moist by a film of
> what are called \"basal\" tears (as opposed to the \"psychic\" tears
> that well up when we cry). These mostly serve to lubricate and nourish
> the eye, but they\'re also full of energy. Among other chemicals,
> basal tears contain glucose, lactate, and ascorbate (a compound
> similar to vitamin C), any of which are an excellent fuel source for
> EFCs. \[\...\] The Utah researchers have just developed the first-ever
> contact lens with an integrated EFC, allowing it to generate
> electricity from human tears alone.
