English â€¢ Re: Settings & previous crawl data lost after power outage
====================================================================

Date: 2014-05-15 15:24:54

In regards to \"missing crawls\", I have some new facts:\
\
1 - What led me to think they were missing was the message that shows up
whenever I hover the mouse over System Status, in the left vertical bar
\"[You did not yet start a web crawl! You do not see all monitoring
options here, because some belong to crawl results monitoring. Start a
web crawl to see that.]{style="font-style: italic"}\"\
\
2 - However, in /Crawler\_p.html, all the \"missing crawls\" are showing
and running.\
\
So, apparently, the sudden power off seems to have created an
inconsistency.\
\
I still keep my previous questions:\
\
1 - Is there a way to recover previous crawl data? (Now I would
rephrase, \"\... to create consistency among crawling data and the
System Status information\")\
\
2 - What files/directories should I backup so that I\'m able to restore
Yacy to its prior status?
