Unfortunatley you are not the first person who makes a (very valid)
complaint about the current state of the translation system.\
\
The system is quite old already and has not been touched in years
(Correct me if I\'m wrong, anybody.). I had a look at it several months
ago, but did not come up with any smart solution to improve it back
then. You mentioned the .po format which is used by GNU gettext
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext>). Without looking at the format
any closer I see several advantages over the current system:\
\

-   it is a commonly used format which is supported by servcies like the
    ones you mentioned
-   gettext is well tested and there even is a free (Apache license)
    Java library
-   there are tools available for handling .po files (see:
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext#See_also>)

\
What I did not look at so far is if it works well with HTML (especially
with fragments of documents and with non-standard elements which are
used in the YacY template system).\
\
Requirements for a new system which come to my mind right now:\
\

-   supports a commonly used file format
-   provides tools to create a list off all texts which need to be
    translated
-   provides tools to create some sort of diff or hints for translators
    to see which texts are new, have changed, or have been deleted in
    new versions of YaCy
-   nice to have: some sort of converter to turn old (current)
    translations into new format
