Hello phazon,\
\
thank you for your feedback. We are indeed working on publishing the
source for our mobile apps under a free license.\
We wanted to do this much earlier; as we are a small team however,
things took us longer than expected. (Licensing can be a complicated
matter.)\
I expect we will have a release ready within the next few weeks, but
please don\'t pin me down to that.\
As a free software supporter (and FSFE fellow) I really want this to
happen as soon as possible.\
