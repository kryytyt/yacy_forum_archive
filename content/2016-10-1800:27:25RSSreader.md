RSS reader

Lazyweb, what is your favorite RSS reader app for iOS?

I switch back and forth between Feedly, Newsify and Reeder and I kind of
dislike them all.

I want the ability to go to the next article using either my left or
right hand. I want to be able to do this using a tap gesture, not with a
fucking horizontal swipe that constantly gets confused with a vertical
scroll. And since \"next\" is the most important command to the point
that it is nearly the *only* command, I want the click target to not be
itty bitty.

Why is this hard?
