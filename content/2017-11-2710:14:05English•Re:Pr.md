Yes it would be strange to be only a coincidence\... But I have \"good\"
news : I could reproduce the exact same issue as you when running YaCy
1.92/9000 with a Oracle JVM jdk1.7.0\_80. I had no time yet to check
in-depth what is exactly going wrong, but at least I can ensure you that
everything works fine with the same YaCy release on a recent 1.8 JVM
(OpenJDK or Oracle 1.8.0\_151), so I suggest you to upgrade at least
your Java version.
