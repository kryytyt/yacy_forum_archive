English â€¢ meanings of \"DOCUMENTS\" and \"DHT WORDS\", \"URLs\" and \"RWIs\"
============================================================================

On the Status.html page, there are numbers: \"Documents\" and \"DHT
Words\". What exactly do they mean?\
\
How necessary are the things counted? How safe are they to delete? Is
one of them used only for ranking?\
\
At IndexControlURLs\_p.html, if I click \"Generate Statistics\", I can
delete things for a domain, what do I lose then? I\'ve deleted all
domains, and now sending at
<http://yacy.local:8090/IndexControlRWIs_p.html> sends \"0\" words,
while all URLs are \"not found\". How do I delete all the URLs without
words then, or all words without URLs?\
\
At IndexControlRWIs\_p.html, I can delete a word. There are two
checkboxes, one of which says it\'s safe to delete the URLs, although it
will produce something unresolved. The other one says it\'s very
extensive. What does that mean?
