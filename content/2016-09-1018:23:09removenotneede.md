``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
remove not needed counter in Tokeninzer (completing last changes)
including a small change, word posintext counting. 
We remember/store 1st posintext. Previously following words got a handle (posintext)
excluding found. Now it just counts and assigns true posintext as handle (posintext)
```
