> Flames dance out of cracks in its floor and around the sides, and a

> \"Soviet geologists started drilling a borehole to prospect for gas at

> boring equipment suddenly drilled through into an underground cavern,
> and a deep sinkhole formed. The equipment tumbled through but
> fortunately no one was killed.\" \"Fearing that the crater would emit
> poisonous gases, the scientists took the decision to set it alight,
> thinking that the gas would burn out quickly and this would cause the
> flames to go out,\" Bushmakin said.
>
> But they never did, and now serve as a potent symbol of
> Turkmenistan\'s vast gas reserves, believed to be the fourth largest
> in the world.

> \"Our main task is to create an attractive image of Turkmenistan as a
> tourism destination,\" he said.
