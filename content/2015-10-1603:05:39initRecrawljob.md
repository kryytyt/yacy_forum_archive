``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
init Recrawl job chunk size to max crawl loader during job start, to use some system preferences
and allow injection of recrawl urls before queue is empty
During recrawl the balancer hangs on the very last urls often on hosts with huge delay time,
by allowing injection earlier progress is more balanced. Max number of injected crawl urls by recrawl job is 2 * max loader.
