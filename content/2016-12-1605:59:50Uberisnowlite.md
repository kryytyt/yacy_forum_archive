So let\'s see\...

The self-driving software is bad enough that they run red lights and
make dangerous turns\... but they have humans in the drivers\' seat! Who
are also so terrible at their jobs that they can\'t prevent the car from
running red lights and must be fired.

I guess none of us are as incompetent as all of us? The software is so
bad that it makes human drivers *even worse?*

The usual argument for self-driving cars is that they will be safer for
everyone than human-piloted cars. If that hypothesis turns out to be
true, then I\'m all for them! One can even imagine a shiny Starfleet
future where self-driving cars lead to the end of personal car ownership
and dramatic emissions reduction. Enter the shimmering arc!

Uber, of course, does not give the slightest fractional shits about
whether self-driving cars are *safer* or *cleaner*: they are interested
in them because they are *cheaper.* Allow me to remind you of this bit
from [*Fight Club:*](http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Fight-Club.html)

And now we get to the part where the Uber software, operating as
designed, is now literally trying to murder me:

The people who wrote this software *do not understand the traffic laws*
and programmed it with a set of rules that they figured was *close
enough*. And then released them into the public.

\"Disrupt transportation! Move fast, release early, and crush innocent
people under two tons of fast-moving steel!\"

I really can\'t express how unsettling it was today, riding my bicycle
in traffic in the rain \-- a time when San Francisco drivers are
notoriously even *less competent* and *more erratic* than under normal
conditions \-- and wondering what fresh new hell of unpredictability I
might encounter from poorly-behaving *software* in an alpha-test that I
most assuredly *did not* click \"Agree\" on.

Fuck Uber.
