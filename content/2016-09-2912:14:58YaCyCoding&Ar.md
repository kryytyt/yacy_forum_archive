YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: Move interface to HTML5
========================================================

Date: 2016-09-29 12:14:58

Ok so after checking carefully, it is obvious that YaCy web interface
pages are declared as Strict XHTML 1.0 according to their DTD, but
indeed have been long time using many HTML 5 features and syntax.\
\
You can easily check this with the [W3C Markup Validation
Service](https://validator.w3.org/){.postlink} on your YaCy peer main
search page, and compare how many validation errors are reported in
XHTML 1.0 Strict validation mode (automatically detected) and forced
HTML5 :\
- XHTML 1.0 : 56 Errors, 56 warning(s)\
- HTML 5 : 1 Warning and 1 Error\
\
So let\'s fix this!
