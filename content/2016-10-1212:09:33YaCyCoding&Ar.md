Hi ds810,\
if it is not a problem for you to continue this discussion in English (I
am sorry to still have a so bad German level) I am ok to check what can
be done.\
\
I already imported your blacklist (UbuntuServer) on a YaCy peer running
in peer-to-peer mode, but I could not reproduce the 100% CPU burn you
report\... Can you give some examples of search terms that trigger this
behavior? Do you also have this problem when using your blacklist on a
freshly installed YaCy (with an empty local index)?\
\
Best regards
