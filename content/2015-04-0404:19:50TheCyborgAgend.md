Now first, let\'s just take a moment to savor the fact that *\"The
Transhumanist Party\"* is a thing that exists. And that *\"The US
Presidential candidate of the Transhumanist Party\"* is also a thing
that exists.

But that being said, I admit that I have often thought that if even half
of the money we\'ve been pouring into contractors to build lowered
service counters, triple-sized bathroom stalls, single-story elevators
and miles of ramps were spend on robotics instead, then by now everyone
in the country who needed one could have their own Power Loader.
Upstream solutions are better than downstream. Just because he\'s a kook
doesn\'t make him wrong.
