The *idea* behind the Electoral College is that the people can\'t be
directly trusted, and instead appoint a set of grown-ups to make the
actual decisions for them. It\'s the same reason we have a Congress and
Senate instead of just letting everyone vote on laws directly.

However, in *practice* what the Electoral College does is disenfranchise
huge parts of the country, because its dynamics ensure that Presidential
campaigns only really happen in about six contentious states, which are
neither the most populous nor the most typical. The candidates focus
their campaigns on those states, and the topics that resonate most with
those states, and ignore the rest of the country. That\'s why Ohio and
Florida get to decide who our President is, and California largely
doesn\'t matter, despite having more than twice their combined
population.

So this is why I hold two opinions that the simpleminded might see as
contradictory:

1.  Given that the Electoral College exists, it would be right and
    proper, not to mention legal, to use that system to keep a fascist,
    racist rapist out of office.
2.  The Electoral College is a bad system and should be replaced with a
    national popular vote.

There\'s an interesting approach underway in an attempt to make this
happen without having to go the full route of a Constitutional
amendment: states are individually passing laws saying \"our electors
pledge to follow the popular vote, but only as soon as enough other
states have also signed on.\" (Game theory!)
