> It is now legal for law enforcement in North Dakota to fly drones
> armed with everything from Tasers to tear gas thanks to a last-minute
> push by a pro-police lobbyist.
>
> The bill\'s stated intent was to require police to obtain a search
> warrant from a judge in order to use a drone to search for criminal
> evidence. In fact, the original draft of Representative Rick Becker\'s
> bill would have banned all weapons on police drones.
>
> Then Bruce Burkett of the North Dakota Peace Officer\'s Association
> was allowed by the state house committee to amend HB 1328 and limit
> the prohibition only to lethal weapons. \"Less than lethal\" weapons
> like rubber bullets, pepper spray, tear gas, sound cannons, and Tasers
> are therefore permitted on police drones.
>
> Becker, the bill\'s Republican sponsor, said he had to live with it.

> \"This is one I\'m not in full agreement with. I wish it was any
> weapon,\" he said at a hearing in March. \"In my opinion there should
> be a nice, red line: Drones should not be weaponized. Period.\"
>
> Even \"less than lethal\" weapons can kill though. At least 39 people
> have been killed by police Tasers in 2015 so far, according to The
> Guardian. Bean bags, rubber bullets, and flying tear gas canisters
> have also maimed, if not killed, in the U.S. and abroad. \[\...\]
>
> Money\'s no problem for the the Grand Forks County Sheriff\'s
> Department, though: A California manufacturer loaned them two drones.
> Grand Forks County Sheriff Bob Rost said his department\'s drones are
> only equipped with cameras and he doesn\'t think he should need a
> warrant to go snooping. \[\...\]
>
> Rost said he needs to use drones for surveillance in order to obtain a
> warrant in the first place. \"If you have nothing to hide, you have
> nothing to fear,\" Becker remembered opponents like Rost saying.
