Says](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/12/523603112/alabama-senate-says-church-can-start-its-own-police-force)

> A large church in Alabama is one step closer to creating its own
> police force, a move that seems to be without precedent in the U.S.
> The state\'s Senate has approved legislation that would give church
> police officers the same powers other law enforcement officers have in
> Alabama. \[\...\]
>
> Both chambers\' legislation specifically names Briarwood Presbyterian
> Church, a Birmingham megachurch that \"says it needs its own police
> officers to keep its school as well as its more than 4,000 person
> congregation safe,\" Alabama Public Radio reports. \[\...\]
>
> Earlier this month, Alabama\'s House adopted the Alabama Church
> Protection Act, which would help religious groups form armed security
> patrols. It authorizes \"any church or place of worship to establish a
> security program by which designated members are authorized to carry
> firearms for the protection of the congregation of the church or place
> of worship.\" The act also provides \"limited immunity for members of
> such a program when they\'re acting within their duties.
