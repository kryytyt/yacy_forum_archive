OK so i run an image search for bearhug, lets say there are 26
results\... only 4 images show up, why is this.\
\
A note, my search engine is adult/fetish/fantasy themed so if you want
to test it make sure you are OK with adult content.\
\
76.29.59.176:8090\
\
run search for bearhug under images.\
\
text search does not display this flakyness\... but some of the text
snippets are missing\
\
is there something wrong with my computer or do I have to let the search
completely finish indexing.\
\
also How do I make sure it completely indexes my ENTIRE tumblr blog,
without screwing with crawl depth excessively.
