Some friends and I are re-watching *The Venture Bros* from the
beginning, and this is how we fortify ourselves:

So far, we\'re able to sprint through about 18 episodes before we are
too (doc) hammered to continue.

I find that the show makes a *lot* more sense when binge-watching it.
The multi-year gaps between seasons were long enough that I had
basically forgotten everything that happened. It\'s a more coherent
overall story than you might remember. And when watching the DVD
versions rather than the TV versions, there is really a *lot* more
lovingly-rendered ball sack than I expected.

Also, let me say that this season of *Archer* is gold. I wasn\'t crazy
about *Archer Vice*, but this season is their best so far.
