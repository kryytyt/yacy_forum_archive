YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: Move interface to HTML5
========================================================

Date: 2016-09-19 18:40:32

Hello everyone, thanks to Orbiter, in the meantime these requests have
been merged, so the webclient is now in HTML5.\
\
Any feedback or opinion about progressively switching now the classical
YaCy web interface to HTML5?\
\
I would add it could greatly be beneficial to improve accessibility more
easily using modern
[ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/){.postlink} properties.
