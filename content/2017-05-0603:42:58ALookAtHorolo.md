A Look At Horology\'s Easter Problem
====================================

*(For various regrettable reasons, \"Calendrical Calculations\" became
one of my Dream Jeopardy Categories years ago, so this article really
winds me up.)*

Incidentally, when they say \"which you might remember from our coverage
of the Vacheron ultra-complication 57260\", WOW, they were [not even
joking! This is
amazeballs!](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/the-vacheron-constantin-reference-57260)

> cathedral at Strasbourg, in Alsace, France.
