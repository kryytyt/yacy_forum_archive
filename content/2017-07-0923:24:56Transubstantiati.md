> At the request of Pope Francis, the Congregation for Divine Worship
> and the Discipline of the Sacraments is writing to Diocesan Bishops to
> remind them that it falls to them above all to duly provide for all
> that is required for the celebration of the Lord\'s Supper. \[\...\]
>
> \"The bread used in the celebration of the Most Holy Eucharistic
> Sacrifice must be unleavened, purely of wheat, and recently made so
> that there is no danger of decomposition. It follows therefore that
> bread made from another substance, even if it is grain, or if it is
> mixed with another substance different from wheat to such an extent
> that it would not commonly be considered wheat bread, does not
> constitute valid matter for confecting the Sacrifice and the
> Eucharistic Sacrament. It is a grave abuse to introduce other
> substances, such as fruit or sugar or honey, into the bread for
> confecting the Eucharist. \[\...\]
>
> \"Hosts that are completely gluten-free are invalid matter for the
> celebration of the Eucharist. Low-gluten hosts (partially gluten-free)
> are valid matter, provided they contain a sufficient amount of gluten
> to obtain the confection of bread without the addition of foreign
> materials and without the use of procedures that would alter the
> nature of bread\" (A. 1-2). \[\...\]
>
> The same Congregation also decided that Eucharistic matter made with
> genetically modified organisms can be considered valid matter (cf.
> Letter to the Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the
> Discipline of the Sacraments, 9 December 2013, Prot. N. 89/78 \--
> 44897).
