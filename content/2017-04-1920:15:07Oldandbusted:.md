Old and busted: CIA outsourced Folter nach Ägypten.

New hotness: [Scotland Yard outsourced Journalisten- und
Demonstranten-Beschnüffeln nach
Indien](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/04/15/hack-a15.html).

> The letter reveals that through the hacking, Scotland Yard has
> illegally accessed the email accounts of activists for many years, and
> this was possible due to help from "counterparts in India." The letter
> alleged that the Metropolitan Police had asked police in India to
> obtain passwords on their behalf---**a job that the Indian police
> subcontracted out to groups of hackers in India**.
