English â€¢ Load Balance of API Crawls Timer problem.
===================================================

Date: 2014-10-31 07:31:34

My idea is to download the API table, perform a load balance, Delete All
and reenter the new info in a short space of time.\
\
I have being trying to calculate how to shift the Date next EXEC time in
the API calls so that I can offset and load balance my peer if I have a
lot of eg RSS Feeds or Web crawls from the same site.\
\
Just a rough example assuming I have the rig to handle it.\
Crawl 1000 RSS Feeds/Hour once per hour 24 hours a day.\
I ideally need to schedule each new crawl 3.6 seconds apart as not to
overload any of the systems.\
\
I have tried to calculate the API timers resolution/counts in order to
recalculate Date next Exec but I get 2 different results.\
Does anybody have a figure on the time base of what it should be?\
