=============================

Date: 2016-10-24 13:13:06

I\'ve tried to use yacy, but first it\'s too difficult for simple users
!\
\
And there\'s a lot of problems, i\'ve tried first on a computer with 3gb
of memory, celeron 900ghz windows 7 and always memory problem, after
sometimes less than one hour it stop saying no enough memory but the
problem was the same when i allocate 1500 gb of memory ! And last
problem, it doesn\'t want to start, it start, java is started but i
never can load it in navigator !\
\
I\'ve tried with another computer aspire v3 731g windows 8, with 6gb if
memory and problem is the same, it seem it work good only when i
allocate 3gb of memory. But if often cause problem when i use computer
with yacy working, computer disk is too often used by yacy and its slow
all system, i\'ve tried to reduce priority of java to minimum but it the
same problem ! And the same problem than before, i\'ve tried to activate
a dictionnary and now it never lauch, i see yacy in status bar bur the
navigator interface never load\...\
\
And i\' dont find an option to limit the use of internet connexion (like
20mb max), my connexion is 30mb.\
\
There\'s a lot of problems, i\'ve tried to install it on a unbuntu and
with last java 8 it said me an error in crawler, a java exception so it
can\'t open url ?\
\
\
another p2p search is more simple to use and with many more active users
