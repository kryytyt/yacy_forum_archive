[Man Saves Wife\'s Sight by 3D Printing Her
Tumor](http://makezine.com/magazine/hands-on-health-care/)

> At this point, Balzer requested Scott\'s DICOM files so he could work
> with them at home. It was a crucial step. A few months later, Scott
> had another MRI, and the radiologist came back with a horrifying
> report: The tumor had grown substantially, which indicated a far more
> grave condition than was initially diagnosed. But back at home, Balzer
> used Photoshop to layer the new DICOM files on top of the old images,
> and realized that the tumor hadn\'t grown at all \-- the radiologist
> had just measured from a different point on the image. Once his relief
> subsided, Balzer was furious and more determined than ever to stay in
> control of Scott\'s treatment. \"I thought, \'why don\'t we take it to
> the next level?\'\" Balzer says. \"Let\'s see what kind of tools are
> available so that I can take the DICOMs, which are 2D slices, and
> convert them into a 3D model.\"
