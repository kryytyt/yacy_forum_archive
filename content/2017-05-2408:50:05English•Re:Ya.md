Yes that\'s it : currently openjdk-7-jdk is the required dependency
needed to build the Debian package. But this doesn\'t prevent you to
then install and run with openjdk-8!\
If this is a problem, you can modify this dependency for your own use in
the file

Code: 
:   `yacy_search_server/debian/control`

.\
\
And for the build, as stated in the message, you also need the
\"debhelper\" and \"m4\" packages.
