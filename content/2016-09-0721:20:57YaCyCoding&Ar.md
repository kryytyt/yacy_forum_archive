Hi,\
I don\'t use any Macs, but I followed the changes on that topic with
interest.\
So I agree to publish that soon.\
\
Maybe we should disable the use the swfParser - I got some cases where
it caused ContentScraper.anchors to be filled in GB-range, which may
fail in many installations. I think a feature like parsing flash isn\'t
worth scaring new user away.\
(I didn\'t had time to fix / workaround that)\
