Hilfe für Einsteiger und Anwender • How to disable accept remote crawling
=========================================================================

I just installed Yacy in a senior mode and I found out that it indexes
pages (from domains .fr, .cn ), but I yet didn\'t put on indexing. I
wouldn\'t like to index and store in base all sites in a row. I would
like to choose sites and to put them on indexing independently.\
\
How i can disable accept remote crawling?
