Added a new Debug/Analysis advanced settings subsection.

As discussed in PR #93 with @JeremyRand and @reger24 this new advanced
settings page includes:
 - a new setting to control remote Solr responses encoding
 - some existing debug settings which could not be set through the admin
user interface
```
