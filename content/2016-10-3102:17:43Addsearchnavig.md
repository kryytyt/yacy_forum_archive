Add search navigator interface to allow for additional navigators (plugins)
Prepared the first basic navigators (for authors and collections) for the
list of SearchEvent.navigatorPlugins and adjusted servlet to use these.
- this allows to configure display order of these navigators (by ordering config string)
- eventually allows for additional and/or custom navigators using any
available index field without need for changing servlets
- the Collection navigation has been adjusted to exclude the internal, 
default robot_*  and dht collections from displaying
- rwi results are now also checked for navigatior by the refactored navi's

So far no config options were added to customize or add navigators (may
come later if route of upcoming modularization/plugin system is defined).
