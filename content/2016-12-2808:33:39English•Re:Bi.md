Hi bubul :\
- your admin protected pages require admin authentication to be used,
and you configured your search main page to not display the
administration button but to be publicly accessible : isn\'t it what you
wanted?\
- when you switch between modes, you also switch your internal index so
it is normal behavior you do not see anymore the crawled pages in other
modes : each mode has its own index data.\
- in 1.90 release, switching between modes doesn\'t work properly (see
[mantis 686](http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=686){.postlink} ), but
this issue has been fixed in the latest 1.92 release. So you should
upgrade, or restart your peer after every mode switch.\
- regarding crawl efficiency, it is quite difficult to analyze, but
network can also be a limiting factor, among many others\...\

Best regards
