English â€¢ Re: Yacy server performance monitoring
================================================

Date: 2014-05-14 14:09:30

An update after a week of (almost) 24x7 Yacy server running.\
\
(\"Almost\" because I had a power outage - see the memory graphs, in
blue, where the outage shows as a gap - that last a couple of minutes,
and one unnecessary Yacy reset)\
\
According to the Cacti graphs below (and the fact that the server
didn\'t present any strange behaviour), Yacy shows up as a very stable
and sustainable application (although a little bit resource consuming,
but this is due to Java, I guess).\

Notes:\
\
1) The last two and a half graphs shows bandwidth usage. The first
referring to the last day and the next to the last week. Due to those
two connection bursts, the weekly graph scale got too high to show a
comprehensible view, so I present a 24 hour graph to give an idea of
Yacy\'s bandwidth usage: the rightmost part of the graph, with higher
bandwidth usage, referrs to a running crawl.\
\
2) In regards to the CPU usage graph, the growth of the blue area (user
processes) referrs to a new Cacti template I added - Percona MySQL
monitoring - that is CPU-consumming; the growth in the green area (nice)
referrs to running crawls
