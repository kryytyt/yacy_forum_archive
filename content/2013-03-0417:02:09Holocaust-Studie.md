[Holocaust-Studie zählt mal die KZs, Ghettos und Zwangsarbeits-Orte
zusammen](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/sunday-review/the-holocaust-just-got-more-shocking.html)
und kommt auf eine Summe von 42500. Hier ist, was die alles mitgezählt
haben:

> The documented camps include not only "killing centers" but also
> thousands of forced labor camps, where prisoners manufactured war
> supplies; prisoner-of-war camps; sites euphemistically named "care"
> centers, where pregnant women were forced to have abortions or their
> babies were killed after birth; and brothels, where women were coerced
> into having sex with German military personnel.

Krass.
