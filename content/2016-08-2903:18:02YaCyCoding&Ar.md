With commit [https://github.com/yacy/yacy\_search\_ser \...
c5512bdd1e](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commit/9462a32244a3faeb06ccf165afe230c5512bdd1e){.postlink}\
v 1.91/9114 I implemented a additional news service to share added or
modified UI translation (with intention for easy community support)\
\
Functionality:\
- YaCy UI translation modification (via
<http://localhost:8090/Translator_p.html> ) are stored in a local
translation file (DATA/locale/??.lng)\
- with the new <http://localhost:8090/TransNews_p.html> servlet the
entries in this file can be shared via the internal news service\
- this servlet offers to vote (positive/negative) on the translation
proposals in the new spool\
- on positive votes, the news entry is added to the own local
translation list and a voting message is added to the news pool\
\
At this time, no rule has been implemented to handle remote voting
news.\
One not really correct handling is, after voting (and by that adding to
the local file) one may publish the remote translation as own proposal
(the local translation uses just the \*.lng format with no info about
the origin). But a check is included to not duplicate translation
proposal for same key/source text.\
\
Further ideas are (not implemented yet):\
- route news to a language maintainer, so it can finally be included in
the distribution (but we probably need to update and verify the list of
available maintainers)\
- do something with the voting\
- use xliff file format for local modified translation file and include
status information (see point above)\
\
But to get going and see what can be improved,\
have fun to push some news out.\
