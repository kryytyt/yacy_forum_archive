Made possible to use https for remote search on peers with SSL enabled.


Default is still http to prevent any regressions, but a new setting is
available to choose https as the preferred protocol to perform remote
searches. 
New configuration setting 'remotesearch.https.preferred' is manually
editable in yacy.conf file or in Advanced Properties page
(/ConfigProperties_p.html).
Should be enabled as default in the future for improved privacy. 
Https could also eventually be used for other peers communications.
