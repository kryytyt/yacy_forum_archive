[![](http://www.jwz.org/images/anigif_optimized-7818-1432201062-11.gif)](http://www.jwz.org/hacks/jwz-php-lint.pl)I
have spent the last few days down in the PHP Mines. Those fumes are
*really* toxic. I\'m pretty sure I\'ve contracted pleurisy from inhaling
Cheetos dust.

So [DNA Lounge has an online store](http://www.dnalounge.com/store/),
which is an enormous, and ancient, and shitty, pile of PHP code. I have
[often](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/04/dna-store-logins/) characterized
it as \"it\'s a pile of shit, but it\'s *our* pile of shit.\"

Well, now that I\'m opening a [new
nightclub](http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2015/05/05.html), I
need to make that code be able to function when installed on a domain
whose name is [not](http://www.codeword-sf.com/) \"dnalounge.com\". As
you can expect, this has been a process of discovering all kinds of
hardcoded assumptions lurking in the bowels. It\'s like moving to a new
house after you\'ve been dug in for a decade: look at all this crap
stuffed in the back of the closet that you didn\'t remember was there!

So there has been a lot of global search and replace, and a lot of
variables being added and moved around, and that means destabilization,
and that\'s bad, mmkay?

So I wrote a Perl program to do static analysis of PHP. And it parses
PHP using regular expressions because fuck you that\'s why.

For your entertainment \-- because I sincerely doubt that anyone who is
not me will ever use this without lulz in their heart \-- I give you
