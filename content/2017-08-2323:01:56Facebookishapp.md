Facebook is happy to do business with nazis and racists on your behalf, because they are wonderful people.

I did not enjoy waking up to: \"Why are you advertising on Breitbart?\"

Apparently if you buy ads *on Facebook, for Facebook*, they will also
push your ads out to nazi sites.

Both Facebook and Google weasel out of their culpability here by making
you upload a by-inclusion blacklist: [Facebook
instructions](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1314478651899918?helpref=faq_content).
[Google
instructions](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2454012?hl=en).

Given that, I am surprised that it is difficult to find a comprehensive
list of, \"these sites are *fucking nazis* and you should blacklist them
from your ads.\" [Here\'s
one](http://www.newwhyweb.com/white-supremacist-altright-adwords-exclusion/).
It seems like this list should be a lot longer. Let me know if you have
a better resource.

When one searches for said blacklist, what one finds instead are are ten
thousand breathless articles where some brand\'s PR flunky is quoted
saying \"we swear we are trying not to advertise with nazis, but the ads
keep showing up there anyway and we can\'t make it stop.\" So that\'s
awesome.
