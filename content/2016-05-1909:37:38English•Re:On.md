English â€¢ Re: Only get 20 results from API
==========================================

There was a fix for chunks size in January :
[https://github.com/yacy/yacy\_search\_ser \...
a7dc1973f5](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commit/4765e374e65d1a8dd264ff0bb6e3eaa7dc1973f5){.postlink}.\
So if you run a yacy version upper than v1.83/9654 you should be able to
have up to 100 results per request. I am running a yacy 1.83/9816 and it
works.\
You can even theorically have up to 1000 results per request if you set
the \"Snippet Fetch Strategy\" (in
<http://localhost:8090/ConfigPortal.html>) to \"CACHEONLY\" or
\"FALSE\".\
\
But you are right that getting last results is still not currently
working. With my node it always ends at (page size x 10) or at a few
hundreds when maximumRecords is set to 1000 with CECHEONLY strategy.\
\
So effectively this can give some fun work for a goodwill one who would
like to fix it one and for all!
