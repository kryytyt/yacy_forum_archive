Hello Mars, I hope it is not a problem if I reply to you in English\...\
\
I just had a review to your script and didn\'t test it, but I like the
idea. I planned to code a similar task using the less often updated but
quite large [DMOZ dumps](http://rdf.dmoz.org/){.postlink}\...\
\
I believe it would be even greater if this kind of import could be made
directly with existing YaCy features. I was thinking of a scenario like
this :\
- in CrawlStartExpert.html one could enter the top-1m.csv.zip (the free
alexa dump you use) URL as starting point\
- zip and csv parsers would extract links from the dump and propose this
as the link-list\
- crawl could be started with the usual config options\
- YaCy Process Scheduler (Table\_API\_p.html) then allow to replay the
crawl at the desired rate\
\
Theorically there would be not so much to do to make this possible :
modifying YaCy csv parser to let it extract http links, and ensure good
memory performance to handle the large links list\...\
\
What do you think about it?
