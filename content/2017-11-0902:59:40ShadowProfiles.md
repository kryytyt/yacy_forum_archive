> Shadow contact information has been a known feature of Facebook for a
> few years now. But most users remain unaware of its reach and power.
> Because shadow-profile connections happen inside Facebook\'s
> algorithmic black box, people can\'t see how deep the data-mining of
> their lives truly is, until an uncanny recommendation pops up.
> \[\...\]
>
> Facebook warns users to be judicious about using all this data. \"You
> may have business or personal contacts in your phone,\" the Learn More
> screen admonishes the reader. \"Please only send friend requests to
> people you know personally who would welcome the invite.\"
>
> Having issued this warning, and having acknowledged that people in
> your address book may not necessarily want to be connected to you,
> Facebook will then do exactly what it warned you not to do. If you
> agree to share your contacts, every piece of contact data you possess
> will go to Facebook, and the network will then use it to try to search
> for connections between everyone you know, no matter how slightly \--
> and you won\'t see it happen. \[\...\]
>
> The existence of shadow contact information came to light in 2013
> after Facebook admitted it had discovered and fixed \"a bug.\" The bug
> was that when a user downloaded their Facebook file, it included not
> just their friends\' visible contact information, but also their
> friends\' shadow contact information.
>
> The problem with the bug, for Facebook, was not that all the
> information was lumped together \-- it was that it had mistakenly
> shown users the lump existed. The extent of the connections Facebook
> builds around its users is supposed to be visible only to the company
> itself.

If this sounds a lot like Equifax to you, then you are, like, some kind
of pattern-matching *machine:*

[Schneier\'s Congressional testimony on
Equifax:](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/11/me_on_the_equif.html)

> 3\. There are thousands of data brokers with similarly intimate
> information, similarly at risk.
>
> Equifax is more than a credit reporting agency. It\'s a data broker.
> It collects information about all of us, analyzes it all, and then
> sells those insights. It might be one of the biggest, but there are
> 2,500 to 4,000 other data brokers that are collecting, storing, and
> selling information about us \-- almost all of them companies you\'ve
> never heard of and have no business relationship with.
>
> The breadth and depth of information that data brokers have is
> astonishing. Data brokers collect and store billions of data elements
> covering nearly every US consumer. Just one of the data brokers
> studied holds information on more than 1.4 billion consumer
> transactions and 700 billion data elements, and another adds more than
> 3 billion new data points to its database each month. \[\...\]
>
> 4\. These data brokers deliberately hide their actions, and make it
> difficult for consumers to learn about or control their data.
>
> If there were a dozen people who stood behind us and took notes of
> everything we purchased, read, searched for, or said, we would be
> alarmed at the privacy invasion. But because these companies operate
> in secret, inside our browsers and financial transactions, we don\'t
> see them and we don\'t know they\'re there.
>
> Regarding Equifax, few consumers have any idea what the company knows
> about them, who they sell personal data to or why. If anyone knows
> about them at all, it\'s about their business as a credit bureau, not
> their business as a data broker. Their website lists 57 different
> offerings for business: products for industries like automotive,
> education, health care, insurance, and restaurants. \[\...\]
>
> 6\. The market cannot fix this because we are not the customers of data
> brokers.
>
> The customers of these companies are people and organizations who want
> to buy information: banks looking to lend you money, landlords
> deciding whether to rent you an apartment, employers deciding whether
> to hire you, companies trying to figure out whether you\'d be a
> profitable customer \-- everyone who wants to sell you something, even
> governments.
>
> Markets work because buyers choose from a choice of sellers, and
> sellers compete for buyers. None of us are Equifax\'s customers. None
> of us are the customers of any of these data brokers. We can\'t refuse
> to do business with the companies. We can\'t remove our data from
> their databases. With few limited exceptions, we can\'t even see what
> data these companies have about us or correct any mistakes.
>
> We are the product that these companies sell to their customers: those
> who want to use our personal information to understand us, categorize
> us, make decisions about us, and persuade us.
