Thank you for the tip. I have used that command and get the following
error.\
\
Error occurred during initialization of VM\
Server VM is only supported on ARMv7+ VFP\
\
So there seems to be a problem with java.\
Does anyone know what might be going on here?\
\
Why wouldn\'t yacy give an error when launched?
