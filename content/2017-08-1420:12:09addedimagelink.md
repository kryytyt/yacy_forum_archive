added image link in search results
This should be a help to make a preview of search results.
The image is computed from the list of embedded images, it is
always the first image in that list.
In rss-type results the image is presented like
<media:content medium="image" url="https://abc.xyz/logo.png"/>
as defined in
http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss#media-content
```
