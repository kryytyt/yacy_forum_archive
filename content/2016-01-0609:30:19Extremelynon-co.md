I don\'t understand how \"a company that rents unsold outdoor ad space\"
differs from \"a billboard company\", given that until they are sold,
all billboards are un-sold. They couldn\'t just say, \"we rent
billboards\"?

I really like the idea of this, but I think a lot of their design
choices are crap. When your layout has the name of the artist taking up
the same amount of space or more than the art itself, your priorities
are showing.
