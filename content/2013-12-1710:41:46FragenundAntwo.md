\@dir, your thoughts about structuring the forums into language-specific
departments is basically right, but the hint \'and english forums\' in
the title is just a patch to the problem that the english forums in
yacy-forum.org is so badly maintained and full of spam and it is not a
good place to link to at this time.\
\
The very simple answer to the demand to make international sections in
the forums here is that it would also not be possible for us to maintain
non-english/german sections because we cannot speak these languages. The
only exception is english, therefore we encourage the people to also
speak english here. Nevertheless I believe that a spanish/french/russian
etc. YaCy forum should be maintained by someone who speaks this language
and therefore should run their own forums.\
\
This is therefore a call to everyone who wants a non-german YaCy forum:
please start one yourself! I will be happy to link your forum on
yacy.net
