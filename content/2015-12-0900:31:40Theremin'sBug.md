> The Soviets would sit outside the embassy, either in another building
> or in a van. From this remote location they would aim a radio
> transmitter at the great seal. The bug inside would receive this
> signal and transmit voices in the room on a second, higher frequency.
> It did all of this with no standard internal components. No resistors,
> no tubes, no traditional capacitors, or the like. There were
> capacitive properties to the mechanism. For instance, a capacitor is
> formed between the diaphragm and the tuning peg of the device.
>
> Receive tuning (if it can be called such) was achieved by the
> precisely cut antenna. The RF carrier transmitted by the Russians
> would be received at the antenna and travel into the body of the
> device which was a resonant cavity. That resonant chamber was
> capacatively coupled to the thin conductive diaphragm which formed the
> microphone.
>
> Sound waves would cause the diaphragm to move, which would vary the
> capacitance between the body and diaphragm, forming a condenser
> microphone. It is important to note that the bug didn\'t transmit and
> receive on the same frequency. According to Peter Wright, the
> excitation frequency used by the Russians was actually 800 MHz. The
> cavity would resonate at a multiple of this base frequency, producing
> the 1.6 GHz output seen by Bezjian.
