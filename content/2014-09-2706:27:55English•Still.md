English â€¢ Still some crashing problems
======================================

Date: 2014-09-27 06:27:55

Hello I decided to try things again. I simply left everything at the
default this time and initiated a local crawl of my local
craigslist.org. Within about 15 minutes the node crashed (web UI not
responsive) and I had to reset in using systemd restart. Please let me
know what data I can provide to help fix this.
