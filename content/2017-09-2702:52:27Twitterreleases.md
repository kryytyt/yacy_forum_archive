> Trump from its service for one reason: He\'s good for business.

> Alright, Twitter didn\'t literally say that, but it was heavily

> \"newsworthy,\" with Twitter claiming that letting him stay on the
> platform helps keep people \"informed about what\'s happening in the
> world.\" This justification helps absolve Twitter of any
> responsibility for what Trump does, and it saves the company from
> having to take any specific stand against anything he might do or say.
> Also, the thread says that Twitter holds all accounts \"to the same
> rules,\" which is funny because it\'s definitely not true.
