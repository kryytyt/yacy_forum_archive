Hi LA\_FORGE, sorry for the delayed answer, but as far as I know :\
- post-processing runs only once all crawls are terminated (see [the
conditional
check](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/8303e15419e789cad94b94a1d65e00f9627cd5f1/source/net/yacy/search/Switchboard.java#L2769){.postlink})\
- once post-processed and committed, related Solr fields are indeed
exported with the XML export feature, so they do not need to be computed
again.\
\
A few complementary remarks on export/import however :\
- the webgraph collection is not exported, so obviously you also loose
any post-processing computation on webgraph collcetion fields when
exporting\
- some post-processed fields computation is related to the local peer
data : for example references post-processing uses the citation index,
and eventually the webgraph collection if enabled. So to my mind, to be
truly accurate, theses values should be computed again when importing to
another peer with a larger or a different index. But it wont\' be done
automatically after import, as the fields marking that post-processing
is needed (process\_sxt and harvestkey\_s) are cleaned-up after a
successful post-processing\...
