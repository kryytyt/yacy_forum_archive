@ q5sys:\
\
Maybe we can not rescue from ARM boards in future.

Today I could read in the c\'t magazine that also AMD starts to produce
processors with ARM technology. Let me estimate: In 5 years the normal
consumer will buy an ARM based system in 95% of all cases. We use this
technology with the most tablet computers today. And also our NAS
devices or new TV-sets, our radio, \..., uses this technology. The
reason is, that this technology is \"2D-scalable\" in computing power
and power consumption. Android would doesn\'t work good without ARM
processors. And with the first Tablets: Also Microsoft will be start in
a software design which has to consider computer power versus energy
consumption in future and - not only for tablets.\
\
@ Orbiter:\
\
So we should think about the future user home: The most systems from
today, which are comparable to our desktops and Laptops, will be
replaced by systems which work really only when the user is sitting in
front of the terminal of this system. The other time these systems are
completely down. But the cloud-system for each user is waiting for use
all the time (24/7). This is what we know as NAS today. -\> When we need
a distributed search and indexing system, so the aim must be to place
the software on these systems.\
\
And, I think you will be are right, it is very important to bring YaCy
also be fit by running on such small-power systems. My opinion: Not
RasPi will be important in future. (But it is a good test environment.)
Important will be a common ARM platform as any device what can also run
services which are not implemented by the producer of this device.
