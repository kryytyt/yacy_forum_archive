[Seattle police unveil blurred, soundless body cam YouTube
channel](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/seattle-police-unveil-blurred-soundless-body-cam-youtube-channel/)

> [The
> channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcdSPRNt1HmzkTL9aSDfKuA/videos)
> is already controversial because of its redaction tactics, and it
> comes as a presidential task force about the nation\'s policing
> recommended that police wear body cameras. The body cam channel
> features seemingly Soviet-era-like footage, and it\'s already being
> criticized. That criticism comes from Tim Clemans, the Washington
> state computer programmer who is redacting or blurring the video and
> removing voices on behalf of the police department.
>
> \"I\'m having to work with people who don\'t want this released
> period. There\'s a number of people trying to put up every obstacle
> possible,\" Clemans said. Clemans is doing it for free. The redaction
> surgery usually takes about one minute per minute of footage, he said.
> He runs it through \"five lines of open source code.\"
>
> The agency is redacting more from the footage than what\'s required
> under the state\'s public record laws, he said.
>
> \"The department does not want to post raw video on its YouTube
> channel. It fears a privacy controversy,\" he said.
>
> The department is burning as many as 7,000 DVDs monthly to meet public
> demand for information. The agency has more than 1.5 million videos
> taking up 364 terabytes. The footage includes dash cam video, 911
> responses, and \"interviews with victims, witnesses and suspects.\"
>
> Clemans understands that the agency can\'t keep up with demands. He
> said that public disclosure through the YouTube channel is a \"middle
> ground\" of sorts. \[\...\]
>
> Clemens hooked up with the Seattle Police Department after he rattled
> the agency last year by filing more than 30 public-information
> requests on every 911 emergency call in which officers responded. The
> demand included dash cam and body cam footage.

*I expect to see this stuff used as raw material in some [Pattern
Recognition](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2010/12/in-praise-of-iamamiwhoami/)-style
videos. Please get right on that.*
