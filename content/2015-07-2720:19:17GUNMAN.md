[![](http://www.jwz.org/images/selectricball_525.jpg)How the Soviets
bugged *typewriters* in the US Embassy from 1976 through
1984.](https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_histories/learning_from_the_enemy.pdf)

*This is an amazing story, and I also love that one of the players in
this drama is named \"Bob Surprise\".*

> The typewriter bugs marked a new level of sophistication because they
> were electromechanical. For the first time, the Soviets gathered
> information from a piece of equipment that held written plain text
> information. Prior to the discovery of these bugs, the U.S. believed
> that the Russians had only used room audio bugs with micro- phones or
> listening devices to eavesdrop on American embassy activities.
> \[\...\]
>
> A total of sixteen bugs were found in twelve IBM Selectric II
> typewriters and four IBM Selectric III typewriters. Common features
> were found in all sixteen typewriters: six ferromagnetic magnetizable
> balls were replaced with six nonferromagnetic nonmagnetizable balls
> with a very strong magnet in the tip; all the typewriters contained a
> modified comb support bar which housed the bug; all used burst
> transmissions at the 30, 60, or 90 MHz range via radio frequency.
> \[\...\]
>
> Each implant had a magnetometer that converted the mechanical energy
> of key strokes into local magnetic disturbances. The electronics
> package in the implant responded to these disturbances, categorized
> the underlying data, and transmitted the results to a nearby listening
> post. Data were transmitted via radio frequency. The implant was
> enabled by remote control. Another advantage of these bugs was easy
> installation. Engineers estimated that a skilled technician could
> install an implant in a typewriter in a half hour. The integrated
> circuits were very sophisticated for that time period. The circuits
> contained one bit core memory, an advancement that NSA engineers had
> never seen. \[\...\]
>
> In reality, the movement of the balls determined which character had
> been typed because each character had a unique binary movement
> corresponding to the balls. The magnetic energy picked up by the
> sensors in the bar was converted into a digital electrical signal. The
> signals were compressed into a four-bit frequency select word. The bug
> was able to store up to eight four-bit characters. When the buffer was
> full, a transmitter in the bar sent the information out to Soviet
> sensors.
>
> There was some ambiguity in determining which characters had been
> typed. NSA analysts using the laws of probability were able to figure
> out how the Soviets probably recovered text. Other factors which made
> it difficult to recover text included the following: The implant could
> not detect characters that were typed without the ball moving. If the
> typist pressed space, tab shift, or backspace, these characters were
> invisible to the implant. Since the ball did not move or tilt when the
> typist pressed hyphen because it was located at the ball\'s home
> position, the bug could not read this character either.

If you enjoy this kind of thing, you should watch *The Americans*. It\'s
a really fun show. There were times when I was watching *Agent Carter*
and I forgot which show I was watching because they\'re basically both
about the Hydra Black Widow Program, but one of them has more boning and
the other has more kung fu.
