======================================

``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
update Maven pom - add release-profile
to create the release archive only if profile is activated (speeding up normal compilation)
- bind install of the 2 jar's not available in repository to validate phase (was clean)
  to automatically add these to local repository (with disadvantage it's done every time)
```
