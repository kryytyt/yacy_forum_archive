[The Unintended Consequences of Changes in Beverage Options and the
Removal of Bottled Water on a University
Campus](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302593)

> Results. Per capita shipments of bottles, calories, sugars, and added
> sugars increased significantly when bottled water was removed.
> Shipments of healthy beverages declined significantly, whereas
> shipments of less healthy beverages increased significantly. As
> bottled water sales dropped to zero, sales of sugar-free beverages and
> sugar-sweetened beverages increased.
>
> Conclusions. The bottled water ban did not reduce the number of
> bottles entering the waste stream from the university campus, the
> ultimate goal of the ban. With the removal of bottled water, consumers
> increased their consumption of less healthy bottled beverages.
