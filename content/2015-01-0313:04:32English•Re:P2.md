2.\
Are there instructions anywhere to safely convert or even Migrate the
data in the Robinson servers to that DHT P2P new environment of the new
servers, please?\
The 2 oldest Robinson servers (of 3) are full and totally out of space,
so we need to move the data.\
We want to have the entire group in P2P DHT, in the end. (No more
Robinson servers)\
What are our options, please?\
