Semicircle:](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-unsettling-mystery-of-the-creepiest-channel-on-youtube)

> Until early February, unfavorable semicircle was uploading videos at a
> rate of just over one every 10 minutes. But since February 5, that
> rate has skyrocketed, increasing to something like three videos each
> minute \-- meaning that the channel will surpass 200,000 total videos
> by the end of March. \[\...\]
>
> Encoded in thousands of unfavorable semicircle\'s videos is The Voice:
> unmistakably that of a man, usually speaking a single letter or
> number, or speaking a string of letters and numbers, each with no
> apparent connection to each other. \[\...\]
>
> The average length of each of the videos is five seconds, and they
> adhere to a few naming conventions. The names of the first several
> thousand, for example, begin with a symbol
> (![♐](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/2650.png){.wp-smiley})
> followed by a seemingly random series of digits. Others have purely
> random names. The last 28,000 videos have started with \"BRILL\" and
> are numbered in ascending fashion.

> Many Redditors think the key to decrypting the videos lies in two of

today \"This account has been suspended due to multiple or severe

\"Policy against gaming\" is one I haven\'t heard before.
