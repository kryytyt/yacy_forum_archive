Hi ouahpiti,\
you can of course carefully customize the defaults/solrconfig.xml file
in your YaCy install, but regarding spell checking, to my mind it won\'t
be very useful because the suggestions Solr would produce would not be
used by the YaCy custom search code. Instead you should have a look at
the
[DidYouMean](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/blob/5a14d34a7dd07cb1ce249538d4b45ee39790d785/source/net/yacy/data/DidYouMean.java){.postlink}
Java class.\
\
If you need more help with that, I suggest you provide here, or even
better in a new GitHub or Mantis issue, some examples of failing search
terms and expected results.\
\
Best regards
