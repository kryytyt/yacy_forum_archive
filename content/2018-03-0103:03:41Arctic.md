alarming heatwave in the sunless winter Arctic is causing blizzards in
Europe and forcing scientists to reconsider even their most pessimistic
forecasts of climate

> The north pole gets no sunlight until March, but an influx of warm air
> has pushed temperatures in Siberia up by as much as 35C above
> historical averages this month. Greenland has already experienced 61
> hours above freezing in 2018 - more than three times as many hours as
> in any previous year.
>
> Seasoned observers have described what is happening as \"crazy,\"
> \"weird,\" and \"simply shocking\".
>
> \"This is an anomaly among anomalies. It is far enough outside the
> historical range that it is worrying \-- it is a suggestion that there
> are further surprises in store as we continue to poke the angry beast
> that is our climate,\" said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System
> Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. \[\...\]
>
> But the heat peaks are becoming more frequent and lasting longer \--
> never more so than this year. \"In 50 years of Arctic reconstructions,
> the current warming event is both the most intense and one of the
> longest-lived warming events ever observed during winter,\" said
> Robert Rohde, lead scientist of Berkeley Earth, a non-profit
> organisation dedicated to climate science. \[\...\]
>
> \"This is too short-term an excursion to say whether or not it changes
> the overall projections for Arctic warming,\" says Mann. \"But it
> suggests that we may be underestimating the tendency for short-term
> extreme warming events in the Arctic. And those initial warming events
> can trigger even greater warming because of the \'feedback loops\'
> associated with the melting of ice and the potential release of
> methane (a very strong greenhouse gas).\"
