A round-up on why Uber is awful
===============================

Date: 2017-03-02 00:35:17

![](https://www.jwz.org/images/deleteuberphonescreenshot-488.jpg)Maybe
you deleted the Uber app when they [scabbed the deportation
protest](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/02/01/deleteuber-is-introducing-a-new-generation-to-the-horror-of-scabbing/)
in New York, then re-installed it the next day because convenience
outweighed your momentary dalliance with having principles. So here\'s a
brief round-up of reasons why you should have stopped giving them your
money years ago.

I had hoped that I could just find someone else\'s round-up of all the
reasons, but now I understand why I couldn\'t: there are *so many* and
it\'s *such a moving target*.

Let\'s dive right in:

    Outside of the internal pressure, Uber faced other fallout from Mr.
    Kalanick\'s stance. More than 200,000 customers had deleted their
    accounts.
