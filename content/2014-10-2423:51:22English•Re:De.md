More people might try Yacy out if there is a demo SSL sort of URL
connection.\
I did a test to my Twitter feed yesterday and found I had a log file of
66 k pretty quickly and today some 12 hours later its now 244k. Note \"I
does not contain any IP\'s\"\
If you go to /Network.html?page=1&maxCount=1000 you should see a little
black lock next to SSL enabled peers. However I have noticed when I look
at my other peer from each peer there not showing up as SSL Enabled.\

Interesting looks like someone should add it to the DEV Wishlist, beyond
me.\
