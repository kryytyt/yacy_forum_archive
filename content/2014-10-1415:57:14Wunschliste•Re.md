Wunschliste â€¢ Re: Whitelist
===========================

we found that whitelists are impracticable in some way, i.e. chances
that you put something in your whitelist is the same as someone sends to
you are really small, considering the size of the web. I would recommend
that you turn the whitelist you have in mind into a crawl-list which you
start on your peer and then close the incoming connections completely
which you can do in /ConfigNetwork\_p.html by removal of the flag
\"Index Receive\". This turns your peer into a halve-robinson: your peer
distributes the index you created to other peers (your peer keeps a
copy!) but your peer is still available for search from other peers.
