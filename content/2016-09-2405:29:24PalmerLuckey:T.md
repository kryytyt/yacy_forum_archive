character on *Law & Order* it would be just more implausible, hack

exist?](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/22/palmer-luckey-the-facebook-billionaire-secretly-funding-trump-s-meme-machine.html)

> Oculus founder Palmer Luckey financially backed a pro-Trump political
> organization called Nimble America, a self-described \"social welfare
> 501(c)4 non-profit\" in support of the Republican nominee.
>
> Luckey sold his virtual reality company Oculus to Facebook for \$2
> billion in 2014. The 24-year-old told The Daily Beast that he had used
> the pseudonym \"NimbleRichMan\" on Reddit with a password given to him
> by the organization\'s founders.

*(This does not sound like a robust password management regime to me.)*

> Nimble America says it\'s dedicated to proving that \"shitposting is
> powerful and meme magic is real,\" according to the company\'s
> introductory statement, and has taken credit for a billboard its
> founders say was posted outside of Pittsburgh with a cartoonishly
> large image of Clinton\'s face alongside the words \"Too Big to
> Jail.\"
>
> \"We conquered Reddit and drive narrative on social media, conquered
> the \[mainstream media\], now it\'s time to get our most delicious
> memes in front of Americans whether they like it or not,\" a
> representative for the group wrote in an introductory post on Reddit.
> \[\...\]
>
> \"I\'ve got plenty of money,\" Luckey added. \"Money is not my issue.
> I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time.\" \[\...\]
>
> Luckey first met the alt-right provocateur in Los Angeles about a year
> and a half ago, before Yiannopoulos began working on a charity to send
> white men to college. The Daily Beast later reported that the
> scholarship fund had resulted in zero financial distribution of the
> donations that had been made directly to Yiannopoulos\'s bank account.
> \[\...\]
>
> Along with Luckey, Nimble America was founded by two moderators of
> Reddit\'s r/The\_Donald, which helped popularize Trump-themed white
> supremacist and anti-Semitic memes along with 4Chan and 8Chan. A
> questionnaire to become a moderator at r/The\_Donald posted in March
> had applicants answer the questions \"Is there a difference between
> white nationalism and white supremacy?\" and \"Was 9/11 an inside
> job?\"
