YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: Social Media Ranking
=====================================================

Hi Orbiter, I think it would be great to help YaCy with all these data
gathered by loklak. But I wonder if the new field added to YaCy index
should not rather be a raw value such as the links number from social
medias, rather than an already processed ranking value. Wouldn\'t it be
more clear for users and also allow finer tuning and customization of
ranking on this new field?
