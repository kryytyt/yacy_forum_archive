================================================

We are needing to index everything locally, so this means we need to
turn this ON.\
These are independent Robinson servers, that read each other but write
locally.\
How do we turn that on manually, please? We do not have access to the
admin screens, obviously\
As written elsewhere\

Apparently it is this that needs resetting manually, but where is it and
what to do, please?\
Thanks\
