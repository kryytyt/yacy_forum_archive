> They were voracious predators, gobbling up anything that crossed their

> the \'Cambrian explosion\', a period of rapid evolutionary development
> about half a billion years ago, when most major animal groups first
> appear in the fossil record.

> \"Modern penis worms have been pushed to the margins of life,
> generally living in extreme underwater environments,\" added Dr Smith.
> \"But during the Cambrian, they were fearsome beasts, and extremely
> successful ones at that.\"

> This crazy, hairpiece-looking clump of yellow fluff is actually a rare
> caterpillar that only looks like Donald Trump\'s hair.
>
> Interestingly, and coincidentally, approaching the Donald Trump
> Caterpillar (scientific name: Megalopyge opercularis) can be very
> dangerous, particularly if you come in contact with the business end
> of its yellow mane.
>
> \"If you touch that thing, it would seriously hurt,\" Torres, a field
> biologist, told the UK Daily Mail. \"It has these little hairs that
> can poke into your skin and release a venom.\"
>
> Just like the real Donald Trump. How uncanny!
