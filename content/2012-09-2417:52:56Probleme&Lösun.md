Hi again.\
\
Orbiter, your last post got me thinking and it seems like I solved my
issue, what really happened I do not know.\
\
This is what i did.\
\
I downgraded my node to 1.1/9069, tested it and my issue was not
reproducable (As I expected)\
I then deleted the 1.1/9086 release that the node presented as
available, downloaded 1.1/9086 again an installed it.\
My so far limited testing indicates that things are back to normal and
that I once again can use the node as both Proxy and searchengine
![:D](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif "Very Happy")\
\
I am suspecting that something went wrong when I first updated to
1.1/9086, dunno what though.\
\
Thanx for your time, hopefully my node will run as intented now.\
