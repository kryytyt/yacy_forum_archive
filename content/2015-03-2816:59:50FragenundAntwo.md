Fragen und Antworten • New Segments set in New YaCy blocks startup
==================================================================

HI\...\
In a previous post we got instructions that to move the core data from
ALLIP in a small server to a much larger environment, we needed to
collect the SEGMENTS folder which contains default, Solr\_4\_10 and
firstseen.index to a new installation of YaCy.\
\
This we did.\
We installed a healthy fresh YaCy in the cloud, based on the latest
Ubuntu long term support\
Then shutting it down, via SSH we erased the generic Segments folder and
all of its contents\
The data segments set we are moving by SSH in total has 17.7 GB\
We copied the desired Segments folder from the home folder to the ALLIP
folder space, as before.\
Once it was in there, we updated Ubuntu and attempted upgrade of YaCy
(which was already the latest version)\
Then we rebooted Ubuntu from SSH\
\
What we find:\
YaCy starts then shuts down by itself\
We also executed a hard reboot from the cloud provider\'s interface.\
= No change in behavior\
\
We can go into the command line by SSH and call\

> <div>
>
> \
> sudo /etc/init.d/yacy restart\
>
> </div>

\
\
it returns:\

> <div>
>
> \
> not running\
>
> </div>

.\
Then\

> <div>
>
> \
> Starting YaCy P2P Web Search: yacy.\
>
> </div>

\
However,\
It never starts completely with the new segment set and apparently shuts
down\
We can never get back to the proven working engine visible in the
browser - yet with the new segments set.\
We have done this test with two different sets of segments on two clouds
of new YaCy installations\
Results are the same\
\
Interestingly, this process worked before, some weeks ago.\
Is there something in the new YaCy which does not allow changing
Segments sets?\
How do we disable this, please?\
Or is the problem somewhere else, please?\
Many thanks
