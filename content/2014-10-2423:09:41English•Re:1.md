Have you checked the queries.log to see how much work the peer is
doing?\
If it is no more or less than the good one I would consider a backup and
create a 3rd machine and I think you restore the data directory to the
new os with a fresh install of yacy on it. I would need someone to
confirm how to do it though. In the past I have had problems with a VPS
and I ended up destroying it and starting again.\
How do you access your machines by IP or DNS eg
<http://smokingwheels.evils.in:8090> If it is DNS I would go to
<http://www.webpagetest.org/> and test both servers, go to the advanced
settings and set 9 tests then look at the waterfall graphs and check the
response time, on my server it sometimes takes 10-30 seconds to load the
DNS redirect.\

Its probably got to do with the swap file setting thats my guess\
\
I tried a second VPS Debian system yesterday on a SATA and its Load time
for the yacy search page was about 50% faster than my SSD but I will see
how it is today. I mention this because you are running out of space on
one of your servers.
