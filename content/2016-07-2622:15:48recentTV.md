![](https://www.jwz.org/images/videodrome-2.jpg)In lieu of sleeping, I
watch television. I have opinions. In no particular order, here\'s some
stuff I\'ve watched recently:

-   **Preacher:** This is the best thing on TV right now, and is an
    amazingly faithful adaptation of the comics. I haven\'t read them in
    years, but I loved the shit out of them back in the day, and so far
    this is doing justice to all of the characters. Cassidy, especially,
    is *spot on*. The TV version of Tulip is *much* more interesting,
    too: in the show she\'s a person, but in the comic she was The
    Girlfriend. The first season seems to be building to Jesse giving
    *The Sermon* in the finale, and just about every episode ends with
    an \"Oh shit, here it comes\" feeling. I am loving this so much.
-   **Mr. Robot:** Season one was absolutely incredible in every
    particular. It\'s impossible to talk about my favorite parts without
    massive spoilers, but there\'s a bit where they do *a cliché thing*
    and you\'re thinking \"Oh, you\'re not going to do *the cliché
    thing* are you?\" and then there\'s an instrumental music cue that
    is the most perfect music cue of all time because in just a few
    seconds it says, \"Not only are we doing *the cliché thing* but we
    know it and we know you know it and we are going *all in* on *the
    cliché thing*.\"

    Also: it is best to view *Mr. Robot* as a sequel to [*Pump Up the
    Volume*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100436/) in much the same way
    that [*Grosse Point Blank*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119229/) is
    a sequel to [*Say Anything*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098258)
    (Lloyd Dobbler found that kickboxing didn\'t work out and joined the
    army) and that [*Don\'t Trust the Bitch in Apartment
    23*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1819509/) is the prequel to
    *Jessica Jones* (back when Jessica and Patsy lived together before
    meeting Killgrave \-- Jessica was way more fun and less uptight back
    then).

    Anyway, season two of *Mr. Robot* is not really impressing me yet. I
    hope they get their shit together.

-   **The Magicians:** It took me a few episodes to warm to this,
    because I have no time for Harry Potter (a series about how hard it
    is being the popular jock who\'s good at everything) and this series
    sounds like it\'s going to be \"Hogwarts, The Graduate School
    Years\", but it\'s not really that, and it gets pretty dark pretty
    fast, e.g., the \"C. S. Lewis / Lewis Carroll was a pedophile\"
    subplot. It feels much more \"real world\" than most shows about
    magic do, and the characters actually have recognizable
    personalities. This show is excellent.
-   **The Expanse:** This might be the best science fiction I\'ve ever
    seen on TV. It\'s actually science fiction, not \"a western in
    spaaaace\" like so much that passes for it is. The world-building is
    amazingly complex, the politics seem sensible, it has good
    characterizations, and probably the best physics I\'ve seen in a
    scifi TV or movie since *2001.* The writers *understand gravity and
    inertia* if you can believe that. I know, right?
-   **Stranger Things:** I would like to thank everyone who has been
    *raving* about this show for being so vocal about it, and thereby
    letting me know that I should utterly disregard your opinion on
    everything, ever. This is the biggest piece of trash I\'ve seen
    since\... well, since the last piece of saccharine pabulum that
    Spielberg vomited onto the screen. It\'s a ham-handed Spielberg /
    Stephen King pastiche, and it\'s *just as bad* as the warmed over,
    Very Special Episode 80s crap it is imitating, but nostalgia is a
    hell of a drug, so the fact that it is doing a decent job of
    imitating barely-remembered *crap* passes for depth with a lot of
    people, I guess?

    This is a show that had Amnesia Psychic Girl actually say the line,
    \"Friend? What is *friend?*\"

    Someone actually wrote that down. Someone wrote that down and
    thought, \"Yes! Nailed it!\"

    There is a makeover montage. A god damned *makeover montage.*

    It\'s basically this:

    ::: {style="text-align: center; width: 100%; max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto;"}
    :::

-   **Orphan Black:** Still amazing. Watch this show! If you are even
    remotely considering watching *Sense8*, stop that, and watch this
    instead, because anything that was interesting in *Sense8* was
    already covered by *Orphan Black* by season 3, and in a less stupid
    way, and using characters you actually give a shit about (most of
    whom are played by the same person, which I still can hardly
    believe).
-   **Wynonna Earp:** This show is pretty dumb, but it\'s fun-dumb in
    the way mid-series *Supernatural* was dumb (the period when they
    kind of just said \"fuck it\" to making any sense, but before they
    ran out of ideas). The first few episodes are kind of hard to take,
    mostly because the writers didn\'t seem to be in agreement over
    whether the little sister\'s character was supposed to be 16 or 25,
    but it picks up. There\'s a lot of shooting demons in the face, and
    it\'s the most \"open carry\" show I\'ve ever seen. I wonder what
    part of Canada is standing in for Arizona here.
-   **Fear the Walking Dead:** This show exists solely to remind you
    that *The Walking Dead* could be *so much worse*. You will love this
    show if you watched *The Walking Dead* and said to yourself, \"You
    know what this show was missing? All of the incuriosity, pointless
    secret-keeping and one-note unsympathetic non-characters that I came
    to expect from *Lost*.\" This show is the walking embodiment of,
    \"Why did the character decide to do the thing? Because the plot
    demanded it.\" Fuck this show.
-   **Dark Matter:** I call this \"Amnesia Firefly\". If you give your
    characters amnesia, they don\'t have to have personalities! If you
    keep giving them amnesia over and over again, you can keep rewriting
    the same episode! Avoid.
-   **Killjoys:** It\'s another *Firefly* ripoff, and it\'s not a whole
    lot better, but at least two of the characters have something
    approaching motivation. There seems to be some complex
    world-building in the background, but it\'s a slow reveal.
-   **Powers:** The first half of season one was pretty lousy, but it
    picked up (naked Eddie Izzard eating people! how can you not love
    that!), and season two is getting good. If you watched the first
    season of *Heroes* and wanted to throw things at the TV the whole
    time, this might be the show that you wished that was.
-   **Penny Dreadful:** Or, \"The League of Extraordinarily Bloody
    Gentlemen\". Season one was perfection. Season two was pretty good.
    Season three was a betrayal: just avoid it.
-   **Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt:** I find this show hilarious.
    Apparently the people who do not find this show hilarious are people
    who did not find *30 Rock* hilarious. So let that be your guide.
-   **Crazy Ex-Girlfriend:** Ok, stay with me here. This is actually a
    *musical*. Like, a full-on, people stop talking and break into song
    and dance numbers three times an episode *musical*. How did this
    happen? How is this a thing that exists? How is this so *funny?*
    Because it\'s really funny. It\'s as if *Kimmy Schmidt* was produced
    by Bialystock and Bloom.
-   **Black Sails:** There is really a lot of excellent pirating in this
    show. Excellent pirating. Pirating and whoring and quite a lot of
    historically accurate pubic hair. The seasons tend to bog down and
    get a little talky in the middle, but they bookend it with some
    amazing naval battles. And even when it\'s talky, it\'s pretty
    great. Like this:

    > Flint: That\'s not why you did it.
    >
    > Silver: Really? Would you like to tell me why I did it, then?
    >
    > Flint: Well, I wasn\'t there, but, I\'d hazard the guess that you
    > learned of what had happened, told him how fucking stupid he was,
    > and in that moment, he gave you a look that amounted to something
    > less than contrite. And in that moment, you felt it.
    >
    > Silver: Felt what?
    >
    > Flint: Darkness. Hate. Showing indifference to the authority that
    > you sacrificed so much to acquire, disdain for refusing to
    > acknowledge that his actions, had you not intervened, would have
    > led to an outcome that he would have held you responsible for
    > reversing. Pride. Questioning what kind of man you are if you
    > don\'t seek retribution for the offense.
    >
    > Silver: So what are you saying? You saying I went too far with
    > him?
    >
    > Flint: Maybe you went too far. Maybe you didn\'t go far enough.
    > Maybe you did it just right. The point is that while you were
    > doing it, you heard a voice telling you that disciplining him
    > would prevent him from repeating the offense, a voice that sounded
    > like reason, and there was reason to it, as the most compelling
    > lies are comprised almost entirely of the truth. But that\'s what
    > it does. Cloaks itself in whatever it must to move you to action.
    > And the more you deny its presence, the more powerful it gets, and
    > the more likely it is to consume you entirely without you ever
    > even knowing it was there. Now, if you and I are to lead these men
    > together, you must learn to know its presence well so that you may
    > use it \... Rather than it use you.

    Also, it\'s a prequel to *Treasure Island*. You don\'t need to know
    anything about *Treasure Island* to follow it, but if you want to, I
    recommend [the 1934 version](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025907/).

-   **Outlander:** Our protagonist\'s problem is that she\'s just too
    smart and too good at everything, and too many people keep falling
    in love with her, so she keeps needing to be rescued by a brooding
    shirtless kilt. This is the most \"Mary Sue\" thing I have ever seen
    in my life. It\'s awful.
-   **Lucifer:** Speaking of Mary Sues, this show is basically identical
    to *Castle:* that is to say, \"I don\'t give a shit about your
    stupid mismatched-buddy-cop police procedural \-- oh, no chief,
    please don\'t partner me with the witty and charming outsider\" \--
    but I watched it for a few episodes because that guy *is* kind of
    charming. But yeah, I gave up on it.
-   **Ash vs Evil Dead:** So, remember that scene, where Bruce Campbell
    is fighting his possessed hand and it keeps smashing plates over his
    head? If you want to see a series that is basically that scene over
    and over again, this is the series for you. (Note: I do, and so this
    is the series for me.)
-   **Another Period:** This is the actually-watchable version of
    *Downton Abbey*.
-   **Outcast:** How can you make exorcisms *so boring?*
-   **12 Monkeys:** This is pretty lousy, and it\'s clear at this point
    that the writers have no plan at all, and are going to just keep
    palimpsesting over the plot as needed to keep it going. Bleh. But
    you have to admire what\'s-his-name\'s commitment to maintaining 5
    days of stubble. It\'s a *Miami Vice* level of tonsorial devotion.
-   **Blindspot, Gotham, The Strain:** These shows are bullshit.
