``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
added a new facet type based on a probabilistic classifier using
bayesian filters. This can be used to classify documents during
indexing-time using a pre-definied bayesian filter.

New wordings:
- a context is a class where different categories are possible. The
context name is equal to a facet name.
- a category is a facet type within a facet navigation. Each context
must have several categories, at least one custom name (things you want
to discover) and one with the exact name "negative".

To use this, you must do:
- for each context, you must create a directory within
DATA/CLASSIFICATION with the name of the context (the facet name)
- within each context directory, you must create text files with one
document each per line for every categroy. One of these categories MUST
have the name 'negative.txt'.

Then, each new document is classified to match within one of the given
categories for each context.
