> "When it comes to how we should deal with evil doers, the Bible, in
> the book of Romans, is very clear: God has endowed rulers full power
> to use whatever means necessary --- including war --- to stop evil,"
> Jeffress said. "In the case of North Korea, God has given Trump
> authority to take out Kim Jong Un."
