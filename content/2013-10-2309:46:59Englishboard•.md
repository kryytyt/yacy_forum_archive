[German Search Engine MetaGer with protected privacy now available in
English language]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
\
MetaGer, Germany\'s most popular meta search engine, launches
English-language version at <http://metager.net>\
\
Edward Snowden, a contract employee at the National Security Agency
(NSA), made headlines after highlighting the very active nature of the
US \'Patriot Act\': It grants US authorities unrestricted access to US
internet servers. Although its existence has been publicly known since
the adoption of the Patriot Act in 2001 (1), the extend of its use had
not fully been recognised until Snowden brought it to light and
illustrated the implications of the US government\'s extensive cyber
surveillance program.\
\
Following Snowden's public release, a number of online search engines
were quick to clarify that their systems did not store users\' IP
addresses, in an attempt to highlight the safe and user data protecting
nature of their services. However, despite their statements being true,
most of the companies host at least part of their servers in the US,
meaning that they are liable to the Patriot Act and US law, and so at
the hands of US authorities. Consequently, no such protected privacy can
be offered.\
\
All of this has driven us to implement an English-language version of
the most popular German meta search engine \'MetaGer', which evolved
from the Leibniz University of Hannover:\
metager.net\
\
[Others just talk - we act!]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
\
MetaGer is non-commercial, run by the German NGO \'SUMA-EV - Association
for Free Access to Knowledge\' (2). It relies little on advertising as a
source of income, instead being financed largely by donations and
SUMA-EV membership fees.\
\
In MetaGer fashion, searches carried out at metager.net are treated as
anonymous from an early stage; IP addresses are neither recorded nor
stored, and information is not passed on to other search engines.
Cooperations have been established with most of the global Internet
search engines, with news search provided by internet news portal One
News Page (3) being the latest addition. MetaGer does not operate any
servers outside of Germany and so falls exclusively under the infamously
tough German data protection laws. MetaGer is recommended as the first
choice for a search engine by the German \"Foundation for the Protection
of Privacy\" (4), which was founded by the Federal Republic of Germany.\
