Wunschliste â€¢ No More 404s -View a saved version courtesy of the Wayback M
==========================================================================

Date: 2016-08-13 08:52:58

For those of us using YaCy to create serious archives - and everyone
else!\
\
In [[[Firefox Test
pilot]{style="text-decoration: underline"}]{style="font-style: italic"}]{style="font-weight: bold"},\
There is a new Firefox add on to refer 404 pages to the WayBack Archive\
[\"View a saved version courtesy of the Wayback
Machine\"]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
<https://testpilot.firefox.com/>\
\
They write\

> <div>
>
> \
> Just Launched\
> No More 404s\
> Powered by the Wayback Machine\
> Tired of dead ends on the web?\
> We\'ll let you know when there\'s a saved version of what you\'re
> looking for on the Internet Archive\'s Wayback Machine.\
>
> </div>

\
\
[[Please, can we have the function in YaCy?\
This would be VERY
USEFUL!]{style="font-style: italic"}]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
\
The tools for it are Open Sourced - Firefox\
This is scheduled to become a standard part of Firefox\
\
Note: This is somewhat similar to the Cache Viewing \"Ressurect Pages\"
Firefox addon\
<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/resurrect-pages/>\
Which covers that and these\
o Google Cache\
o The Internet Archive\
o WebCite\
o archive.is\
\
This recoverable page option could be a very important function\
Beyond the current fundamental question of \"does it exist NOW\"\
This could be \'toggled\' in the user results, for example.\
\
This implementation as a Function to toggle [on a case by case
basis]{style="font-weight: bold"} in the results, will preserve several
important aspects of YaCy security and ALSO allow \'in depth\' research,
if needed.\
We have users asking for something like this kind of function - who want
to see \'lost\' archival type records no longer displayed.\
\
[Thank you, and in many languages!]{style="font-weight: bold"}
