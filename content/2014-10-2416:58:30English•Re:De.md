Why? Sorry, but i do not understand the intention of this task. I do not
know how many YaCy-Peers have SSL enabled (but i can implement a
Statistic-Value for this Information in my Tool if you wish), so i can
not say how useful is a List of this Peers. And guessing the Information
about the used Port is not a meaningful way, in my opinion.\

No, the Problem is: there exist multiple Ways to access a YaCy-Peer (one
or multiple IP-Addresses and a not limited Number of Domain-Names that
resolve to one or more of the IP-Addresses) and for fulfilling the
SSL-Paradigm YaCy need an extra Certificate for
[each]{style="text-decoration: underline"} Way (and Browser that support
this: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>, most
Browsers do <https://sni.velox.ch/>).\

I think RFC6698 can be a Solution. The primary intention of my Tool is
to be a DNS-Server for the both YaCy-Top-Level-Domains .yacy and .yacyh,
so there exist soon a possible Way to solve this Problem.\
