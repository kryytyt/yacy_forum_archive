I see that this feature is now really missing to operate YaCy on limited
devices like a RPi. There is not a single reason that this feature is
not yet realized but many:\
- time for development\
- unanswered deletion strategies (delete least accessed, oldest?)\
- a missing architecture for the deletion (two databases - RWI and
Metadata/Solr - must be cleaned in balance and efficiency for that is
not easy), and\
- the philosophical contradiction (a search engine which rejects
censoring deletes it\'s own data).\
\
There are also some administration questions, like\
- should \'auto-delete\' be a default setting if resources are not
available (if not set by default, most people will not enable it so it
does not work as peer-protection)\
- should the limit be set by remaining space (\"df .\" does not work on
all systems) or to-occupy-space (requires frequent counting of all file
sizes in DATA)
