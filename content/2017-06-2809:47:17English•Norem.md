English â€¢ No remote results in peer-to-peer mode
================================================

Date: 2017-06-28 09:47:17

I downloaded Yacy from the Master branch at the height of [yesterday\'s
latest
commit](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commit/9b1bb2545e4d40f542e91049a8e3799f2593d8c3){.postlink}
by luc.\
\
Then\
\

Code: 
:   `ant clean all`

and started Yacy. The configuration is all default except for the
following:\

\
Port on NAT is open, the peer is reachable from the outside at:
<http://87.19.240.129:8090>\
\
The problem is I never receive search results from remote peers, only
local results are displayed, even after leaving Yacy running and
crawling overnight.
