> These three visions lead to radically different worlds.

> If you think the Web is a way to CONNECT KNOWLEDGE, PEOPLE, AND CATS,
> then your job is to get the people and cats online, put a decent font
> on the knowledge, and then stand back and watch the magic happen.
>
> If you think your job is to FIX THE WORLD WITH SOFTWARE, then the web
> is just the very beginning. There\'s a lot of work left to do. Really
> you\'re going to need sensors in every house, and it will help if
> everyone looks through special goggles, and if every refrigerator can
> talk to the Internet and confess its contents.
>
> You promise to hook up all this stuff up for us, and in return, we
> give you the full details of our private lives. And we don\'t need to
> worry about people doing bad things with it, because your policy is
> for that not to happen.
>
> And if you think that the purpose of the Internet is to BECOME AS
> GODS, IMMORTAL CREATURES OF PURE ENERGY LIVING IN A CRYSTALLINE
> PARADISE OF OUR OWN INVENTION, then your goal is total and complete
> revolution. Everything must go. \[\...\]
>
> I realize this all sounds a little grandiose. You came here to hear
> about media selectors, not aviation and eschatology. But you all need
> to pick a side.
