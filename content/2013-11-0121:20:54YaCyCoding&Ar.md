YaCy Coding & Architektur â€¢ DHT seedlist bug in mode any
========================================================

Date: 2013-11-01 21:20:54

Hello!\
\
We are facing a problem when trying to use DHT.\
\
network.unit.domain = local works with only private addresses
(10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16)\
\
network.unit.domain = global does not allow us to use .onion domains as\
a crawling target as they are not globally accessible in yacy\'s point
of\
view.\
\
network.unit.domain = any makes it impossible possible to upload
seedlist which we consider as a BUG.\
\
All url\'s and methods will be rejected with message of\
\
seedURL in localhost rejected\
\
Please try it out, it does not need any special config.\
\
Best Regards,\
