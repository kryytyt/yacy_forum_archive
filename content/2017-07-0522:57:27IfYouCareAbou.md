headquarters Apple is building in Cupertino has the absolute best door
handles. The greatest!](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-campus/)

> Apple\'s new HQ is a retrograde, literally inward-looking building
> with contempt for the city where it lives and cities in general.
> \[\...\] By building a mega-headquarters straight out of the middle of
> the last century, Apple has exacerbated the already serious problems
> endemic to 21st-century suburbs like Cupertino \-- transportation,
> housing, and economics. Apple Park is an anachronism wrapped in glass,
> tucked into a neighborhood. \[\...\]
>
> Ten percent of people working in Cupertino means that 90 percent of
> the people in the Spaceship will commute. Most of them live in San
> Jose (10 miles east) and San Francisco (45 miles north). The lack of a
> cohesive regional transportation network in the Bay Area privileges
> cars, which is why Google and other tech companies started fielding
> their own buses in the last few years. \[\...\]
>
> Still, though\...Apple has \$250 billion in cash. Against that, these
> community benefits feel small. The company could have chipped in to
> double the frequency of CalTrain\'s commuter rail. It could have built
> a transit center in Cupertino, which, unlike Mountain View and Palo
> Alto, has none. \"Apple could have done anything. Money was no
> object,\" says Allison Arieff, editorial director for the San
> Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association and lead
> author of its recent report on corporate campuses. \"They want to be
> innovative in everything, and they\'re not innovative in this thing.\"
> Apple is instead making significant improvements to roads and
> highways. \"If the intractable problems of the region are housing and
> congestion, they\'re giving the finger to all that,\" Arieff says.
> \[\...\]
>
> So what could Apple have built? Something taller, with mixed-use
> development around it? Cupertino would never have allowed it. But
> putting form factor aside, the best, smartest designers and architects
> in the world could have tried something new. Instead it produced a
> building roughly the shape of a navel, and then gazed into it.
