YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Search or transfer
===============================================

Date: 2015-12-17 20:39:28

During search events we collect metadata from dht queries as well as
solrdocuments from solr direct queries.\
As \@luc pointed out (see <http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=626>) we
transfer documents \"to big to store\" during search.\
Should we not considere to tackle this at the root and in view of search
performance go back and exchange search results with exactly whats
needed for it (standardized search interface) and maybe enhance/expand
the dht transfer part to solrdocs, but go away from solr direct queries
/ returns of a remote peer index assumed to be similar to the local sorl
index?\
\
P.S. We basically have everything under the hood, from rwi query,
opensearch query, sru query, solr query \...\... but each used
differently.
