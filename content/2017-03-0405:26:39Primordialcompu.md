I need text-to-speech into the voices used to announce BART trains,
which are [Lucent / Bell Labs \"John\" and
\"Grace\"](http://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2009/news20090309), from
the mid 1990s. They sound [like
this](http://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/DSSAudioDemo.wav).
This is for purposes of Important Comedy.

If you can\'t find either of those precise voices, can you find
something pretty close?
