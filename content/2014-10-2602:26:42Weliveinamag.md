> Many shell users, and certainly most of the people working in computer

> It is much less known that the Linux version of strings is an integral
> part of GNU binutils, a suite of tools that specializes in the
> manipulation of several dozen executable formats using a bundled
> library called libbfd. Other well-known utilities in that suite
> include `objdump` and `readelf`. \[\...\]

> In any case: the bottom line is that if you are used to running
> `strings` on random files, or depend on any `libbfd`-based tools for
> forensic purposes, you should probably change your habits.
