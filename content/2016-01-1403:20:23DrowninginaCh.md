> The woman tried to adjust a metal grate that was not properly covering
> the 6- to 8-foot-deep concrete tank when she fell into it. The guard
> screamed for help but no one responded, so she called 911 and held
> onto the top of the tank with her other arm, Marsh said.

> \"She was waist deep and sinking and didn\'t know how deep the tank
> was,\" said Marsh, who told the woman to put her cellphone in her
> pocket and to hold onto the top of the tank with both arms.
