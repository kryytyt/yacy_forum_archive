Hello nap,\
\
running a Senior-Peer already does help the network by receiving DHT.
With this the index-data will grow and will be used for
search-requests.\
Starting a crawl will also help enrich the the index of the network.\
\
Indexing pages You visit can be done by using YaCy as a Web-Proxy of
your browser.\
Toggle transparent Proxy to be on at /Status.html and configure the
browser to use 127.0.0.1 (port 8090) as proxy for http.\
But using yacy as proxy has some limitations on some sites.\
Pages with personal data will not be indexed.\
