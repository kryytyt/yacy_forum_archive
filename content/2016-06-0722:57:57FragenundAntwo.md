Hi, YaCy is currently based on Solr and can even be used with an
external Solr server. So your idea makes sense.\
But I think the first problem you will be faced with these modules is
that they provide their own solr config and schema which of course is
different from the one used in YaCy. I am not sure how you could do the
mapping between these two\... Did you already tried some experiments?
