Improved previous merge "Show ranking in HTML UI".

- added the new setting as configurable in the "Debug/Analysis" settings
page. Debug/analysis is its main purpose for now as there is currently
no nice and "understansable" ranking score info servlet (see forum
discussion http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=5884 ) 
- render in the "Search Page Layout" page preview when enabled
- added constants
```
