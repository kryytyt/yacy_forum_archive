[Pneumatic Sponge Ball
Accelerator](http://www.niklasroy.com/project/174/PSBA)

> The apparatus contains 1000 black sponge balls, which are sucked
> through 150m of transparent pneumatic tubes with the power of a
> regular household vacuum cleaner. The balls travel with a speed of
> about 4m/s. Visitors can operate the machine with a touch sensor
> mounted on the pavilion\'s front glass: They can change the direction
> of the airflow and watch the balls speed up, slow down and reverse.
