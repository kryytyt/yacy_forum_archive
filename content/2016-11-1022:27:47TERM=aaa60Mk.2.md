[![](https://www.jwz.org/images/aaa60-1.jpg)](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/10/export-termaaa-60/)More
serial port shenanigans.

[In our last
episode](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/10/export-termaaa-60/), our
intrepid hero lamented the lack of hardware flow control on the
TTL-based something-like-a-serial-port that the Raspberry Pi provides.
Well, in the comments [someone pointed
out](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/10/export-termaaa-60/#comment-169515)
that the Pi hardware actually *does* support flow control on the serial
line, after you [jump through some
hoops](https://github.com/mholling/rpirtscts) to activate the
\"secondary function mode\" on a couple of random pins. So I hooked that
up.

But, unsurprisingly, it did not just magically work on the first try.

There are any number of things that could be going wrong here, so the
first question I want to ask is probably, \"when the Pi attempts to turn
RTS on and off, does the light on my serial tester cable change state?\"

So like, how do I do that? How do I toggle the RTS line through
software?

Also, I\'m not 100% sure I\'m hooking up the right pins. Some sanity
checking, please?

(Fun fact that I managed to go my entire life until today without
realizing, which suddenly explains *so many things:* did you know that
the RS232 DB25 spec has TX/RX on pins 2/3, but the RS232 DB9 spec [swaps
them](http://www.pccompci.com/image008.jpg) to 3/2? And that is *not*
for a null modem.)

So. The DB25 on the terminal is using pins 2 (TX), 3 (RX), 4 (RTS) and
20 (DTR). Pin 5 (CTS) is wired to ground.

This has made me realize that I don\'t actually know the difference
between DTR and CTS. I thought they were synonyms, not different pins.
Uhhhh\...

So here\'s how I wired it up. TX/RX are swapped to null-modem it, as are
RTS/DTR. Does this seem right?

**Update:** No, that was wrong, I got turned around: CTS is *not* wired
to ground. However, there *is* a DTR with no corresponding DSR. So this
is more sensible:

Also, some questions about booting Debian, unrelated to serial ports:

The Raspbian install I\'m using uses systemd, and is presumably loading
a zillion services that I do not need like disk quotas, \"remote file
systems\", \"encrypted volumes\", etc. How do I tell what it\'s doing
and how do I identify and disable the useless cruft? (\"Replace systemd
with something else\" is a common suggestion that is [harder that it
sounds](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/11/buildroot/).)

Also how do I make DHCP be non-blocking, that is, get me to a login
prompt while the network is still negotiating?

And how do I make `rc.local` or something similar run as early as
possible? Right now it runs very near the end.
