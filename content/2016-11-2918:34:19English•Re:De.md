Hi kabads, if you let run continuously a YaCy peer you will see the
total number of connected peer varies depending on hours of the day on a
regular basis. But as far as know the \'principal\' and \'active
senior\' peers number is quite stable, around a few hundreds.\
Running your peer 24 hours a day will probably not let your peer reach a
greater total peers number at a time, but this way you will support the
network, and your peer will gather more diverse chunks from the globally
distributed index.\
\
Given the current size of the network, if you have some basic technical
skills, to my mind it makes sense to run continuously a server on a
dedicated machine, being either a physical one or a virtual machine
hosted somewhere you trust. And what\'s more, this way it won\'t consume
resources on your daily used computer/laptop/mobile hardware\...\
\
Best regards
