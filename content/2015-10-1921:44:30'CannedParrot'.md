[Terrific Street: Local
Heroes:](http://hoodline.com/2015/10/canned-parrot-display-angers-neighbors)

> We recently received a tip from Julie Herrod about a not-yet-opened
> business called Terrific Street, at 1534 Grant Ave. Herrod said that a
> new display in the upcoming store\'s window, featuring \"canned
> parrot,\" was \"the most disgusting thing I\'ve ever seen in North
> Beach in the 25 years I\'ve lived here.\" \[\...\]
>
> Herrod left an anonymous note in Terrific Street\'s mail slot, which
> reads: \"Your window display is a disgrace. Not at all funny, if
> that\'s what you think it is. You\'re in the wrong neighborhood. Shame
> on you.\"
>
> To her dismay, the owners of the business posted the note inside the
> window, along with a sign reading: \"Terrific Street: In the wrong
> neighborhood since 2015.\" Herrod found it \"mindboggling\" that
> they\'d post her note. \"I was baffled by it,\" she said.

> She left another note: \"You have just proved my point by making it
> your slogan. Thank you.\" They posted that, too. \[\...\]

To her credit, at least the grumpy neighbor stood up for her own opinion
and said, \"I am the person who is offended by this\", instead of taking
the far more traditional approach of, \"Offense might be caused, in the
passive voice, to someone, somewhere.\"

Also: The most disgusting thing you\'ve ever seen in North Beach? How
could canned parrot even be the most disgusting thing you\'ve *stepped
in* in North Beach?
