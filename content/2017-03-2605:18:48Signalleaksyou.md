Signal leaks your phone number to everyone in your contacts
===========================================================

[![](https://www.jwz.org/images/signal_goatse.png)](https://whispersystems.org/)When
you install [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/), it asks for access to
your contacts, and says very proudly, \"we don\'t upload your contacts,
it all stays on your phone.\"

And then it spams all of your contacts who have Signal installed,
without asking your first.

And it *shares your phone number* with everyone in your contacts who has
Signal installed.

And then when you scream ***ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME*** and delete
your account and purge the app, guess what? All those people running
Signal *still* have your phone number displayed for them right there in
plain text. Deleting your account does not delete the information that
the app shared without your permission.

So yeah. Real nice \"privacy\" app you\'ve got there, assholes.

I\'m going back to Facebook Messenger, where at least the privacy
failings are *obvious*.

PS: If you suddenly find yourself in possession of my phone number,
please don\'t share it, with anyone, ever. SIGH.
