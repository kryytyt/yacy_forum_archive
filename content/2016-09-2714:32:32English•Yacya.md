I like the concept of YaCy so I would test it. But I wonder if I will
not violate French law by indexing and thus accessing partly has
possibly illegal websites see very illegal (porn, weapons, drugs etc).\
\
so , do you know if indexing all kind of website was legal in france ?
and what risk I take using YaCy in France?\
\
Thanks in advance.\

Ps: it\'s me or search api in this forum was broken ?
