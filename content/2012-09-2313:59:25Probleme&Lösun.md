Hi.\
\
My deutsch is not that good so I translated the posts in this thread
with google and it seems to be about the same issue as I have.\
\
I am now running 1.1/9086 and when I try to use Yacy as a proxy or when
I make a search the \"Local Crawler\" queue grows out of control (almost
100000 pages in half an hour)\
The PPM meter goes down to 0 but the queue continues to grow so it seems
that yacy stops indexing at the right depth but still follows the links
on pages.\
\
As i had a hard time reading the translation to this thread my question
is, was a fix for this already deployed or is it scheduled for release?\
