Die gute Nachricht: Hillary Clinton benutzte einen Passwort-Manager,
damit sie starke PasswÃ¶rter benutzen kann, ohne sie zu vergessen.

Die schlechte Nachricht: [Es handelte sich um eine Person namens Monica
Hanley](https://twitter.com/FoiaTheThings/status/779499446648340480).

> CLINTON did not know her email login information, as HANLEY would
> generally change the information in CLINTON\'s BlackBerry when
> necessary so CLINTON\'s email would automatically populate. When
> CLINTON\'s password required changing, HANLEY would choose a new
> password, update CLINTON\'s BlackBerry with the change, and notify
> ABEDIN, COOPER and BRYAN PAGLIANO. HANLEY had CLINTON\'s email logon
> information and password, so she could check CLINTON\'s email if
> needed. On occasion, CLINTON would ask HANLEY to research an old email
> that CLINTON was unable to pull up on her BlackBerry. In order to
> respond said request, HANLEY would open up CLINTON\'s email account
> remotely from a computer and print the document for CLINTON. HANLEY
> assumed ABEDIN also accessed CLINTON\'s email account on occasion.
