Yes, i will show considerably more details for each Peer (if you know at
least the Name or the Hash of the Peer try a very first Version at
<http://130.255.73.69:5353/tool_query>). The next Step after this is a
World Map with the Positions of all active YaCy-Peers, Geo-Location
based on IP-Address.\

Okay, but i do not know there i can find this kind of informations. As
far as i know this Informations are not available.\
\@Orbiter:\
Any Ideas/Hints for this?\
\
The primary intention of my tool is a DNS-Server and
HTTP-Forwarder/Proxy for the both YaCy-Top-Level-Domains .yacy and
.yacyh , but for fulfilling this Job my Tool must track in detail all
available Peers in the entire YaCy-Peer-to-Peer-Network. If the tracking
works fine there are a lot of informations about the YaCy-Network and i
will show this informations as Statistic.\
