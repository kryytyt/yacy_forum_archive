A minimum of 0 is recommended and means that the page set as crawling
URL, sitemap orfile will be added to the index, but no linked content is
indexed. 2-4 is good for normal indexing. Be careful with the depth,
consider a branching factor of average 20; A ~~prefetch-~~depth of 8
would index 25.600.000.000 pages, maybe this is the whole WWW.
