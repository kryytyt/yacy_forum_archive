> Among the library\'s collection of rare Bibles and Christian
> devotional texts are a series of manuscripts that would have
> scandalized the religious establishment. These texts deal with magic
> \-- from casting charms to conjuring spirits \-- and the Newberry is
> asking for help translating and transcribing them. Digital scans of
> three magical manuscripts are accessible through [Transcribing
> Faith](http://publications.newberry.org/dig/rc-transcribe/index), an
> online portal that functions much like Wikipedia. Anyone with a
> working knowledge of Latin or English is invited to peruse the
> documents and contribute translations, transcriptions, and corrections
> to other users\' work.\[\...\]
>
> The three manuscripts now available online reflect the varied and
> complex ways that magic fit into the broader religious landscape of a
> shifting and modernizing West. The 17th-century *Book of Magical
> Charms* contains instructions on a range of magical practices \--
> \"from speaking with spirits to cheating at dice,\" but also includes
> Latin prayers and litanies that align with mainstream religious
> practices. \[\...\] \"Both protestant and Catholic churches tried very
> hard to make sure that nobody would make a manuscript like this,\" he
> says. \"They didn\'t like magic. They were very suspicious of it. They
> tried to do everything they could to stamp it out. Yet we have this
> manuscript, which is a nice piece of evidence that despite all of that
> effort to make sure people weren\'t doing magic, people still
> continued to do it.\" \[\...\]
>
> Reading through users\' translations has reminded him of some of the
> manuscripts\' more fascinating and bizarre content. The Book of
> Magical Charms, for instance, proffers a rather unusual method for
> alleviating a toothache. \"One of the remedies is finding a dead
> man\'s tooth, which apparently was just available in 17th-century
> England,\" Fletcher said.
