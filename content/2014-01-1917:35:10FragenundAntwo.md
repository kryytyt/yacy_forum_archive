Hi David,\
\
what I can read out of your lines is not a problem of YaCy but a problem
of more supporters.\
As you can see on the commits here:
[https://gitorious.org/yacy/rc1/commits/ \...
0220733f55](https://gitorious.org/yacy/rc1/commits/022c6d3ce1d7c872f837d9de99e3590220733f55){.postlink}
there are just 2-3 main developers working on YaCy.\
Those may have a normal job and can\'t work the whole day on this
project.\
What they can do, they do, when you have a look at the forum and the
wiki.\
To change this situation there exists 2 or more alternatives:\
1. Help YaCy through coding.\
(Download the Source, import the project into Eclipse, identify code
which you can optimize, optimize it and push it to the repository )\
2. Help by donating money.\
(So the core developer do not need to work so much and spend that time
on YaCy or pay developers)\
\
To the english section:\
YaCy is a decentralized search engine. So it would be good if this also
would work for the rest.\
Have a look at: [https://twitter.com/yacy\_search/status/ \...

There has been 1 guy I think who created an english forum you mentioned
but he stops working.\
Its no problem to setup a forum but mainly a legal problem to run
websites in several languages it costs a lot of time and money as you
can see
[viewtopic.php?f=12&t=4872](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=4872){.postlink-local}
in the last post.\
So the easiest way would be if everyone who wants a forum in his
language just setup a forum and this will be linked here -\> problem
solved.\
The main developers also could visit these forums to answer question as
if they were posted here.\
\
To the uptime:\
I dont think the uptime can be used for any statistics about the
stability.\
I have one local peer running which is offline when I shut down my
computer.\
I also have 1 remote peer running and I used it with 2 GB for 1 month
with crawler. After an update (which causes my peer to start running
from 0 again) I tried 600 MB for YaCy without a crawler just DHT and it
works for 3 1/2 days now and it keeps running.\
\
My conclusion:\
Continue to support the community by whether you suggest it to friends
or start contributing code (optimization) or you setup a forum or \...\
I for example recently found a bug in the RSS-Feed and never worked with
Gitorious and the last time I programed with Java was really years ago
\... but I downloaded Eclipse and corrected the code and submitted it to
the repository to try it out. After some days it was checked and brought
into the actual release. I really would contribute more to YaCy but as
long as I do this in my spare time its not possible.\
I suggest you if you run into trouble with your YaCy peer fill in a bug
report or maybe start a thread in this forum.\
YaCy is the only Open Source Search Engine that I know at the moment
which also would work if you just have 1 Computer available and you
would live in a war-zone just like in Syria where maybe the Internet is
shut down at the borders.\
When I look at your post you really want the best for YaCy and this is
good because YaCy needs more people like you so thank you for your
support so far.\
\
PS: I really wonder why no state supports the idea behind YaCy.\
Imagine what yould be done with just 1 Million Euro/USD.\
Europe has no alternative to Google.\
Why is such a project not supported?\
We spend millions for bridges at highways where just 2 people or frogs
crosses the street in 1 whole year.\
But nevertheless the YaCy developers will continue their work on YaCy
and do what they can for it-
