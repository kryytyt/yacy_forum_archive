Just one side question:\
Is it possible to move these 2 directories (HTCACHE and INDEX) to
another location?\
My primary partition holds everything (except swap) and it isn\'t a very
big one.\
On the other hand, I have plenty of room on another partition (which
holds various bits and bytes and it\'s intented mostly for data
storage).\
So, is it possible through Yacy administration to change the location of
these 2 dirs (or if this isn\'t possible, maybe compiling Yacy from
source)?\
