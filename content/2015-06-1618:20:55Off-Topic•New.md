Off-Topic â€¢ New hardware ready to YaCy!
=======================================

Date: 2015-06-16 18:20:55

I\'m in the view of starting a small business and among the requirements
there\'s a\... programmable search engine w/ APIs
![:D](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif "Very Happy")\
\
I previously relied upon Yahoo Boss API while experimenting with YaCy
alongside for testing the grounds for a possible transition. Last month
Yahoo triplicated its API pricing so it\'s become more important to
properly test YaCy capabilities on suitable hardware and decide for a
possible move.\
\
For the sake of the hype, here\'s the hardware

\
These are:\
\

-   Motherboard: dual-CPU 771 Supermicro
-   RAM: 32GB ECC fully-buffered DDR2 (in picture: 24GB by the right
    box, 16GB mounted on MB. Final configuration will have 32GB)
-   CPU: 2 x Intel Xeon L5420, quad-core (yet to arrive)
-   Storage: 4 x 1TB, 7200 rpm (2 SATA, 2 SCSI) \[2 for RAID1, 1 for
    backup, 1 host filesystem\]

\
All will be assembled in a week when the Xeon\'s arrive.\
The existing YaCy virtual machine (currently running on a smaller
server) will run under OpenVZ and will be moved to this server soon as
it\'s assembled.\
\
The target documents count is 100M and the main sources for crawling
will be Amazon, Newegg and Best Buy. The node publicly shares its
indexes and supports the global community network
