I have also never been to a German forum before. How many Germans will
speak English and understand me? 100%? 50%? 10%?\
\
In the U.S., we can learn German in some universities, but unless we
travel overseas, no one could use it! A lot of people learn Spanish, I
had some in high school (9-12th grade level) that I can\'t remember.
Spanish is good for speaking to our Mexican friends to the south. Also,
a popular one here is French - but also not used much. I suppose if we
went to Quebec, Canada it could be used. My brother tried to learn
Mandarin Chinese in uni!! Hard work he said and no use also here for the
most part, so it will be forgotten shortly without any use.\
\
Lots of people here have one or two classes of a foreign language, but
not too many are fluent in another second or third language. It does not
see much use here I think for most people!
