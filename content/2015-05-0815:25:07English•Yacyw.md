Date: 2015-05-08 15:25:07

I do not know what is going on here either my install is borked or
strappyskink.tumblr.com (ADULT WARNING) wont index. it was indexing fine
until march 30th, then something happened\...\
\
I\'ve tried clean installing yacy 1.82 DOES NOT WORK on my machine see
this thread -
[viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5493](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5493){.postlink-local}\
\
Anyway I reinstalled 1.8 from a backup. i then cleared my index. and now
it wont index at all.\
\
if i load from backup and do a re-index it acts somewhat normal but does
not really index new stuff, i want to start from scratch anyway.
