Mitmachen â€¢ Monetizing the YaCy network
=======================================

Date: 2013-12-03 18:26:26

Hi guys,\
\
I like this project very much. I know it brings some very innovative
technology, but it seems to suffer the usual FOSS sicknesses like small
community and limited growth and thus seems to be \"yet another FOSS
project\" only. Have you been thinking about monetizing the network
somehow? If there was a commercial incentive why to join the network,
crawl, help the index grow and serve it to others, there might be some
more potential around. The same way like Bitcoin is taking off - one can
(or at least could) make money Bitcoin in various ways (I am not saying
that the Bitcoin scheme is sustainable though).\
\
I can imagine setting up a commercial YaCy node (public search portal)
that would serve adds and thus could pay for its index storage and
bandwidth\... something in this way. Do you have any ideal on the
commercial potencial?
