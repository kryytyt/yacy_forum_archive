Im waiting on the physical hardware to be delivered from the various
sources so I can start putting together the shipping packages.\
I was waiting on wrapping up the final image until the Login issue was
fixed. I couldn\'t very well shipa product that people wouldn\'t be able
to log into.\
Since I\'m going ahead and including a USB drive with every order,
memory isnt as much of an issue, since I can load 2Gb of swap space into
a swap partition on the USB device, so if on board memory gets lower it
can utilize that.\
\
I was thinking of bundling a shell script for users to upgrade their
YaCy install, but wasnt sure the best way to do this and still retain
any of their logs, data, etc. Do I just save the /DATA dir and import
that into the new folder once the tar.gz is expanded?\
I havent done any testing with trying to update yet.\
I was planning on just providing image updates as needed, which also
allows me to update the kernel, packages, libs, etc. But maybe a way to
update just YaCy is a good idea.
