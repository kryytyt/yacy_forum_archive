  **jwz:**        So the new *Jurassic Park* is set in the present day, two decades after the first movie?
  **kingfish:**   Yes.
  **jwz:**        And the outside world knows about it, this genetic tech isn\'t secret or anything?
  **kingfish:**   Right.
  **jwz:**        So the outside world is full of people with feathers, night vision chibi eyes, esoteric genitalia?
  **kingfish:**   No, not so much.
  **jwz:**        Everyone has a tiny pet dinosaur, at least?
  **kingfish:**   Nope.
  **jwz:**        Miniature giraffes?
  **kingfish:**   Nope.
  **jwz:**        They have developed and marketed a breed of cats who aren\'t dicks?
  **kingfish:**   Not even that.
  **jwz:**        I\'m sorry, without people with feathers, there\'s *no way* I can take this movie seriously.
