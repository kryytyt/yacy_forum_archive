``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
Avoid frequent data type casting (float/long) for rwi score
refactor to using long in URIMetadataNode too (and related call parameters)
As remote rwi score's are not used (since v1.83) skip reading float-score ,
but keep in toString() for communication with older versions.
```
