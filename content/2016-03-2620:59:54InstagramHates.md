All of the \"social media\" services want to [lock you
in](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/03/they-want-to-lock-everyone-into-everything-just-like-everyone-else/).
That\'s been the case for a while. They love their \"walled gardens\"
and they think that so long as they tightly control their users and make
it hard for them to escape, they will rule the world forever.

This was the business model of Compuserve. And AOL. And then a little
thing called The Internet got popular for a minute in the mid 1990s, and
that plan suddenly didn\'t work out so well for those captains of
industry.

But here we go again.

Instagram tries to lock you into their app more than *any* of the other
services. They are hardly even on the Internet at all \-- it\'s more
like a service that exists solely on the cellular data networks.
Instagram is a *dialup BBS.* It is the most locked-in and user-hostile
of the bunch, as I will now express through the medium of a
`<TABLE>` \--

For these reasons, I\'ve mostly just ignored Instagram over the years
\-- my attitude was, \"Oh, you don\'t want to be a part of the Internet?
Welcome to oblivion.\" But it seems like these days, as Twitter begins
circling the drain, the cool kids are ditching Twitter for Instagram.

The thing that makes the Internet useful is *interoperability*. These
companies hate that. The thing that makes the Internet become *more*
useful is the open source notion that there will always be more smart
people who *don\'t* work for your company than that *do*, and some of
those people will find ways to expand on your work in ways you never
anticipated. These companies hate that, too. They\'d rather you have
nothing than that you have something they don\'t own.

Instagram didn\'t even really have a *web site* until 2012! You may not
remember this, but it didn\'t used to be possible to see Instagram
photos from a web browser *at all.*

If that doesn\'t sound insane to you, I can\'t help with your problem.

Now don\'t get me wrong, Facebook is *by far* the worst of the lot. This
is largely due to their size and power, but the fact is that they shit
on their users far more than the others do. This is a quantitative
difference, not qualitative, but it\'s still extreme. As I\'ve said
before, if you work for Facebook, [you should
quit](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/10/if-you-work-for-facebook-quit/);
it\'s the only morally defensible thing for you to do.

But wow, Instagram\'s design decisions are among the most user-hostile
and Internet-hating that I\'ve ever seen.
