> The tool emits a small electrical current that promotes the
> remineralization of the tooth, driving calcium, phosphate, and other
> substances back into the enamel (cavities happen when bacteria break
> down, or demineralize, the enamel with acid). The technique would take
> about as much time and cost about the same or less than a traditional
> filling, and publications describing the technique should be published
> \"in coming months,\" they said.
>
> The technique could put an end the cycle of filling and re-filling,
> said King\'s professor Nigel Pitts. \"When we repair a tooth by
> putting in a filling, that tooth enters a cycle of drilling and
> re-filling as, ultimately, each \'repair\' fails\". But this
> remineralization procedure only needs to be done once, he added.
>
> A Scottish company called Reminova Ltd is trying to commercialize the
> technology and said it could be available in three years if enough
> funding is found. It could take slightly longer in the U.S., though,
> due to the different regulatory environment, the scientists said.
