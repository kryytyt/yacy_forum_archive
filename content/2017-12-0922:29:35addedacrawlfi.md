``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
added a crawl filter based on <div> tag class names
When a crawl is started, a new field to exclude content from scraping is
available. The field can be identified with the class name of div tags.
All text contained in such a div tag where the configured class name(s)
match are not indexed, while the remaining page is indexed.
```
