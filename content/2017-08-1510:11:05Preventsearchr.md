Prevent search result failure on incomplete images information.

Complements the recent modification related to images in commit 7f395ef.

Unfortunately many documents metadata fetched from the freeworld p2p
network have only partial information about embedded images. Without
proper error handling, this made many searches in p2p mode to fail
completely.
