[OMGWTF-Meldung der
Woche](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/opinion/millions-of-men-are-missing-from-the-job-market.html):

> Economists have long struggled to explain why a growing proportion of
> men in the prime of their lives are not employed or looking for work.
> A new study has found that nearly half of these men are on painkillers
> and many are disabled.

Für einen Amerika-Reisenden ist das nicht überraschend mit den
Painkillern. Aber die Größenordnung mal in Zahlen zu hören, das ist ja
schon noch mal was anderes.

> As of last month, 11.4 percent of men between the ages of 25 and 54
> --- or about seven million people --- were not in the labor force,
> which means that they were not employed and were not seeking a job.
