> The following text and pictures illustrate an experiment I carried out
> that involved training laboratory standard rats in trading in the
> Foreign Exchange and Commodity Futures markets, with the result that I
> managed to outperform some of the world\'s leading Human Fund
> managers. \[\...\]

> Each time after listening to a sound, the rat had to choose between
> pressing either a green or a red button, green for \"long\" (if the
> prices were expected to move up), red for \"short\" (if they predicted
> a decline in prices). When they were right they received a small
> amount of food (the good rats became fat very fast); when they took
> the wrong button, they received a minor electric shock. Very soon it
> showed that some rats were doing outstandingly well: they developed a
> good ability to remember the patterns they were listening to; we
> needed them to react to real time data though. \[\...\]

> STEP 3 DEVELOPING A PEDIGREE\
> After extensive training, we wanted to find out if the talent in
> trading might be rooted genetically and crossed the top traders with
> each other. After only 20 days, we had 28 new rats (15 males and 13
> females), and we soon started to train again (even reducing the
> training time). The results were astounding: the second generation of
> top traders had a much better performance than their parents.
