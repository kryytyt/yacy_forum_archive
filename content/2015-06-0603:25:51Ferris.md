> Alan Ruck (Cameron) also concurred, \"But just for fun\", he added,
> \"I used to think why don\'t they wait until Matthew and I are in our
> seventies and do Ferris Bueller Returns and have Cameron be in a
> nursing home. He doesn\'t really need to be there, but he just decided
> his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And
> Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and
> all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, at the end of the movie,
> Cameron dies.\"
