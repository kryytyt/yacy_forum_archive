-   **Howard the Duck**

    I mentioned [six months
    ago](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/07/dark-matter-howard-the-duck/)
    that Howard the Duck is the best thing going on in comics right now,
    and it\'s still true. It\'s just so great! No, I don\'t understand
    how this is possible, either! (Well, I do, it\'s that Chip Zdarsky
    is fucking hilarious, but still.)

    The \"Gwenpool\" backup feature is pretty amazing, too. (Apparently
    there\'s some comic where Gwen Stacy is Spider-Man \-- I dunno, I
    haven\'t read it \-- so the obvious next step is, what the hell, she
    can be [Deadpool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIM1HydF9UA) too.)

    Fun fact: any time I try to type Howard the Duck, it autocorrects to
    Howard the Fuck because [years
    ago](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/04/pro-tip-ducking-autocorrect/)
    I set \"Fuck\" as the completion for \"Duck\", having noticed that I
    never, ever type \"ducking\" but type \"fucking\" a lot. Fucking
    thanks, Howard.

-   **Phonogram: The Immaterial Girl**

    There\'s a new *Phonogram!* It\'s basically about the *Take On Me*
    video! And the ghost of The Long Blondes! Aaaaahhhhh it\'s so great!
    And after they said [it was impossible to do
    another](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2010/03/phonogram-and-the-tragic-state-of-comics/).
    *\"The bargain was for half of a girl\'s personality. You may see a
    loophole.\"*

-   **Harley Quinn Power Girl**

    Ok, this is going to be hard to believe, but the Harley Quinn Power
    Girl miniseries is actually pretty funny. The backstory is that
    Power Girl got bonked on the head and has slight amnesia, so Harley
    took the opportunity to tell her that she had *always* been her
    sidekick. Hijinks ensue.

    Some caveats: 1) It\'s not as funny as the 2010 Power Girl series,
    where she spends so much time punching out dinosaurs that it might
    as well be an [Atomic Robo](http://www.atomic-robo.com/) comic \--
    seriously, *that* series was great; and 2) I absolutely *hate* the
    way Harley Quinn is drawn (there is only One True Harley Quinn and
    that\'s the Paul Dini version from *Batman The Animated Series*.
    Likewise, the One True Joker is Mark Hamill and I\'ll fight anyone
    who says different). BUT: This happened, ok:

    Yeah, that\'s Sean Connery as Zardoz. Then at some point they get
    really high and hallucinate for no reason that advances the plot
    (such as it is) in any way. I totally respect that.

-   **Sex Criminals**

    A couple of dorks have the superpower that when they have orgasms,
    they can stop time. Bank robberies ensue. It\'s 20% filthy and 80%
    cringeworthy, in a very
    [*Mortified*](https://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2016/02-12a.html)
    kind of way. And there\'s some kind of Sailor Moon Spunk Ghost.
    (Speaking of which, you should also be reading
    [Oglaf](http://www.oglaf.com/).) Don\'t skip the letters columns,
    where people write in with childhood tales of the first time they
    came across moldy piles of porn in the woods.

-   **Saga**

    Wow, what happened? It\'s still ok, but I\'m really kind of bored by
    Saga right now. It feels like everyone in it has been just bumbling
    around waiting for something to happen for a year.

-   **The Wicked and The Divine**

    Oh my god this is boring. It\'s by Gillen and McKelvie, who also do
    Phonogram, so I expected to love this but it is just so\... Teen
    Paranormal Romance. I give literally zero shits about any of the
    characters, or the mythology, or who killed who, or whether any of
    them survive. Cartoon Annie Lennox was ok, but got killed off pretty
    much right out of the gate.

-   **Bitch Planet**

    It sounded like a decent concept \-- *The Handmaid\'s Tale* as 70s
    women-in-prison exploitation movie, in spaaaaace \-- but again, file
    it under no shits given for any character or plot elements. I\'ve
    read more compelling ranty twitter accounts and you probably have
    too.
