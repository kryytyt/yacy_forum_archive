Der CVS-Checkin des Tages [kommt von
OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libssl/ssl/Makefile?rev=1.29;content-type=text%2Fx-cvsweb-markup).

    Log message:
    Disable Segglemann's RFC520 hearbeat.I am completely blown away that the same IETF that cannot efficiently
    allocate needed protocol, service numbers, or other such things when
    they are needed, can so quickly and easily rubber stamp the addition
    of a 64K Covert Channel in a critical protocol.  The organization
    should look at itself very carefully, find out how this this happened,
    and everyone who allowed this to happen on their watch should be
    evicted from the decision making process.  IETF, I don't trust you.
