YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: Commit 136e8f6 and 1-char queries
==================================================================

Thanks for pointing out that this behavior is not all due to commit
136e8f6, as the indexer itself already stripes 1-char elements, too.
Still, the overall behavior is that Yacy yields irrelevant results for
those queries where a 1-char element is indispensable to the meaning of
the query.\
Whoever would expect to receive relevant results by searching for
queries like those reported below would not get relevant results.\
\
Examples:\

-   Y chromosome
-   P S waves
-   World War 2
-   9 11
-   Pentium 4
-   OS X
-   X factor
-   The incredibles 4
