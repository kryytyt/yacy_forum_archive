However, we\'ve been testing other RPi builds using various bases. We
are noticing significant performance gains using a hard float with the
newer JDK7u51. 7u60 is in early access right now, once its released
we\'ll check it out. And I mean [significant]{style="font-weight: bold"}
gains, I\'d guess a factor of three to four times more responsive.\
\
So dont both testing that image, I\'m going to try to make a new image
early next week. I\'ll email you once that\'s done.
