YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Java Web Start launch alternative
==============================================================

Date: 2016-02-26 10:44:12

Hello, I would personally find it great to have a Java Web Start link
(JNLP) on yacy.net website as an alternative to OS dependent installers
(here is a good example on JOSM project website :
<http://josm.openstreetmap.de/>)\
I think it could be helpful for some newcomers who don\'t want to
\"install\" something but want to try a local YaCy peer, and may be
afraid by github and ant compile.\
At least a link to <http://latest.yacy.net:81/update/> last stable
release would be a good thing.\
But a Java Web Start link is easier (only one click needed) and truly
cross-platform.\
\
First step to make it possible is to produce a runnable jar. Not a big
deal with an ant task, but some other modifications are likely to be
needed : for example, at first startup yacy assume default config files
are in a local \'defaults\' directory rather than in classpath. I have
already started to experiment, but as more work is needed, I am
wondering what you think of this idea\... Have you already tried? Would
you support this and eventually add an third deployment link on yacy.net
website?
