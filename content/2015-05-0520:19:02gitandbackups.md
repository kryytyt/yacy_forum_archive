git and backups
===============

![](http://www.jwz.org/images/0blld7h.jpg)Dear Lazyweb, how can I tune
git to make it be more amenable to rsync-based backups?

I do my backups with [rsync from the root
directory](http://www.jwz.org/doc/backups.html), as is right and proper.
One of my machines has a dozen git repositories scattered around its
file system in various places. This machine\'s backup target is at the
other end of a not-fast connection.

And, git\'s data model seems to be \"I\'m going to continuously make
100% changes to multiple 50+ MB files, to ensure that there\'s nothing
incremental about your incremental backups.\"

Is there any way to tune git\'s file usage to be less egregious? Do
\"git gc\" and \"git repack\" make this worse, or better?

You\'re about to suggest that I not back up my git repositories, but
just do a dozen different git checkouts on the backup-target machine
instead. No. Let\'s just leave it at \"no\" so that I don\'t have to
explain the several different ways in which that suggestion is stupid.

Kinda missing CVS right now.
