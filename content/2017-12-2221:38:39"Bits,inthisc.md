is now emulating LCD handheld games, which is weird and kind of amazing.
The sort of games that had little light-up chunks of the \"moving\"
portions on top of a printed background, like an old digital watch.
Here\'s a thread describing the extraction process:

> Multiple photos are taken of the exposed die, then stitched together.

He\'s looking for
[donations](https://twitter.com/TheMogMiner/status/943943662525919232)
to help him buy a big auction of old handhelds to de-cap and extract.

I understand that MAME can also emulate Pong now, and I\'m not even
really sure what that means, because Pong was arguably *not a computer*.
It didn\'t have \"code\". It didn\'t have a CPU. It was
[wire-wrapped](http://www.pong-story.com/odymodul.htm) out of discrete
analog components: a state machine and signal generator made out of
relays as big as your thumbnail.
