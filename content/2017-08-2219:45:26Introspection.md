> Unceremoniously lifting the surgical cloth that covers the heart,
> Roberts describes what he sees. The history of the heart is there,
> incontrovertibly embedded in the organ. Most are cocooned in hard
> yellow fat. \[\...\]
>
> Murtha awoke in an intensive care unit, with a new heart bounding in
> his chest. His old heart went first to the pathology lab for an
> autopsy. At that point, Roberts claims, \"99.5 percent of hospitals
> throw the hearts away. They just don\'t have the space to keep them.\"
> Baylor is different, however. Their lab contains thousands of hearts
> in permanent storage, making it one of the most extensive cardiac
> research facilities in the world. The availability of these organs
> creates a unique opportunity for a program like Heart-to-Heart.

> Hendrix had expected to see something \"black and shriveled, probably
> three times the normal size, and just jello-like.\"
>
> Bell had expected a big red ideograph, \"like when you open a
> Valentine\'s card.\"
>
> \"It wasn\'t like that at all though,\" he continued. \"What it
> reminded me of, was a piece of roast beef.\"
