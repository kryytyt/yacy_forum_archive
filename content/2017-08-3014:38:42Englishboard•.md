English board â€¢ \[MetaGer\] Source Code for Mobile
==================================================

Date: 2017-08-30 14:38:42

Was curious if it were possible to obtain the complete source code for
the Android mobile application? I searched a bit and was unable to find
and am unsure if it is even available.\
\
The applications are based upon already freely available upstream
code-bases, but the down-stream modifications made for MetaGer
integration do not appear to be readily available to end users (at least
not within [the GitLab
instance](https://gitlab.metager3.de/open-source){.postlink}). The
MetaGer [About page](https://metager.de/about){.postlink} expresses a
strong commitment to \"open source\", yet the developers of the mobile
applications appear to not extend the same [software
freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html){.postlink} to
users of their software.\
\
Binaries distributed through Google Play are subject and vulnerable to
such attacks as NSA \"[IRRITANT
HORN](https://theintercept.com/2015/05/21/nsa-five-eyes-google-samsung-app-stores-spyware/){.postlink}\",
NSA/Google surveillance, among others; while precompiled binaries
distributed on the [MetaGer apps](https://metager.de/app){.postlink}
page leave users vulnerable to attacks against\--or even conducted
by\--the developers, or compromised MetaGer Web-servers. Individuals
should be free to audit the code base, and to compile binaries on their
own trusted machines without being reliant upon third parties.\
\
I reiterate,\
If source code is available: where may one obtain it?\
If it is not available: please consider extending to users the same
freedoms enjoyed by the developer. Additionally, making source code
available under a free software license makes it possible to build and
package binaries for the [F-Droid
repository](https://f-droid.org/){.postlink} of Free and open-source
Android software.
