SXSW 2015 torrent \#1 is up
===========================

Date: 2015-02-18 22:18:14

[844 files - 5.41 GB](http://www.sxswtorrent.com/2015).

I\'m not going to SXSW this year for the reasons I outlined in my [SXSW
RIP post](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/03/sxsw-rip/). TL/DR: much worse
curation, worse scheduling and massive price increase means it\'s not
worth my effort and time.

As such, I\'m not sure I\'m even going to bother doing the deathmarch
through this pile of MP3s this year, since I expect that rather than
finding new artists from all over the world (like it used to be) I\'m
instead going to find a bunch of established, signed artists from LA who
already have soundtrack and TV commercial deals (like last year).

Interestingly, the creators of the torrent found it less difficult to
create this year, because unlike last year, SXSW is back to posting MP3s
instead of hosting everything on Soundcloud, wrapped in tasty DRM for
your protection and convenience.

Why might that be? Might it be because someone stopped paying? Might it
be because this year, Soundcloud is no longer on the \"Super Sponsors\"
list on their front page? Hmmm?

If you\'re going, you might find my [SXSW
Scraper](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/03/sxsw-scraper-3/) useful, though
I haven\'t tried it against the 2015 web site. It will probably require
patching.
