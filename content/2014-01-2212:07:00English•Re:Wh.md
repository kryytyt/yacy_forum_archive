alright, your question is valid: a new user cannot start an english
posting because there is no space for that. Therefore I just created
this new forum section for english postings. I moved you posting here,
therefore it becomes the first posting in this new forum.\
\
your Questions:\
\
1) - here
![:D](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif "Very Happy")\
2) I believe it is possible to set a language when you subscribe to the
forum. The naviagtion should then be in english, but I never tried\...
The forum rules are in german, yes, therefore I started this forum
section. We do not have the variety of discussion topics here, so there
is also not a variety of forum rules in english.\
3) on windows, I believe you must use the backslash as separator, like
\"file://D:\\\" but it may be the case that you must mask every
backslash with another one because it is treated as escape character,
like \"file://D:\\\\\".
