[The Last Days Of
20A0:](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2018/02/28/the-last-days-of-20a0/)

> It\'s happening again.
>
> You can feel it, can\'t you? The relentless immediacy of crisis over
> crisis, the yawning void tne endless emergency is stretched taut to
> obscure. The soul-bending psychological trauma; even moments of
> optimism seem unfairly compressed, hyperdense self-referential memetic
> shards landing like cartoon anvils and sublimated into vapor by the
> meteoric heat of the Next Thing. The spiritual torniquet of the
> perpetually immediate present twisting tighter, fractions of degrees
> at a time.
>
> You can hear fragments of the past that remain, the warning signs
> engineered to survive their own absence singing the speed, the mass of
> this oncoming train to anyone foolish or optimistic enough (and is
> there a difference, at this remove?) to put an ear to the tracks.
> It\'s happening again; here we are in the moments before the moment,
> and it can\'t be an accident that those who seem most adept in this
> psychosocial twilight, deftly navigating unmoored in cold storms of
> this howling psychic gyre are people who\'ve lost their anchors or
> thrown them overboard by choice in the name of some dark mirrored
> vision of liberty or mere expediency, in the long calm of the before.
> They\'re just one more set of symptoms now, signs of symbols nested in
> symbols whose ultimate referents are burned to ash beneath them.
>
> It is happening again.
