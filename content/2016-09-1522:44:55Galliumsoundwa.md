> The usage of the Cymatic Gallium instead of the water pools was a
> creative push to create something novel by utilizing a material that
> had rarely been affected by audio-driven vibrations before. Gallium is
> special its low melting point of roughly 85 degrees F, allowing it to
> melt at body temperatures. The setup was to allow the liquid metal to
> vibrate across a black acrylic plane, swirling in recessed typographic
> pools that collectively made up the construct of the Thump logo.
>
> To create the organic ripples that affected the Gallium, the team
> hooked up a series of Synthesizers and cultivated a series of custom
> built sine-wave frequencies from a large speaker that caused the metal
> troughs resting on it to ripple and form detailed sound wave patterns.
> These sounds were then synchronized with the camera\'s frame-rate,
> thus achieving the time frozen formation look, and also were used in
> the final sound design and mix so the visual feedback felt real and
> authentic.
