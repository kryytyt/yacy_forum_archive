Yes, port 9090 is opened\... System status shows:\

Code: 
:   `Address    Host: []:9090    Public Address: http://89.72.247.126:49158    YaCy Address: http://krzyszp-odroid.yacy `

\
As you can see \"Public address\" shows 49158 and every Yacy restart
increase by 1\...\
I have no idea why. If you go to my IP address with 9090 port you can
see search portal, but all communication to other peer go through 49158
port which is obviously wrong\...
