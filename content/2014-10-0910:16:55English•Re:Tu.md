\@Orbiter: Thanks a lot, I somehow missed this YouTube channel. I hope
I\'ll be able to contribute when I\'ll find my way around YaCy and
discover solutions for my questions in the previous topic.

Really nice would be if somebody experienced could write eng Wiki
sections \"The basics\" and especially \"For beginners\". That could
help a lot of people.\
BTW, Orbiter, is there any change that I saw you as speaker on 2012
Campus Party in Berlin? I\'ve checked your Twitter and your photo looks
familiar.
