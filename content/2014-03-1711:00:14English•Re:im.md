Thank you for your answer. I did already this. So I uninstalled
completely yacy, removed the remaing files found with «locate yacy». I
made sure that only openjdk-6 is installed, and I reinstalld yacy.\
In the configuration I changed the yacy peer name, the password and
leaved the other parameters by deffault.\
\
In the yacy interface, I have still the same messaqe «The site
<http://localhost:8090> asks for an username and a password. The site
indicates : « YaCy-AdminUI ». I tried YaCy-AdminUI as user with the only
password it knows, same message. I tried other users as my own
identifier, as root, as yacy peer name, and i got always the same
message. I do not understand, it should be very simple, but it does not
work.\
\
Have you other ideas ?
