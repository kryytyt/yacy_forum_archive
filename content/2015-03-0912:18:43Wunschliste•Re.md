Thank you very kindly for the good news.\
\
Regarding the \'harvest,\' due to the use of YaCy for our project, we
need to collect the maximum number of answers possible.\
We know good sources frequently have many thousands of answers that can
be generated in a local search on their sites,\
\
You started to explain:\

\
\
How and what/where do we adapt YaCy\'s approach to these OpeanSearch
sources to harvest the most that each source has in its databases,
please?\
It seems we are getting less than we would expect from some big
sources.\
Many thanks
