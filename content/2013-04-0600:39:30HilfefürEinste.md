The default\* YaCy 32 bit install test is complete. Approximately 7 days
after starting the node, the memory was \"full\" as the graph below
shows. Performing a single search for \"freedom\" crashed the web
interface within a minute or two, and it was no longer responsive. The
java task is still running since I performed these tests yesterday, but
the web interface is inaccessible. I\'m not sure if the process is doing
anything useful, the logs are just filling up with:\
\

These messages appear repetitively in the log file since yesterday.\

Since this is the behavior of the default install, what can be done to
prevent the memory from filling but still be able to search in
freeworld? If I turn off DHT-In, I cannot search freeworld (remote
search) any longer, is this correct? Is there any way to keep YaCy from
outgrowing a small memory footprint? How do you keep it running on the
Raspberry Pi continuously, for instance? My \"low memory\" 32 bit test
only worked for a week with only passive use (no local searching or
proxy)..?
