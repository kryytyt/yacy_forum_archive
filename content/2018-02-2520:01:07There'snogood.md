There\'s no good argument against letting 16-year-olds vote, but there are plenty of good arguments for it.

who are 16 and 17 are as qualified to vote as anyone in the 80s or

[If you think young people should vote, I suppose you don\'t have a
problem with trying young people as adults in

I see from my previouslies that 14 years ago there was a [proposed
California
amendment](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200320040SB1606)
to [give 14 year olds \"half a
vote\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20040312080854/http%3A//www.pressdemocrat.com/local/vote04/state/09teenvote.html).
I never heard anything about it again because [it died in
committee](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/03-04/bill/sen/sb_1601-1650/sb_1606_bill_20041130_history.html)
and never came to a vote or debate.

Those kids would be 28 by now.
