Fragen und Antworten â€¢ Firewall port 8090 - opening
===================================================

Date: 2013-08-06 15:22:06

I have for some time ago installed YaCy on my computer. And afterwards
opened the firewall port 8090, which was also reported succesfull.\
Never the less, on the startpage I steadily get the message, that other
peers can not reach my peer.\
I am running the Linux distribution openSUSE 12.1 and the browser
Firefox.\
I am attached via cable to an external internet distributor and runs a
local wireless network at home.\
What could be done? - Please, will someone help me!\
Yours sincerely - Ole Rohde.
