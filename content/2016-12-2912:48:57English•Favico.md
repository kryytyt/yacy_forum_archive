English â€¢ Favicons not showing in allip mode
============================================

Date: 2016-12-29 12:48:57

I have the latest version of Yacy running on Ubuntu VPSs. I noticed the
icons weren\'t showing in search results. I had searched the net for a
solution and couldn\'t find any. By chance I noticed the icons show when
Yacy functions as in webportal network type. Meanwhile in network type
allip, it doesn\'t.\
\
Does anyone know what I need to do to sort this?
