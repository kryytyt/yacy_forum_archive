English â€¢ Re: Install Yacy in more than on servers
==================================================

Date: 2015-04-11 13:04:35

to run several YaCy servers on the same domain you just need to
configure different ports for them.\
Either change the port attribute in default/yacy.init before you start
YaCy the first time or change the port in the basic configuration page
after the start.\
\
But you don\'t need several YaCy instances if you want to start several
crawls. Just start several Crawls on the same YaCy instance, they will
run concurrently.
