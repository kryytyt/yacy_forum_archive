> In June, the Fourth Circuit ruled in favor of an employee who objected
> to having his hand scanned because he said it would brand him with the
> Mark of the Beast. The EEOC sued on the employee\'s behalf, saying he
> was entitled to a reasonable accommodation for his belief that the
> scanning would mark him as a follower of the Antichrist. The employer
> refused to let him just enter his ID number on a keypad (which
> apparently doesn\'t present the same concern), and actually gave him a
> letter saying that under its interpretation of Scripture, it would be
> okay if he scanned his left hand and not his right. He quit instead.
> The Fourth Circuit said there was no dispute the employee\'s belief
> was sincere, and no reason not to accommodate it.
