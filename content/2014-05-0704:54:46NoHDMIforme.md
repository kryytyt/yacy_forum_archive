No HDMI for me
==============

And now suddenly my Mac has lost the ability to puke HDMI out of the
Mini DisplayPort adapter. But if I plug an HDMI-to-DVI adapter into the
Mini DisplayPort adapter, it works. When I plug the monitor in through
HDMI, I don\'t even see a \"monitor changed\" message in system.log, but
I do with DVI. I also tried a new Mini DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter;
same.

Given the [other video
bullshit](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/04/video-stuttering-2/) I\'ve
been dealing with, does this suggest my video card is dying?

The Mac is a Mid-2010 27\" iMac11,3, and the current line of iMacs
aren\'t all [that
different](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/imac-aluminum-faq/differences-between-imac-aluminum-mid-2011-mid-2010-models.html),
having not been updated since mid-2011, so I was hoping to put off
upgrading it until they got around to releasing a new batch. Maybe
that\'s no longer an option.

(That would also mean either downgrading from a 4TB drive to a 3TB
drive, or cracking open a brand new iMac, since Apple won\'t sell you
one with a 4TB drive in it.)

Arrrgh.
