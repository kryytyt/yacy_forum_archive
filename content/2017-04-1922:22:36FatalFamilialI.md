this one away for your late-night hypochondria: it\'s got a lovely *Fall
of the House of Usher* vibe to it.

[The average survival time for patients diagnosed with FFI after the
onset of symptoms is 18
months.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_familial_insomnia)

> The disease has four stages:
>
> 1.  The person has increasing insomnia, resulting in panic attacks,
>     paranoia, and phobias. This stage lasts for about four months.
> 2.  Hallucinations and panic attacks become noticeable, continuing for
>     about five months.
> 3.  Complete inability to sleep is followed by rapid loss of weight.
>     This lasts for about three months.
> 4.  Dementia, during which the patient becomes unresponsive or mute
>     over the course of six months. This is the final progression of
>     the disease, after which death follows.
>
> Other symptoms include profuse sweating, pinpoint pupils, the sudden
> entrance into menopause for women and impotence for men, neck
> stiffness, and elevation of blood pressure and heart rate.
> Constipation is common as well. As the disease progresses, the patient
> will become stuck in a state of pre-sleep limbo, or hypnagogia, which
> is the state just before sleep in healthy individuals. During these
> stages, it is common for patients to repeatedly move their limbs as if
> dreaming.

[The Tragic Fate Of The People Who Stop
Sleeping:](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160118-the-tragic-fate-of-the-people-who-stop-sleeping)

> Silvano eventually referred himself to the University of Bologna\'s
> sleep unit for further study, but he was under no illusions about the
> course of the disease. \"He said, \'I\'ll stop sleeping, and within
> eight or nine months, I\'ll be dead,\'\" one of his doctors, Pietro
> Cortelli, told me in a phone interview.
>
> \"I said \'how can you be sure?\' He then drew me his genealogical
> tree from the 18th Century, all by heart.\" In each generation,
> Silvano could name family members who had succumbed to the same fate.

> Whereas Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease leaves the surface of the brain
> looking like Swiss cheese, Silvano\'s condition seems to target parts
> of the thalamus, at the very centre of the skull. Normally the size
> and shape of a walnut, the thalamus in Silvano\'s brain appeared to
> have been riddled with boring worms. \[\...\]
>
> Daniel was determined to try as many potential treatments as possible,
> ranging from vitamin supplements and exercise to improve his general
> fitness to anaesthetics such as ketamine and nitrous oxide, and sleep
> medicines like diazepam \-- anything that would give him a few winks
> of sleep, even for as short as 15 minutes at a time. He even bought a
> sensory deprivation tank, having found that even under an anaesthetic,
> his fragile slumbers could be interrupted by the slightest sound or
> movement.
>
> Floating in the egg-shaped cocoon while bathed in warm salt water, he
> found the rest that had proven so elusive, enjoying a blissful
> four-and-a half hours of solid sleep. Once he awoke, however, he had
> to face terrifying hallucinations \-- including a strange uncertainty
> as to whether he was alive or dead.
