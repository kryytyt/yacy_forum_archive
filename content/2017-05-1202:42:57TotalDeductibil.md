> SANFORD, FL \-- A newly formed health insurance company owned by a
> group of devoted Calvinists announced that they will not cover any
> health condition, since every condition of humankind was pre-existing
> and established by sovereign God before the foundation of time.
>
> The company, Total Deductibility, states clearly in its bylaws that
> \"pre-existing conditions may not be covered, which include every
> possible ailment and so-called \'accident,\' all of which God foreknew
> and predestined to occur prior to the existence of the client\'s
> policy, and time itself.\" The firm was thrilled when the new GOP
> health care law, which drops the requirement to cover some
> pre-existing conditions, passed the House, according to a company
> spokesperson.
>
> \"We can now reject every single claim, based on its pre-existing
> status,\" she told reporters. \"Whether or not the client was aware of
> the condition has no bearing; God sovereignly pre-arranged every
> condition before the dawn of the universe, and therefore we must
> refuse all claims based on this truth.\"
