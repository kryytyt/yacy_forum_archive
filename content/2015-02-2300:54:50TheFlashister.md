The Flash is terrible
=====================

![](http://www.jwz.org/images/flash_mad_04.jpg)Ok, *The Flash* is
terrible, it\'s stupid, it\'s poorly written and I have no sympathy for
any of the characters, BUT, the stupidest possible thing about it is
that we\'re to believe that these three pinheads \-- who barely seem
like they could manage to get their algebra homework turned in on time
\-- are somehow managing to run a solitary-confinement supermax prison
all on their own in the basement of their office building.

Even aside from the fact that that\'s so creepy and torture-y that even
*Batman* would probably say, *\"Dude, that\'s pretty fucked up right
there,\"* how are we to believe that they\'re pulling this off?

Who is feeding those people? Who is emptying the shit-buckets? (Because
I\'m pretty sure the conveniently prison-like cells inside their magic
\"particle accelerator\" don\'t have toilets.)

One of their prisoners turns into *poison gas*. What does the\... uh\...
precipitate\... of that even *look* like?

God I hate this show.
