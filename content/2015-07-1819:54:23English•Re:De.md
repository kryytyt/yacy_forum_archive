To keep things linked and ordered,\
I also reported the request on Mantis, here:
<http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=595>\
\
As probably this forum is the most active and visited among the two,
I\'ll also drop here a few examples of CMS images which should be
demoted from search results for being irrelevant and computably too
recurrent.
