As the hosting of a general search engine has not the intention to do
something illegal this should be ok. Moreover the content crawling is
fully automatic and can not be controlled for each document to be
illegal or not. When someone asks you for removal of a specific site out
of your index due to some laws, you can use the blacklist feature of
YaCy. This should be a suitable method to comply with the law, at least
in Germany. But first, someone would have to ask for it.
