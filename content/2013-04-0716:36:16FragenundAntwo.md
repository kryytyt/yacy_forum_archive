Fragen und Antworten â€¢ Chrooted yacy
====================================

Date: 2013-04-07 16:36:16

Hello\
\
I would like to try yacy at my server, but I can only do it in chroot\
\
I have experience installing pretty hard things in chroot but not
something based on java, no. That seems to be challenging. Had anyone
succeeded in installing yacy in chroot, please, or I would better drop
this idea altogether from the very beginning?\
\
Also, would there be any difficulties if I use a bit outdated system,
say, debian lenny?\
\
Thanks
