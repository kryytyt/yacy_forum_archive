\@q5sys whats the current status? YaCyPi got fundet and I believe you
are working on the deployment.\
Do you want to show here your latest image for testing?\
Here are some hints about the current status:\
\
- the password and account problem was fixed, should work hopefully\...\
- I added some rules to prevent execution of high-peformance tasks like
postprocessing if memory is less or below 600MB, therefore that should
never start on a RPi\
- there had been another settings to controll execution of specific
tasks like index distribution when local load is too high. You may want
to change these default settings (see all fields in yacy.init with
\'loadprereq\')\
- I worked hard to reduce memory usage and to fix memory leaks\
- I made some performance enhancements.\
\
When you deploy the RPi you should add a \'reset\' script which an be
used to remove the current YaCy instalation and replace it either with
the YaCy version that you deployed or the latest version that you
provide for updates, if you want to. I would think that this is like a
good support to peope wo get a delivery and it would extend the livespan
of such YaCyPi devices.
