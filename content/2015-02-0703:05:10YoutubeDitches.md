> A year ago, the largest video site on the net ditching Flash would
> have been a blow for Internet freedom. Today, it\'s a bitter reminder
> of how the three big commercial browser vendors \-- Apple, Microsoft
> and Google \-- Netflix, the BBC, and the World Wide Web Consortium
> sold the whole Internet down the river. \[\...\]
>
> Now, you can access all of Youtube videos without having to use
> Adobe\'s proprietary software, so long as your browser supports the
> W3C\'s version of Adobe\'s proprietary software. If you\'re using
> Firefox, you can access all of Youtube\'s videos without Flash, except
> that in some cases, you\'ll need their version of the W3C-standardized
> \"Encrypted Media Extension\" \-- which requires that you use
> proprietary software. From Adobe.
