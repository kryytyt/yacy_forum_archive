> In the front, the display has a basin comparable to an acquarium in
> which Ferro Fluid can move freely. Behind the scenes powerful
> electromagnets enable Ferollic to influence the fluid\'s shape, to
> pick it up and move it around. Ferrolic does not produce light and is
> 100% silent since it does not contain mechanically moving elements.
> Its unique dynamics are the visual result of the black fluid
> continiously finding balance between gravity, magnetic fields and its
> own van de Waals forces.
