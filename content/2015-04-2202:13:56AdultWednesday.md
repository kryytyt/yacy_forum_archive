> Hi everyone! Thank you for the outpouring of support and concern about
> the disappearance of Adult Wednesday Addams from the internet. As many
> of you have seen, the Tee & Charles Addams Foundation flagged the show
> and, for now, it is off of YouTube. I am working actively on coming to
> a resolution and will not let Wednesday be caged in internet
> purgatory. I appreciate your patience and support while\... I sort
> this issue out!
>
> Obviously, this is very upsetting that the videos aren\'t online.
> Wednesday means so much to me as I know she does to you. Thank you for
> all of your enthusiasm. Your support every step of the way has meant
> the world to me.
>
> UPDATE: At this point, the Tee & Charles Addams Foundation cannot do
> anything to change the status of this issue, so sending messages and
> donations will not remedy the situation. If there is anything that can
> be done in support of the series, I will let you know. Thank you again
> for everything!

Her now-mostly-empty Youtube channel is
[here](https://www.youtube.com/user/heymelissahunter/videos). If you
haven\'t seen all 13 episodes of this hilarious series, it\'s still easy
for you to do so: **[oh look,
torrents](https://kickass.to/usearch/adult%20wednesday%20addams/)**.
That doesn\'t give her the ad money, though.
