YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: YaCy Release 1.90

One thing is missing in this release: a framework App for Mac. I was not
able to get this together. The old wrapper cannot be used since Oracle
changed something and the Mac OS starts now java in a different way.\
\
Can somebody try to find out how to create a new Mac App wrapper?\
Please help and post a solution here!
