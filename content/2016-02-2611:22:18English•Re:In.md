English â€¢ Re: Indexing local file:/// without going upwards

maybe the \'restrict to subpath\' does not work correctly because it
expects a domain which is not there with file paths.\
It should work when \'use filter\' is set to a self-defined filter, like
\"file:///home/user/data.\*\" (I did not try that yet.. but if that does
not work it is definitely a bug)
