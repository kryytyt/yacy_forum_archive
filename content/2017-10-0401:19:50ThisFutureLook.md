> There is a whole class of slaves. It is illegal for them to escape
> slavery. The cops are supposed to murder the slaves if they escape,
> because there is a risk that they will start to think they\'re people.
> But the cops know that the slaves are not people, so it\'s okay to
> murder them. The greatest danger, the thing the cops are supposed to
> prevent, is that the slaves will try to assimilate into the society
> that relies on their labor.
>
> Assimilation is designed to be impossible. There are tests. Impossible
> tests with impossible questions and impossible answers. The tests
> measure empathy. It is not about having enough empathy, but about
> having empathy for the correct things. If you do not have enough
> empathy for the correct things, you will be murdered by a cop who does
> have empathy for the correct things. \[\...\]
>
> The first such murder we witness is that of a woman who escaped
> slavery and came to Earth. She has found herself a job. It\'s a
> degrading job, a job that even the hard-boiled, world-weary Deckard
> flinches away from watching. But it\'s a job. She is participating in
> society. She is working. She\'s doing the things that she has to do in
> order to be a part of the world that she risked everything to reach.
>
> Deckard comes to her workplace. He finds her there, and he knows what
> she is, and she runs away from him because she knows what cops do to
> women like her. He chases her through the street and corners her. He
> aims his gun at her through a crowd of people. He squints. He takes a
> second too long to decide whether to shoot. She runs again.
>
> (Nobody tells you about that part, when you tell them you\'re about to
> watch *Blade Runner* for the first time. They tell you about all the
> different versions, and they tell you about the ambiguity of the
> ending, and they tell you about the fact that all the effects are
> practical effects. But nobody tells you about the part where a cop
> aims a loaded firearm into a crowd of people and tries to decide
> whether it\'s worth risking their lives in order to murder an escaped
> slave.)
