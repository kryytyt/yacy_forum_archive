YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Using WARC as import option & YaCy2 architecture
=============================================================================

In the conext of a [YaCy re-design towards a
YaCy2](https://twitter.com/yacy_search/status/644182736446586880){.postlink}
I plan to rip YaCy apart into stand-alone modules, make room for funded
(and commercially usable) plug-in parts and then pack the resulting
modules again together to different appliances. This could lead to a
\'new\' YaCy which is compatible to the old network but is composed by
the new modules. A target is also to create professional appliance
packages which can consist of parts which are not applicable for p2p
search but necessary for customers.\

One of the tasks to create that architecture is the identification of
standards which the modules of YaCy2 should support. I identified that
WARC is really amazing and important and would fit into the YaCys user
demand to collect large amounts of web data. WARC is the file standard
of the internet archive <http://archive.org>\
There are a lot of interesting applications available to create and
process WARC:\
\

-   WARC can be created by wget and it\'s really simple:\

    Code: 
    :   `wget -r --warc-file=yacy.net.warc http://yacy.net`

    .. creates a full archive of yacy.net
-   WARC can be created using <http://webrecorder.io> (this is similar
    to the YaCy proxy idea: record everything which you browse) .. this
    will also be open source soon!
-   There is an archive software for WARC which is \'like archive.org\',
    so its a DIY archive.org software:
    <https://github.com/ikreymer/pywb> (check out the other tools of
    <https://github.com/ikreymer> .. its mostly about WARC)
-   there is a java library available to parse WARC files; that could be
    integrated in YaCy to feed it\'s parser:
    <https://sbforge.org/display/JWAT/Usage>
-   I tried and liked a lot the webarchiveplayer
    <https://github.com/ikreymer/webarchiveplayer> - this starts a web
    server and within your browser you get all the content from a
    specific WARC file served (unfortunately this starts on our default
    port 8090 so you might have to stop YaCy to try that
    ![:(](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif "Sad")
    .. or change the port)

\
I also like to idea that in a YaCy2 architecture we should be able to
share on two levels: additionally to p2p index sharing we could do a
WARC sharing as well. I consider to add a bittorrent tracker for that
together with a WARC archive management to the list of modules which
could be glued together to YaCy2.\
\
What do you think? Please try the wget command above and maybe start to
collect WARC archives which we can share to bootstrap a huge YaCy2 index
when software modules are ready!
