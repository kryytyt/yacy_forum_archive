Thank you very kindly for the detailed analysis, discussion & proposed
testing routines.\
I have to look at how to do all of that\...whew\...not easy.\
\
Alternatively, but perennially,\...\
Our \#1 problem ultimately is in taking the DATA folder and reinstalling
elsewhere.\
It is quite large, now.\
\
But the worst part is huge risk of\
both\
1) losing the feeding trail of URLs & particularly RSS links that are
programmed for daily updating.\
\
2) Web edge collection accompanying the built in Solr files\
\
Is there any way to copy that [[Process Scheduler History of
Instructions INTACT with the
settings]{style="text-decoration: underline"}]{style="font-weight: bold"}?\
Table\_API\_p.html\
\
We cannot afford to lose the data and web edge cross references built
up, now, inside \...\
In the worst case, we would like to take the Solr save (and what else?)
and match it with the Table\_API\_p.html instructions in a clean copy of
YaCy.\
\
Many thanks\...
