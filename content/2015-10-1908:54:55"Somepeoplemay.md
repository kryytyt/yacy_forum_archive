> Rebellious plaques have been situated on benches in Chester with the
> intention of highlighting Cheshire West and Chester City council\'s
> \'draconian plans\' to introduce a Public Space Protection Order
> (PSPO). \[\...\] Among the scourges already in the sights of the
> Labour-led Cheshire West and Chester Council are legal highs, street
> drinking, rough sleeping, begging, busking and feeding birds. The idea
> is backed by the Tory opposition.
>
> The plaques have now been removed and Maria Byrne, head of place
> operations for Cheshire West and Chester Council, said: \"We have
> removed the plaques from five benches and although they may appear
> humorous, some people may find them offensive.\"

offended? I\'m offended *all the time*. It\'s called *not being dead
