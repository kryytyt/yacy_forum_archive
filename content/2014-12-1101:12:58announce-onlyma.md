announce-only mailing list
==========================

I\'m still using SmartList from Procmail. Pity me.

I\'m beginning to suspect that its bounce detection is no longer working
reliably (the bit that goes \"unsubscribe someone after mail to them has
bounced N times\"), but it\'s such an obfuscated line-noise piece of
shit that\... I don\'t even.

It\'s written in a combination of Procmail and sh, you see. Yeah.
That\'s a thing. Or was, in the early 90s, when this thing was last
actively maintained.

But my experience is that Mailman is even worse.

Do I still really have no choice other than \"hire a spammer\"?

This is for the DNA Lounge weekly mailing. That\'s the *only* mailing
list I have left. But it is still a thing that must exist.

Features I want:

-   Handles mail with \"subscribe\" or \"unsubscribe\" in the subject or
    body.
-   Sends a confirmation message to validate the address before adding
    it.
-   Auto-unsubscribes after bounces.
-   Does not require me to expose a new web page to end users.

That\'s it. If it has other features, those features can actually be
considered \"liabilities\" rather than \"features\".

Am I screwed?
