Is there really no mechanism to automatically remove the oldest/least
accessed data once we approach the upper limits of the server? One would
think this would be the way to do things and that it would be important
to keep the node stable. I can\'t see a use case for where we should
prefer a crash or lockup over removing the oldest data\... unless I miss
something.\

On a positive note yaCy is one of the most beautiful and well designed
projects I have ever seen. The web admin is simply amazing. You can tell
there are some people involved in the project who really care about it.
