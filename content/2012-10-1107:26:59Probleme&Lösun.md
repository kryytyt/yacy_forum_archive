We don\'t always know the hostnames, so the best we could do is supply a
regex\
to divide the crawling. We feel the yacy server\[s\] can hold and index
the crawl data\
but want to split the crawling job across crawl servers for speed, etc.
We would actually\
want each user facing search server to carry the results from all the
subset crawls,\
not just the regex crawl done by that particular server. Not sure if
your \'not using\
index distribution DHT\' would prohibit that? ie: There would need to be
some sort of\
index distribution into or awareness amongst the user facing search
engines about\
which engine to find the result if the front engine didn\'t have it.\

Still getting used to yacy models so my terms are probably way off

I looked around sciencenet and didn\'t see their config posted?
