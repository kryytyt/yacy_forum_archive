thats right. well its simple: when doing a search to other peers, there
must be a time-out, waiting for more results. If that happens, the first
result page is shown completely, but meanwhile more results may get in;
that is not stopped when the first results are shown. Doing a second
search will simply put you into a situation where more results have been
collected meanwhile.\

There is actual no distinguishing between .html servlet results and
.json or .rss results. So I have do explanation for your observatuion.\

This is open for research. I actually don\'t know. You can develop a
\'rule of thumb\' for your own application. I experimented with time
ranges from 3-10 seconds. Most important was obviously the waiting time,
not the completeness of the result for the user. But that may be
different for a different type of user.
