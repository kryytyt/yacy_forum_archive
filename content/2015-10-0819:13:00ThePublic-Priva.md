> Today in the US there\'s a massive but invisible industry that records
> the movements of cars around the country. Cameras mounted on cars and
> tow trucks capture license places along with date/time/location
> information, and companies use that data to find cars that are
> scheduled for repossession. One company, Vigilant Solutions, claims to
> collect 70 million scans in the US every month. The companies that
> engage in this business routinely share that data with the police,
> giving the police a steady stream of surveillance information on
> innocent people that they could not legally collect on their own. And
> the companies are already looking for other profit streams, selling
> that surveillance data to anyone else who thinks they have a need for
> it. \[\...\]

> because industry representatives were unable to agree on any
> limitations on something as basic as nonconsensual facial recognition.

> dangers in free societies as well. Without meaningful regulation,
> we\'re moving into a world where governments and corporations will be
> able to identify people both in real time and backwards in time,
> remotely and in secret, without consent or recourse.
