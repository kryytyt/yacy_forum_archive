Add a tranlation master (locales/master.lng.xlf) in xlf format.
This is used by Translator servlet to present text to be translated for 
all languages. The file was created by the entries of the 2 best maintained
languages (ru.lng and de.lng). 
+ add view translation to de.lng and harmonize some entries to master.lng.xlf
