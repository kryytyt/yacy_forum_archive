Hi bubul, yes using Elasticsearch as an alternative to Solr for the
documents index could be interesting. Indeed, that is the solution
retained for the next [YaCy
architecture](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_grid_mcp){.postlink}.\
\
By the way, for the current YaCy search server, as far as I know this
would require quite an amount of refactoring to properly integrate it.
Not the kind of idea you can test quickly in a few hours\...\
\
What\'s more the performance gain is not certain as it depends on the
kind of search requests that are submitted.\
\
Did you try to plug your YaCy server on an external Solr server, as it
is supposed to be more efficient than the default embedded Solr ?
