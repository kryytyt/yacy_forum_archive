May help not to sure because I had a system under 50% CPU load and the
crawler would pause all the time.\
I had to fight with the settings below to get them to survive a
restart.\
Editing yacy.config and the web interface.\
\
Go to /PerformanceQueues\_p.html\
\
Local Crawl milliseconds milliseconds kbytes load\
\
Try increasing the load setting to see if this stabeizes the ppm.\
For a single CPU core in Debian mine is set at 6.\
My P4 HT 3 is set at 32.\
\
You could change the milliseconds but you may loose your reputation for
being a well behaved robot\...\
You could setup a few remote VM\'s and enable remote crawl but then
everybody can use them.
