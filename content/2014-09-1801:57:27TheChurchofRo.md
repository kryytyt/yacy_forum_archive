[Only 70 years until the Robotrons conclude that the human race is
inefficient and must be destroyed. Only the mutant produced by a genetic
engineering error can save us now!](http://churchofrobotron.com/)

> The Church of Robotron is a mobile training facility that uses
> hazardous environments, religious indoctrination, and emotional
> triggers to promote the development of the skills necessary to survive
> in a hostile post-human environment. We hope to use our field
> installation to educate and indoctrinate people about the robot
> uprising in progress. We know that superior machines exist, we know
> that they have already decided that the human race must be destroyed,
> and we know that the only way to convey this knowledge is with a
> visceral and even spiritual ordeal. The savior of our species must be
> identified and trained; the tragic sacrifice of legions of subjects is
> the burden that we must shoulder, lightened only by the willingness
> with which they volunteer for their grisly testing. Please, read our
> literature, attend a sermon or two, tell your friends, and when the
> time comes, report to an orientation session. Survivors will earn the
> exaltation of a grateful humanity. The mightiest will experience the
> glory of the leaderboard and receive useful items. Thank you, it is
> only with your selfless dedication that hope survives.
