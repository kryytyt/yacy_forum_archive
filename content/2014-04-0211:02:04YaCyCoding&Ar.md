What come to my mind with what I\'ve done :\
\
To manage entries in blacklist, I followed what was defined in firefox
extension, you have to use
Blacklist\_p.html?addBlacklistEntry=&currentBlacklist=currentBlacklist&newEntry
and it returns html so get message if action where successful or not
it\'s hard.\
\
It would be nice to have json as output and every time error or success
message to output that directly.\
\
Maybe it could be nice to have full rest api on blacklists, blacklist
entries to create/edit/delete/list those stuffs from outside.
