I invested some work meanwhile in an algorithm to scrape twitter search
results from their html search results. I tried first last year but
stopped when I believed that this work is so absurd since the html is
extremely bloated and so inefficient to use as search result compared to
a true API which was removed. But in January this year I nearly
completed a scraper which is at this time an external project but not a
part of YaCy:\
\
<http://twitterscraper.host-browser.org>\
\
I want to publish the code in the near future as soon as everything is
inside that I want to for the initial source release (mostly license
make-up). The code contains also some \'nasty\' I-am-a-browser-fake
user-agent believe-me stuff which could be fighted back by twitter as
soon as they read the source code. Without pretending that the scraper
is a browser it does not work. Therefore this code can not be included
into YaCy because I think that this could harm the \"properly-behaved
robot\" status.
