> had been walking north when he was hit in the thigh by a long metal
> dart which penetrated his jeans and skin by approximately 1-2 inches.
>
> As officers were speaking with the first victim, a second victim
> approached the group to say she had also been struck by a dart.
>
> The victim was walking north on the east side foot path as well when
> she was struck in the knee cap by an identical dart.
>
> Both victims were treated by paramedics and released at the scene.
>
> The darts are made from a metal body approximately 5 inches long with
> one end sharpened to a fine point. The tail of the dart is topped with
> a white plastic cap which allows the dart to be from a blow gun.
