English â€¢ transition Robinson to P2P & adding a new server safely
=================================================================

Date: 2014-10-06 19:31:04

HI, We currently have 2 servers - one in each of 2 ubuntu clouds.\
They write only to themselves and they are separate.\
However, they can read each other to give combined results in a single
window, via one of the engines.\
\
We want to safely migrate them to a shared storage environment,
optimizing storage use across the 2 servers.\
Network Configuration:\
yacy.network.allip.unit\
\
In /ConfigNetwork\_p.html\
They are both set as Robinson Mode\
Public Peer\
\
/IndexFederated\_p.html\
\
Lazy Value Initialization\
Use deep-embedded local Solr\
Use remote Solr server(s) (format\
Solr Hosts\
Solr Host Administration Interface\
Index Size\
<http://xxx.xxx.x.xx:8090/solr/admin/>194358\
Solr URL(s)\
NOT write-enabled (if unchecked, the remote server(s) will only be used
as search peers)\
\
\
It is potentially possible that there are some duplicate documents in
both clouds.\
\
We have over 44 million web edges now - and the servers are reporting
together.\
\
Question 1\
How do we safely transition to Peer-to-Peer mode as a separate search
cluster with connection only to our own servers?\
Key is not to lose our large databases across 2 servers.\
Question 2\
Will this find and eliminate any duplicates?\
Question 3\
Will moving to this p2p mode result in smaller storage or larger storage
needs?\
Question 4\
Will this load balance the storage of data across the two servers?\
Question 5\
We are running out of storage space.\
When we will soon add another server (a 3rd) what is the safe procedure
for this, please?\
Is there any leveling effect or data shifting when the new server is
added, or will the 3rd server remain largely empty int he beginning?\
Our ultimate goal is to evenly distribute search results across all
servers.\
Many thanks.\
\
Notes:\
Remote Crawler Configuration /RemoteCrawl\_p.html\
\"Your peer cannot accept remote crawls because you need senior or
principal peer status for that!\"\
How do we fix that?\
We want all our peers to be basically \'local\' to each other\'\...no
\'out of center\' \'far away\' circles with different DBs\
Thank you
