Hello ktplulo,\
\
by \"Documents\" we mean the information of pages, pictures, files, etc,
that where indexed. Sometimes we use \'URLs\' as synonym for that\
By \"DHT Words\" we mean database-entrys of (hashed) words from
Documents an where to find them in the documents-database. That why it
also called RWI (reverse word index).\
Counting these values is just an information for people, looking at them

\
The more documents you have - the more entrys could be found on your
local-machine.\
The dht-words are primary used to be distributed in the p2p-network in
order to concentrate documents for words on machines in the network.\
\
YaCy is robust against deleting the one ore other, but deleted dht-words
can\'t be distributed and deleted documents can\'t be found or
distributed.\
Since we switched to store documents in solr every document can also be
found - even if there is no dht-word pointing at them.\
\
If you delete things for a domain you delete the documents for a
domain.\
If you deleted all domains your index shoud be very smal now

\
The delete-options for words may be a little outdated. If your realy
whant to delete a word it is ok to do it without any options.\
If you also whant delete the documents for a word use that option.\
