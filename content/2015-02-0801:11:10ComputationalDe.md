- MIT Media Lab, Course Description:](http://novysan.com/magic)

> When Aleister Crowley defined magic as \"the Science and Art of
> causing Change to occur in conformity with Will,\" he might as easily
> have been describing technology. In fact, \"magic\" is still the word
> we use to encompass the wonders of a new technology before it becomes
> ubiquitous. \[\...\]
>
> With a focus on the creation of functional prototypes and practicing
> real magical crafts, this class combines theatrical illusion, game
> design, sleight of hand, machine learning, camouflage, and
> neuroscience to explore how ideas from ancient magic and modern stage
> illusion can inform cutting edge technology.
>
> Topics will include:
>
> -   Stage Illusion as Information Display
> -   The Neuroscience of Misdirection
> -   Magical Warfare: Camouflage and Deception
> -   Magic Items and the Internet of Things
> -   Computational Demonology
> -   Ritual Magick as User Experience Design
