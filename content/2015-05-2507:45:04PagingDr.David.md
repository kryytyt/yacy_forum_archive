and facial
hallucinations:](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)61690-1/fulltext)

> In July, 2011, a 52-year-old woman presented to our psychiatric
> outpatient clinic in The Hague with a life-long history of seeing
> people\'s faces change into dragon-like faces and hallucinating
> similar faces many times a day. She could perceive and recognise
> actual faces, but after several minutes they turned black, grew long,
> pointy ears and a protruding snout, and displayed a reptiloid skin and
> huge eyes in bright yellow, green, blue, or red.
>
> She saw similar dragon-like faces drifting towards her many times a
> day from the walls, electrical sockets, or the computer screen, in
> both the presence and absence of face-like patterns, and at night she
> saw many dragon-like faces in the dark.
>
> The woman suffered from prosopometamorphopsia, a psychiatric disorder
> that causes faces to appear distorted. Even within the context of the
> condition, the woman\'s case was rare in the specificity of her
> hallucinations.
