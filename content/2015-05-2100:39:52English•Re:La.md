English â€¢ Re: Language filter ineffective

I have taken the time to extract the relevant data from the
above-mentioned package and pack the files into a working example, here
attached.\
The example is self-explanatory.\
\

Code: 
:   `apt-get install nodejstar -axf LanguageDetect.tar.gzcd ./scriptsnodejs languageDetectDemo.js`

\
\
You\'ll notice the algorithm is very simple. The key is in [the sorting
order of the vocabularies and their
size]{style="text-decoration: underline"}. Remember this when creating
additional vocabularies:\

-   word count per dictionary must be preserved at about 1000. Deviation
    from this will cause bias.
-   words must be sorted from the most frequently used in such language
    to the least used. The dictionary actually contains only the top
    thousand words by frequency.

\
[Edit:]{style="font-weight: bold"} if you get a syntax error, [nodejs
v0.12](https://nodejs.org/){.postlink} is required.
