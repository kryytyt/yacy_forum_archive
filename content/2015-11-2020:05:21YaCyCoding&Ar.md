Hello, it has been a while since last post\... but image processing is
not so easy, and when you think you improved something, you might easily
have broken something else.\
But I have done my best on time available, passed many tests, and have
some code to share with you :
.<https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/pull/26>.\
There is still much to be done on the subject, and I will share with you
once I have something tested and working!
