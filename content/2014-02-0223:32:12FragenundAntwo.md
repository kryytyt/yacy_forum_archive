The bigger your index grows, the more ram it needs. There\'s nothing you
can do about it. You probably should stop crawling new pages before
it\'s getting too big, and uncheck \"Index Receive\" in the network
configuration: <http://localhost:8090/ConfigNetwork_p.html>. If you want
to index additional pages, you either have to upgrade your RAM or start
a new index on another computer.\

Wow. This should not be necessary. Under normal circumstances a healthy
peer should be able to run for several days, weeks or even months
without the need for restarting.\

I\'m not 100% sure, but as far as I know, with 15GB of RAM you should be
able to maintain an index with 50\'000\'000-60\'000\'000 links. So with
3.5GB you probably can run an index with 10\'000\'000-12\'000\'000
links. But as I said, I\'m not really sure about this. It depends on
many different factors.
