YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: Commit 136e8f6 and 1-char queries
==================================================================

That change was made by me because one of my customers are running YaCy
in their intranet for file search and they had truble finding files by
their file name using an exact copy of the file name. The problem is,
that the file indexing stripes aways \'rubbish\' from file names (i.e.
single numeric characters) and it was not possible to find the same
files again with a copy of the file name.\

No, this is actually [less]{style="font-style: italic"} selective, you
would be able to find \"[The incredibles
4]{style="font-style: italic"}\" but also \"[The incredibles
3]{style="font-style: italic"}\", \"[The incredibles
2]{style="font-style: italic"}\" and \"[The
incredibles]{style="font-style: italic"}\" by just searching for \"[The
incredibles 4]{style="font-style: italic"}\". This change applies a
special way of fuzzyness and I believe a wanted one.
