Fixed YaCy proper shutdown triggered by SIGTERM signal.

The main shutdown hook thread was not properly waiting for the main
thread termination which consequently could not properly close resources
and threads. After terminating a running YaCy peer this way (Ctrl+C in
console, or kill <pid> for example), you could see the still existing
DATA/yacy.running file.

Tested with :
 - Debian Jessie openjdk 7 and 8 : regular shutdown, Ctrl+C, kill
command, system restart while yacy is running
 - Windows 10 Oracle JDK 7 and 8 : non regression on regular shutdown
```
