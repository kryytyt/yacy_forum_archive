HI\... thank you for the idea\
However, when I did that, I still got this kind of message:\
\

> <div>
>
> \
> HTTP ERROR: 403\
> \
> Problem accessing /Settings\_p.html. Reason:\
> \
> proxy use not allowed (see Advanced Settings -\> HTTP Networking -\>
> Transparent Proxy; switched off).\
>
> </div>

\
\
How do I get behind this into the area where this is \' decided \'
please.\
Many thanks!
