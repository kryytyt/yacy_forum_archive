I told you so, again

![](http://www.jwz.org/images/theclapgy0wl5.gif)If you are not running
[xscreensaver](http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/) on Linux, then it is
safe to assume that your screen does not lock.

Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. Three times is enemy action.
Four times is Official GNOME Policy.

[CVE-2014-1949:](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/327)

> -   Press the \'Menu\' key on the keyboard
> -   Press \'Esc\'
> -   Focus is now beneath the screen locker
> -   Press Alt+F2
> -   Start \'gnome-terminal\'

This was sent to
[bugtraq](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/535119/30/0/) a couple
days ago, but it was actually reported two months *before* the similar
GNOME bug that [I ridiculed last
year](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/04/the-awful-thing-about-getting-it-right-the-first-time-is-that-nobody-realizes-how-hard-it-was/).

And here\'s another variant of it from August, which is possibly even
easier: [\"Holding menu key causes window flood and desktop
freeze.\"](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/3443) This
probably means \"hold down the Menu or Super key and wait for
gnome-screensaver to run out of memory and crash, unlocking the
screen.\"
