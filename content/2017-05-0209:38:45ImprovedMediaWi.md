Improved MediaWiki dump import monitoring.

When import thread is terminated :
 - now stop refreshing and stay on the monitoring page to give user a
feedback after a long running import
 - added link to the next monitoring step : results from surrogates
reader
 - added link to new import
 
On the new import page, added a link on the eventual last import report.
```
