corporations got their own private legal
system](http://boingboing.net/2015/10/02/arbitration-how-americas-co.html)

> In 1925, the Supreme Court ruled that corporations of similar size and
> bargaining power could use arbitration, rather than courts, to settle
> their differences; today, corporations demand that customers and
> employees agree to use the arbitration system for redress of any
> grievances, while reserving the right to use the courts to attack
> humans who offend them. \[\...\]
>
> The largest arbitration company in America, the for-profit National
> Arbitration Foundation, is owned by investors who also own one of the
> country\'s largest debt-collection agency \-- and many debt-collection
> cases get settled in arbitration.
>
> How unbalanced is arbitration? Out of 18,075 debt-collection cases
> handled in California by the NAF, just 30 were settled in favor of
> humans. When humans do win against companies, they collect much
> smaller settlements than they would in court, too.
