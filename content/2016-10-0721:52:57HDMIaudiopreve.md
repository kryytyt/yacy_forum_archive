HDMI audio prevents screen saver, still
=======================================

MacOS 10.12 still has the ridiculous bug that if your system audio
output is set to HDMI, and iTunes is playing, then the screen saver will
never activate and your screen will never lock.

[In 10.8 through
10.10,](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/03/hdmi-audio-prevents-screen-saver/)
the fix for this was to hack the `coreaudiod` binary.

[In
10.11,](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/11/hdmi-audio-prevents-screen-saver-2/)
the system wouldn\'t run the new `coreaudiod` unless it was signed.
Solution: sign it with your own key, because they accepted *any*
signature.

Well, in 10.12, that doesn\'t work any more. Copy the executable and it
works; re-sign it and it doesn\'t. Presumably they are checking for an
*Apple* signature now.

Any ideas of another workaround?

I happen to like having my machine be secure even if it happens to be
playing music. How weird.
