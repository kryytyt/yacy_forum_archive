> This truly spectacular specimen is possibly the longest example of
> coprolite - fossilized dinosaur feces - ever to be offered at auction.
> It boasts a wonderfully even, pale brown-yellow coloring and
> terrifically detailed texture to the heavily botryoidal surface across
> the whole of its immense length. The passer of this remarkable object
> is unknown, but it is nonetheless a highly evocative specimen of
> unprecedented size, presented in four sections, each with a heavy
> black marble custom base, an eye-watering 40 inches in length overall.
>
> *Miocene-Oligocene Wilkes Formation, Toledo, Lewis Co., Washington.*
