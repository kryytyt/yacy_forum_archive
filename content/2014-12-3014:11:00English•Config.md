English â€¢ Config pls New Cloud Group + Migration of Robinson Servers
====================================================================

Hello.\
Please we are setting up a private group of new YaCy servers which will
be in full P2P with DHT. We need your \' seasoned \' advice, please.
Thanks.\
\
1. We need the [[Current Best Practices
Instructions]{style="text-decoration: underline"}]{style="font-weight: bold"}
on prefered configuration for this new group of cloud servers, starting
with 3 new servers that are \' UP \' and functioning now in stand alone
Robinson mode.\
We will continue to add more servers to the private group.\
The servers in the new group are currently identical to each other.\
The servers can currently read each other\'s Solr files, but they cannot
write to each other.\
This means the the new cloud servers were set up, one by one, in
Robinson mode with cross reading privileges between servers.\
Now they need to be changed to the fully shared and standard YaCy
environment for private groups of servers working together.\
We wish these to be in the full DHT P2P mode as a private network.\
\
We appreciate this requires more space and we have cloud computing and
storage capacity assigned for this - in and across the clouds.\
\
+\
2. We have 2 prior Robinson servers that need to be migrated to this new
group, described above.\
They each have somewhat less than 20 GB of DATA Sets, each.\
This data must be retained and moved to the new P2P DHT environment
safely.\
\
We understand that the function of the environment is such that as this
data is migrated, duplicates will be eliminated as part of the standard
indexing process.\
Is this correct?\
\
How do we safely change their Robinson configurations to become part of
the new private DHT P2P group.\
Essential is that they not lose the data they have collected and
indexed.\
\
3. As noted: Our ultimate goal is to migrate the data the earlier two
Robinson servers have independently collected and move it to the pool of
data among the others - in the framework of the new collective,
described above.\
The result is that there will no longer be any Robinson servers (-0-).\
All servers will be in a secured private P2P group with DHT.\
All 5 servers (initially) will become part of the private pool of
servers in full P2P with DHT - but as a stand alone private network of
cloud servers with appropriate security features protecting it from the
outside.\
\
The environment will be fed data, and read by standard approaches to a
YaCy server. We are assuming that this distributed computational
environment will create a kind of load sharing for crawling and search
results generation.\
Traffic is still light.\
\
Thank you for your careful, precise and detailed instructions and
guidance. No detail is too small, please. [[Please Assume that we do not
know what may seem obvious to
you]{style="text-decoration: underline"}]{style="font-style: italic"}.
Thanks for your patience!

PMs are very OK, too. Many Thanks, once again!
