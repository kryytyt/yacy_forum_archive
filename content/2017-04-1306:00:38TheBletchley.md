> The Bletchley is a spy-themed London bar where you have to crack codes

> To do that, you use imitation World War 2 Enigma machines which
> generate a unique code for every \"agent.\" Orders are then
> transmitted via radio to the bar.
>
> The venue is inspired by Bletchley Park, the site where British
> mathematician and codebreaker Alan Turing and his team used to crack
> German codes during World War 2.

This is gorgeous, but two things:

1.  When I see a bar that seems to have made it *very difficult to get
    drunk,* I can\'t help but think, *YOU HAD ONE JOB.*
2.  The plastic wrap atop the Enigma machines really detracts. (Also it
    was only introduced commercially in 1949!)
