> Before about 25 years ago, the species simply did not exist. A single
> drastic mutation in a single crayfish produced the marbled crayfish in
> an instant. \[\...\] \"We may never have caught the genome of a
> species so soon after it became a species,\" said Zen Faulkes, a
> biologist at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, who was not
> involved in the new study. \[\...\]

> As marmorkrebs became more popular, owners grew increasingly puzzled.
> The crayfish seemed to be laying eggs without mating. The progeny were
> all female, and each one grew up ready to reproduce. \[\...\] \"People

> The scientists concluded that the new species got its start when two
> slough crayfish mated. One of them had a mutation in a sex cell \--
> whether it was an egg or sperm, the scientists can\'t tell.
>
> Normal sex cells contain a single copy of each chromosome. But the
> mutant crayfish sex cell had two. Somehow the two sex cells fused and
> produced a female crayfish embryo with three copies of each chromosome
> instead of the normal two. Somehow, too, the new crayfish didn\'t
> suffer any deformities as a result of all that extra DNA.

> It grew and thrived. But instead of reproducing sexually, the first
> marbled crayfish was able to induce her own eggs to start dividing
> into embryos. The offspring, all females, inherited identical copies
> of her three sets of chromosomes. They were clones.
>
> Now that their chromosomes were mismatched with those of slough
> crayfish, they could no longer produce viable offspring. Male slough
> crayfish will readily mate with the marbled crayfish, but they never
> father any of the offspring. \[\...\]

> Thanks to the young age of the species, marbled crayfish could shed
> light on one of the big mysteries about the animal kingdom: why so
> many animals have sex. Only about 1 in 10,000 species comprise cloning
> females. Many studies suggest that sex-free species are rare because
> they don\'t last long. \[\...\]

> There are a lot of clear advantages to being a clone. Marbled crayfish
