> The massive door is made of 40 sections of thick Burma teak and sits
> between the entrance\'s concrete walls. Each section has been carved
> to incorporate 160 pulleys, 80 ball bearings, one wire rope, and a
> hidden counterweight. When closed, the door just looks like a huge,
> horizontally slatted wood door. Push on the door and the wood feathers
> out into a beautiful curve.
