> Plaza Hotel in Syracuse, New York back in April 2011 when she went to
> the hotel\'s Library Lounge bar. Syracuse.com reports that Ms. Allison
> claims that while waiting for food in the Library Lounge, she fell off
> of a \"wooden, high-back bar stool,\" and landed on her wrist, causing
> multiple fractures that required surgery. She is now suing the hotel
> for \$1 million.
>
> In her lawsuit, Ms. Allison claims that the bar stool was too high off
> the ground, and that, \"hotel management knew of other problems with
> the height of the stools.\" Her lawyer, Mark Ventrone, wrote in a 2012
> complaint that, \"Said bar stools were more dangerous than patrons
> would expect and safer designs are on the marketplace.\"
