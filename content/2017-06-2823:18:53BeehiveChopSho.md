> Earlier this year, around \$1 million worth of stolen bees were found
> in a field in Fresno County. Sgt. Arley Terrence with the Fresno
> County Sheriff\'s Department says it was a \"beehive chop shop.\"
> \[\...\]
>
> \"This is the biggest bee theft investigation that we\'ve had,\"
> Terrence says. Most of the time, he says, beehive thieves turn out to
> be \"someone within the bee community.\"
>
> That was the case in the giant heist earlier this year. The alleged
> thief, Pavel Tveretinov, was a beekeeper from Sacramento who used the
> stolen bees for pollination and then stashed them on a plot of land in
> Fresno County. He was arrested and could face around 10 years of jail
> time. And authorities say he didn\'t act alone. His alleged
> accomplice, Vitaliy Yeroshenko, has been charged and a warrant is out
> for his arrest.
>
> Steve Godlin with the California State Beekeepers Association says the
> problem of hive theft gets worse every year. \"There used to be kind
> of a code of honor that you didn\'t mess with another man\'s bees,\"
> Godlin says.
