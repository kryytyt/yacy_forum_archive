> AUSTIN, TX \-- While attending the fourth day of this year\'s SXSW
> conference, Chicago-based marketing associate Tim Danner told
> reporters today that the music, film, and interactive festival is just
> about as cool, as alternative, and as real as it gets. \"The great
> thing about South By is that practically everyone here is talking
> about the newest cutting-edge ideas, but the whole scene still has
> this super-chill underground vibe,\" said the 33-year-old who went to
> business school, makes a six-figure salary, and develops marketing
> strategies for a living. \"What I like most of all is that it\'s not
> in New York or Los Angeles, but in Austin, which is like this cool
> little artsy town. That\'s so awesome and so authentic, you know? And
> there are so many great indie rock bands playing here, too. I love
> indie rock music.\" At press time, Danner was attending his 15th
> straight panel on the future of digital.
