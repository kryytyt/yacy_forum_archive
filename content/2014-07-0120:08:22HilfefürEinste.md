Since early this morning, the link to my Cacti server referred in the
previous message was taken down by Microsoft, one among many others that
were using the free DNS No-IP service.\
\
The story can be read in deeper details here:

If Microsoft feels it has the right to seize a legal service because two
persons were abusing it, why can\'t I seize hotmail domain, since it is
also obviously misused by spammers and other types of
\"cybercriminals\"?
