> San Francisco could use a little more room, couldn\'t it? The
> progressive supervisor triumvirate of Jane Kim, Aaron Peskin, and
> David Campos will present a resolution today that could eventually
> give it some, the Chronicle reports, exploring a controversial plan to
> annex our city\'s southern neighbor, Brisbane, to make it a part of
> SF.
>
> While that municipality (population 4,000) prepares to build a massive
> commercial development called the Brisbane Baylands, it appears
> unwilling to concurrently introduce new housing units, angering
> supervisors like Jane Kim, who claimed last week that Brisbane sought
> commercial benefits while foregoing its housing responsibilities.
> Those would instead fall to San Francisco.
>
> Baylands is a plot of more than 680 acres next to Highway 101. In
> August, the Brisbane Planning Commission recommended \"that no housing
> be allowed on this site,\" and Brisbane\'s Mayor Cliff Lentz is quoted
> as having said \"There\'s all this housing on the SF side\... We\'ll
> provide the commercial \-- SF will provide the housing.\" \[\...\]

> In order to make a reality of Brannex, as many people and certainly
> not just one SFist editor are referring to the idea, \"landowners
> owning 50 percent or more of the assessed value of the land within the
> territory,\" would need to approve it. And this might be attractive to
> landowners who believe a San Francisco address will mean an automatic
> bump in value. (Brisbane is, in case you didn\'t know, right on SF\'s
> border, south of Visitiacion Valley, north of South San Francisco.)
>
> Last week, San Francisco Chamber of Commerce Senior Vice President Jim
> Lazarus suggested one reason why Brisbane might be reluctant to create
> new housing. \"Brisbane\'s concern is political,\" he said per the
> Chronicle. \"They don\'t want 4,000 new voting residents.\" And as San
> Mateo County Supervisor Adrienne Tissier, whose district includes
> Brisbane put it, \"It\'s easy to take all the revenue and not take any
> responsibility for the people.\"
