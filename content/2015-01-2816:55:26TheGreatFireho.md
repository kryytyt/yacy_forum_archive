The Great Firehose of China is aimed at me again
================================================

![](http://www.jwz.org/images/under_attack_pleas_stand_by_by_heder.png)Our
friends in China took a dump on my server
[again](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/01/chinese-bittorrent-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving/)
this morning, despite the \~900 networks I had blocked in iptables.

I updated the list from
[here](http://www.wizcrafts.net/chinese-iptables-blocklist.html) but
that didn\'t help.

So I grabbed every IP that hit me this morning with an incorrect
\"Host:\" header, constructed a /24 from that, and blocked that too.
That was 3000+ netmasks, and is obviously not the right netmask, but it
took the traffic down to a more manageable dull roar.

Has anyone yet worked out a more effective way of coping with this
Chinese DNS poisoning?

I\'m also really curious about how my IP keeps getting targeted. Are
they really just picking a random number and I keep getting lucky, or is
there some dickwad in a Chinese ISP smirking as he aims the firehose at
me specifically? Is my blog or my bar considered counterrevolutionary?
