YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Re: WebRTC for YaCy: p2p in browser plug-in
========================================================================

To my mind, such a plug-in should have p2p search capabilities, relying
on YaCy peers network, but should stay as minimalist and efficient as
possible as it would \'only\' be a browser plug-in. It should be able to
store only data in volatile memory if user want so, relying only on DHT
index at browser startup.
