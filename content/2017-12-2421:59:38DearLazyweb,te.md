I\'m a Sonic customer, I have access to their VPN and I\'d like to use
it with my iPhone and iPad. They recommend the \"OpenVPN Connect\" app,
but it kind of sucks.

It\'s supposed to re-connect, but it never does. It\'s rare that the VPN
stays up for longer than a couple of hours. If I\'m lucky, I notice that
there\'s no longer a tiny \"VPN\" logo at the top of the screen, and I
have to launch the app manually and flick the \"connect\" checkbox
again. You\'d think that clicking the \"VPN\" checkbox in Settings would
work. It doesn\'t. It tries to connect and fails. Often (maybe always?)
with \"authentication failed\". The only thing that works is launching
the OpenVPN app and clicking the checkbox there, multiple times a day.
It happens so often that I might as well not have a VPN.

And it\'s unconscionable that when it drops my VPN connection, it does
so silently. \"Oh, we just downgraded your security! I\'m sure that\'s
totally what you wanted, and you don\'t need an alert about it!\"

Second, there appears to be no host, network, or IP-based whitelist. I
want my mobile devices to *not* use the VPN when they are attached to my
home network. First so that I can access my home devices, but also
because that would be redundant, as my home network\'s first hop is
Sonic.

Is there an iOS VPN client that is compatible with
[ovpn.sonic.net](https://ovpn.sonic.net/) that sucks less than \"OpenVPN
Connect\"? Or is there some other pile of settings that I missed?

***PLEASE NOTE:*** I am 100% uninterested in your rambling story about
the VPN service that you used that is not ovpn.sonic.net.
