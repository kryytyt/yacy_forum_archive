> Melania Trump\'s lawyers alleged in a lawsuit filed Monday that the
> First Lady\'s \"unique once-in-a-lifetime\" opportunity to profit from
> her White House role was damaged by a Daily Mail article claiming she
> once worked as an escort.
>
> The suit, filed in New York State Supreme Court against the tabloid\'s
> owner, Mail Media, seeks compensatory and punitive damages of at least
> \$150 million.
>
> > \"Plaintiff had the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as an
> > extremely famous and well-known person, as well as a former
> > professional model and brand spokesperson, and a successful
> > businesswoman, to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple
> > product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million
> > dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which
> > plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world. These
> > product categories would have included, among other things, apparel,
> > accessories, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care, skin care and
> > fragrance.\"
>
> The lawsuit alleges that Trump\'s reputation was undermined at a
> particularly opportune moment by the Mail article, which published
> unsubstantiated allegations from a Slovenian magazine that the First
> Lady had worked for an escort service. That article was eventually
> retracted.
>
> The First Lady\'s lawyer, Charles Harder, announced on Tuesday that
> she had agreed to settle for a \"substantial sum\" with a Maryland
> blogger who also published a post about the escort allegations. In a
> statement provided to TPM by Harder\'s office, blogger Webster Tarpley
> said his story was \"replete with false and defamatory statements\"
> that he \"fully\" retracted.
>
> Harder has been retained by many high-profile clients, includuing
> disgraced Fox News CEO Roger Ailes. Last year, Trump ally Peter Thiel
> paid Harder to represent former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan, whose given
> name is Terry Bollea, in an invasion-of-privacy suit against Gawker
> Media. The suit resulted in the media company\'s bankruptcy.
