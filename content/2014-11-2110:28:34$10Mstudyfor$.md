\$10M study for \$1B bike path.
===============================

This is idiotic.

[A Bay Area Toll Authority committee voted Wednesday to pay a consultant
\$10 million to produce a proposal for an Oakland-to-SF
crossing.](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Plan-for-Bay-Bridge-bike-path-from-Oakland-to-5889208.php)

> Earlier estimates of the cost of a bike path, most likely attached to
> the sides of the approximately 2-mile western suspension span, placed
> the price at \$400 million to \$500 million. \[\...\] Because

Are you fucking kidding me? Can you imagine what *a billion dollars* of
bike-infrastructure improvements in the city would look like?

Neither can I. But it wouldn\'t look like a *single bike lane, hanging
in the wind off a bridge.*

Can you imagine what even *ten million dollars* of bike-infrastructure
improvements in the city would look like?

Actually, I can: it would look like [*more than
half*](http://blog.sfgate.com/bicycle/2014/04/21/new-sfmta-budget-a-qualified-win-for-bicycle-infrastructure/)
of SFMTA\'s 2015 budget for bike infrastructure (\$17.8M). Instead,
we\'ll get a stack of design-fiction drawings from some parasitic
consultancy. What the *what?*

Obviously improving bicycling infrastructure is a topic relevant to my
interests, but this is a comically catastrophic use of public funds.
Give me protected bike lanes on every major road in the city first, and
you know what? I\'ll take the fucking train when I have to cross the
bay.
