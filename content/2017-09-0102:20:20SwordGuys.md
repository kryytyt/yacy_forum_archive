> I genuinely think there\'s no better demonstration of sexism in our

> (and I do not mean to disparage either). This is despite the fact that

> have, let\'s say, more than three cats before her cat ownership
> becomes a lifestyle statement and people deem her a \"cat lady.\" But
> if a guy just mounts a single katana on his wall he is saying,
> \"That\'s it, this is me now.\" Yet we never talk about sword guys?
