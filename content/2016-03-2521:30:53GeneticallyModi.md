> Maggots munch away dead tissue, but also \"change the pH of the
> wound,\" Scott said, by secreting ammonia and making it more alkaline,
> and thus less friendly to invasive bacteria. \"They also secrete
> antimicrobial peptides,\" he said. The bugs can be effective against
> MRSA, for example, a particularly fearsome drug-resistant bug.

> growth and survival.
