Hello, in the end there were some points to fix on the the
webstructure.xml API and the HostBrowser.html page.\
\
Improvements and eventually fixes are still possible, but I already
pushed some modifications on GitHub, notably related to
[https/http](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commit/ed3dd5e31a9177a4b1c3957fdce7a9b8b2859265){.postlink}.
I also
[added](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commit/e048e74072b64422f1a7a0c79018f1d1e5f1b88c){.postlink}
a supplementary optional parameter on the webstructure.xml api to
control if you want or not to reload and parse the document at the
\'about\' url. This option may be interesting for your performance
issue, as I did not found valuable optimizations on the core of the
webstructure.xml algorithm without breaking its compressed memory data
structure .\
\
Best regards
