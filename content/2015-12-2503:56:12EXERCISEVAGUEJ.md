Last night, someone asked me if my [surveillance camera sign
modification art
project](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/09/exercise-vague-caution/) was
[still
ongoing](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/09/exercise-vague-spartacus/).
Sadly, the answer is no. I kept it up for about two months, but after a
while it stopped feeling like a twice-daily opportunity to make a snarky
joke about fear-based complicity in ubiquitous, asymmetric surveillance,
and more like a chore coupled with an opportunity to [argue with
idiots](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/10/exercising-my-vague-caution/).

Also I was sad that even though I got emails saying \"Keep it up!\" from
a few other tenants of my building, when I was out of town for a week,
nobody was willing to step up and continue the stickering in my absence.
Throw me a bone here, people.

Anyway, this year someone put a Christmas tree in our lobby. It had
lights but no ornaments, and last night, when I was having some of my
\"thinkin\' juice\" and got that question about the stickers, I said to
myself I said, \"You know what I *oughtta* do..!\"

I thought this was funny enough that I braved *Target* on Christmas Eve.
I hope you appreciate the hardships I endure for comedy.

I regret that my handwriting is not what it could be, but apparently I
don\'t know anyone whose handwriting is any better. And uh, who was
willing to come over and sit on my floor and doodle on my balls on short
notice.

Happy Surveillmas, everybody!

And stop touching yourself.
