You are probably right Choey and the Linkedin profile of jc gryson seems
to confirm that.\

At the time he sent the message on this forum he also sent me a private

To complete the updates on this post I also have to say I contacted some

from NLNet, and the Internet Freedom Fund answered they were \"not able
to provide financial support for your project at this time\".
