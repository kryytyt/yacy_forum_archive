Try this. I am not sure if it will work on you version of Ubuntu 13.04\
Its what I use everywhere for Ubuntu and Debian.\
\
If you have java already installed the start at \"apt-get -y install
git\"\
\
Its Double spaced for a reason. If you highlight the code the move to
the blank line and copy you add a Carriage return to the clip board
data. If you don\'t wish this to happen then copy from the same line
that you highlighted. Note It won\'t work with sudo apt-get install -y
\*\*\*\* commands\
\
Open a Terminal as root, I\'m open to discussion on the method, but it
is harder for a causal user to mess things up.\
\
cd /usr\
\
echo \"deb <http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu> precise
main\" \| tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/webupd8team-java.list\
\
echo \"deb-src <http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu>
precise main\" \| tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/webupd8team-java.list\
\
apt-key adv \--keyserver
[hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80](hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80){.postlink}
\--recv-keys EEA14886\
\
sudo apt-get update\
\
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer\
\
Note: You can change \"java7\" to \"java8\" if needed and you have to
also have to agree to the license so the double space stops at this
point.\
\
\
sudo apt-get -y install git\
\
sudo apt-get -y install ant\
\
sudo apt-get -y install curl\
\
To a directory/folder of your choice. I use /usr\
\
cd /usr\
\
git clone <https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server>\
\
cd yacy\_search\_server\
\
ant clean all\
\
./startYACY.sh\
\
Optional:\
To set admin password but once familiar you could have any name in the
admin account for higher security level.\
bin/passwd.sh Space + Yourpassword\
\
You can also shorten the \"yacy\" path to make it easy on the
keystrokes.[ Must be Done when Stopped.]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
The above install can also be started from / by typing
/usr/yacy\_search\_server/startYACY.sh and then edit start to stop in
the console by deleting 3 \"art\" and adding 2 \"op\".
