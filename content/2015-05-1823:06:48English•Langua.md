=====================================

As shown in the screenshot, the language filter is ineffective.\
In the screenshot, I specify to only retrieve English documents, but
German results remain abundant. Maybe this is intended?\
\
In case it may be useful, I wrote an excellent language detector in
javascript able to recognize languages even for very short texts with
just 5รท10 words. It is currently capable to distinguish and tell
English, Spanish, French ,Italian, German and Russian.\
\
Available here, from within a firefox add-on package of mine:
[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefo \...
xt-reader/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/automatik-text-reader/){.postlink}\
Just to show the quality of the alghorithm, a video example of the
recognition is here: <https://vimeo.com/113796496>\
