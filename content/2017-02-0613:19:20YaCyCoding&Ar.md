YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Privacy and Referer http header
============================================================

Date: 2017-02-06 13:19:20

Hi everyone,\
I am sure some YaCy users once opened a browser console and had a look
at the HTTP headers transmitted when opening a search result link. By
the way if you do that you will see that the \'Referer\' header sent to
the visited website contains the full YaCy search URL including request
parameters (at least with default major browsers settings, and except
when your peer is requested with https and the target link is
http\...).\
To my mind it can be quite an issue regarding privacy. Having a look at
other major search engines related strategy, it looks like most of them
redirect their search result links and take the opportunity to fill this
header only with the search engine host name.\
\
What about YaCy? I believe many users are not only concerned by
decentralization but also privacy. So why not set that \"Referer\"
header empty as default for P2P and web portal modes (in Intranet mode
it probably makes sense to let it as it is), and add a configuration
setting for those who still want to send this header filled (some rare
websites may block visitors with an empty Referer header).\
\
Technically I propose to add a [\"rel=\'noreferrer\'\"
attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#link-type-noreferrer){.postlink}
to search results links in yacysearch.html. Eventually finer settings
will become standard (see W3C [Referer
Policy](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/CR-referrer-policy-20170126/){.postlink}
Candidate Recommendation).\
\
So what do you think about it? Where would you see that new
configuration setting?
