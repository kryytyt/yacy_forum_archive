[![](https://www.jwz.org/images/4cbbbb274.gif)How fitting, I thought,
that a rugged individualist-type would still be running a dial-up only
BBS (no Telnet) out in the middle of
Texas.](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/the-lost-civilization-of-dial-up-bulletin-board-systems/506465/)

> I dialed-in, looked around, and found a bare-bones FidoNet messaging

> FidoNet is the most popular inter-BBS message network, with about
> 2,500 listed nodes (or connected systems) worldwide. That might be a
> stretch; recent attempts to verify that number by actually connecting
> to the services have come far short of 2,500. It\'s more likely that
> 100 to 150 are still active. It\'s a long fall from FidoNet\'s peak in
> 1995, at over 35,000 nodes. \[\...\]

> It was Luther. He spent most of our hour-long conversation talking
> about things like Area 51 and the Mafia. They reflect the colorful
> nature of some of the BBS holdouts. In part of our conversation,
> Luther described the activities of Adolf Hitler and how they related
> to Texas. I had to ask: \"Did Hitler ever use a BBS?\" Luther replied,
> \"I don\'t know.\"

> This veteran sysop was born in 1939 and has been using computers as
> long as he can remember. He says his father once led the math
> department at Texas A&M University, which is located in College
> Station. Today, Luther runs his BBS out of the small house where his
> dad once lived, and he does so out of a sense of obligation to provide
> a dial-up avenue to FidoNet that is \-- supposedly \-- free of
> government surveillance. The BBS as a digital bunker for the age after
> privacy on the internet.
>
> Eventually, Luther expressed grave concern for my safety given his
> complex life full of dangerous connections, so we exchanged polite
> goodbyes. \[\...\]
>
> Ten years ago, when I dipped back into BBSes, I still got a sense that
> many sysops ran them to provide a libertarian alternative to the
> internet. Among them, the unoppressed who wanted religious freedom,
> the unsurveilled who wanted freedom from surveillance, and those
> prepping for the day when BBSes would provide shelter after the
> internet came crashing down.
>
> Today, those sentiments are much more unusual in the BBS community. In
> 2016, calling a BBS mostly means reliving glory days long past: 1990s
> technology as comfort food, nourishing the fragile soul with a slow
> drip of information at a rate that old-timers actually can comprehend.
