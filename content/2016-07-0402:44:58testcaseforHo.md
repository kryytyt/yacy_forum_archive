test case for HostBalancer issue in intranet mode
with file:// protocol, 2 hostqueues accessing same cache file concurrently

Reason seems to be diff. hosthash key of hostqueues on reopen. 
Internal queue key and external representation (directoryname currently hostname.port) must be adjusted to fix it (not done yet).
