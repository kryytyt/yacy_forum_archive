Hilfe für Einsteiger und Anwender • Re: Tutorial - Monitoring Yacy with Cacti

This tutorial assumes you already have Cacti installed.\
\
As far as I know, Cacti is available in Ubuntu repositories.\
\
After installing it, you should also install cacti-spine, which is an
upgrade to Cacti\'s default poller (poller.php). Spine is in C and it\'s
much faster. Depending on the number of cpe\'s you\'re monitoring, as
well as the poller cycle, spine turns out to be a must have.\
\
If you\'re new to Cacti, it\'s highly recommended that you try to
produce a basic graph (for example, cpu usage), one of the few bundled
ones, before trying to produce the ones shown in the tutorial.\
\
In that case, you probably need to install snmp, since those bundled
grpahs use snmp as their data input method.\
\
By producing a standard graph, you will validate your installation and
make sure everything is ok.
