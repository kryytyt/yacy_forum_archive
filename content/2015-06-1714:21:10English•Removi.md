English â€¢ Removing duplicates from results using fuzzy\_signature\_uniqu
========================================================================

Date: 2015-06-17 14:21:10

I am having difficulty removing duplicates from results using the
fuzzy\_signature\_unique\_b attribute.\
I have put fuzzy\_signature\_unique\_b:true in the Filter Query and the
duplicates still appear.\
I further examined the metadata for the duplicates and found that even
the fuzzy\_signature\_l was the same for multiple results, the
fuzzy\_signature\_unique\_b was set to true in all cases. I think that
fuzzy\_signature\_unique\_b should be set to true only for the first
instance that fuzzy\_signature\_l was unique. On subsequent loads, the
fuzzy\_signature\_unique\_b value should be set to false.\
Is my logic correct or am I misinterpreting something?\
I am using YACY on an Intranet for a private search so I am unable to
provide links though I would be able to provide more data.\
I am new to YACY and am very pleased with the results with the exception
of the duplicates.\
Thank you in advance for any insight that you may provide.\

Regards,\
