English â€¢ Re: YaCy version 1.81/9116 knocks servers off Adressing
=================================================================

Application Level Failure\
Independent Fault Testing Results\
\
We have consulted extensively with the cloud provider which has done
extensive testing.\
We suspected this was shared firewall related.\
\
Remembering our servers are Robinson servers that read each other for
search results but do not write to each other,\...\
And that the clouds are logically and geographically physically
separated from each other though accessible to each other in read only
mode, through multiple level 3 carrier pipes belonging to the same
leading European facilities based carrier and provider.\
Our theory was that the YaCy servers could not communicate with each
other to get data on every search - and that this could block the
results from being displayed.\
\
We thought that the message\

> <div>
>
> \
> The peer must go online to get a peer address.\
>
> </div>

\
on Status.html?noforward= was indicating a cascade of errors caused by
the servers being unable to find their previous IP addresses when patch
version 1.81/9116 was applied to both servers, consecutively.\
We still believe this is the case.\
\
We further believe that the 500 Type Error pages for certain
Administration functions is probably caused by the servers not being
able to find their own previously known IP addresses, and this in turn,
generates the errors manifested by 500 Type Error pages shown in the
administration of each server. We note the faulty pages with 500 Type
Errors are identical on both servers - that both received the 1.81/9116
update within minutes of each other, though consecutively.\
\
[However, we suspected this was shared firewall related - where a
firewall key setting was potentially damaged.\
We have discovered that the fault is not in the
firewalls.]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
\
At our request, the cloud provider (yesterday) did independent internal
examination & testing on both clouds - specifically examining the shared
firewall environment related to the hypervisor configurations.\
\
Results of their internal testing.\
1) Port 8090 is indeed OPEN and listening on both clouds.\
2) Internet access is unrestricted at their virtual rack level. ( We
noted that our tests showed 8090 OPEN form the outside and we can see
both Admin areas (even if some pages are still showing 500 Errors
(unchanged), as noted previously).\
3) Communications between the clouds is not blocked the cloud provider
has determined\
4) Nothing in the firewalls in either cloud should block the YaCy
servers from speaking with each other to share / cross- read data before
displaying combined results.\
\
We have today applied the currently available patch version version
1.81/9132 to both servers.\
We applied all recommended Ubuntu security and related updates for our
version Ubuntu and have rebooted both from PuTTY and from the cloud
provider interface.\
The previous error state and error pages remain on both servers, as
before.\
\
Therefore we return to an [[Application Layer
Failure]{style="text-decoration: underline"}]{style="font-weight: bold"}
in YaCy connectivity, dating from an internal mis-configuration caused
when patch YaCy version 1.81/9116 was applied to both servers,
consecutively.\
\
[Can someone please tell us how to\
1) restore connectivity manually and\
2) fix the display of data for searchers so that search results are
shown again - and not just the framework at the top of the display page,
and\
3) reconnect the admin screens such as they remove the 500 Errors,
please?\
\
As noted previously, it is our hunch that restoring the IP address
connectivity will remove the other errors - though we did not
participate in the engine\'s development, so we really do not know if
this is \'the simple fix\' that we are seeking to all three problems.
This seems to be the unanticipated error state and hence indication that
we need to resolve. ]{style="font-weight: bold"}

Thank you very kindly and have a nice day.
