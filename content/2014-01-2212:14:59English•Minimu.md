English â€¢ Minimum requirements for YaCy
=======================================

Date: 2014-01-22 12:14:59

I have done dedicated server for YaCy to test stability.\
The machine is Athlon64 x2, 2GB RAM, 160GB HDD (Sata) in small factor
Shuttle box. I have installed Debian 7 (stable) on it and I install YaCy
based on [English
wiki](http://www.yacy-websuche.de/wiki/index.php/En:DebianInstall){.postlink}.
Also, I have redirected port on my router to it to make it visible from
outside. Also I have enabled network crawling.\
\
I have discovered that after just few hours my YaCy site is not
accessible at all.\
\
Do I made something wrong?\
Apart of network access for YaCy, I don\'t change any memory settings,
system is completely clear, nothing else installed on it\...
