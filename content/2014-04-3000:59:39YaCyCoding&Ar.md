I have started working on an API and I have just commited my code to the
git repository. I have onyl implemented some very basic things so far
and I have only implemented them for XML so far. I used the existing
APIs for inspiration.\
\
Get a list of all blacklists:\
<http://localhost:8090/api/blacklists/get_metadata_p.xml>\
\
Get a specific blacklist:\
<http://localhost:8090/api/blacklists/get_list_p.xml?name=url.default.black>\
\
Add a new entry to a blacklist:\
<http://localhost:8090/api/blacklists/add_entry_p.xml?blacklist=url.default.black&entry=.example.org/shop/.*>\
\
Delete an entry from a blacklist:\
<http://localhost:8090/api/blacklists/delete_entry_p.xml?blacklist=url.default.black&entry=.example.org/shop/.*>\
\
Does this look OK for a start? I\'ll try to create a WIki page as quick
as possible, but for now I have to quit and get some sleep.\
\
edit: Just noticed an inconsitency in the naming: \"name\" and
\"blacklist\" is the same thing with two different names. I will fix
that tomorrow.
