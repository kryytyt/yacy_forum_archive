=====================================================================

With YaCy you can create secret search agents which do searches for you
automatically within your own search index. That index can be filled
automatically with rss feeds and a search within your own index, sorted
by date can be retrieved using rss feeds again. In combination with an
rss feed reader, reading search results from your own index, you get
secret search agents which are fully private because the search requests
never leave your own computer.\
