> Once set up correctly it will hover above the base for as long as it
> is powered, displaying the time and date on digits of glowing metal
> and glass. Needing no batteries, the nixie clock is powered from the
> base without wires and will operate without interruption for months or
> years. No charging is required, it just floats and works.
