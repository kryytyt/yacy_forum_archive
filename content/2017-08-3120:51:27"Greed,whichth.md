> The major social media sites have been making some weak, token efforts

> In an article about alternative social media, there\'s a hint. The

> trash of the internet, are getting worried about the few examples of
> evicted Nazis, and so are building their own new brands: a chat
> network called Gab, and there\'s something that is an alternative to
> Patreon that is, amusingly, openly called Hatreon, for people who want
> to get paid for hating. If you\'re wondering why American companies

> But why? Why would American computer programmers drift towards

> They don\'t care about race or gender. That usually means they don\'t

> noticing that they\'re soaking in a particularly ugly ideology.
