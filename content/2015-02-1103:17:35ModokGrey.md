> He floats toward me, the metal carapace necessary to prevent his
> enormous head from crushing the rest of his tiny little skeleton
> pushing me against the wall of the elevator. Before I know it, he\'s
> got both of my hands in a vice-like grip above my head with a
> retractable clamp I didn\'t see him deploy and he\'s pinning me to the
> wall using his shriveled legs. Holy shit. Another appendage - it is
> becoming apparent that his suit contains many - grabs my ponytail and
> yanks down, bringing my face up, and his gigantic lips are on mine.
> It\'s only just not painful. I moan into his mouth, which encompasses
> most of my head now, giving his tongue an opening. He takes full
> advantage, the very tip of his skateboard-sized tongue swiping back
> and forth across my mouth. I have never been kissed like this.
>
> My tongue tentatively strokes his and joins his in a slow erotic dance
> that\'s all about touch and sensation, all bump and grind, like I\'m
> vainly licking a damp comforter that someone is swirling around my
> entire head. He brings a many-segmented exoskeletal appendage up to
> grasp my chin and holds me in place. I am helpless, my hands pinned,
> my face held, and his little bitty legs bracketing my hips. I feel the
> industrial-grade titanium of his armor against my belly. Oh my\... He
> wants me. MODOK, howling-mad super-genius, wants me, and I want him,
> here\... now, in the elevator, if it is even possible to access his
> erogenous zones while he is encased in metal and bristling with
> weaponry.
>
> \"You. Are. So. Sweet. You. Inferior. Mental. Gnat,\" he shouts in my
> face, each word a staccato.
>
> The elevator stops, the doors open, and he bobs away from me in the
> blink of an eye, leaving me hanging and coated from my shoulders to
> the top of my head in saliva.
