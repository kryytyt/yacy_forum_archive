Hilfe für Einsteiger und Anwender • Global Crawl
================================================

Date: 2014-02-22 14:34:52

Hello!\
\
I\'ve got my new odroid 03 set up and yacy is up and running. I\'ve got
a terabyte external harddrive attached and I\'m all good to go.\
\
Is there a large ongoing global crawl I can join? I\'m having trouble
finding anything in the documentation. I know I can put in a website
address and start a local crawl which other people can access - is this
the only option? I intend to leave my yacy running and I\'d love to be
able to contribute to a bigger crawl.\
\
Let me know what would be best to assist.
