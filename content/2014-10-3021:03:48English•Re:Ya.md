HI and thank you, but unfortunately we installed these by hand in the 2
clouds, so we have this displaying.\

We have since upgraded the two servers to version 1.81/9123 - on both
machines.\
Crawling resumes on the slow server (the other is out of space, so it is
paused)\
\
However, although search requests look like they process, NO Data
Results show\...\
We are using one of the provided templates, at the moment.\
Only the header lines of the results page show with the search term in
the window\
\
Can we have an upgrade/update to fix that, please?\
Many Thanks!
