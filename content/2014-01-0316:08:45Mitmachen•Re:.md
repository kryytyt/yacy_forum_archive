\"One\" may can help will test it with the next YaCy-Update for Debian
when its included thank you.\
\"Two\" probably won\'t help in that case because stunnel takes the
request at Port 443 and delivers it to the standard HTTP-Port thats in
that case 8090. I don\'t use the ssl-functionality thats build right
into yacy itself.
