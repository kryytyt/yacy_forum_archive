HDMI audio prevents screen saver
================================

Is there a long German word for: \"You Google a problem, and the only
results are you asking about it the last time you ran into it\"?

Because that happens to me a lot.

Anyway, MacOS 10.11 still has the ridiculous bug that if your system
audio output is set to HDMI, and iTunes is playing, then the screen
saver will never activate and your screen will never lock. I fixed this
[once
before](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/03/hdmi-audio-prevents-screen-saver/),
but the procedure has gotten more complicated because now certain system
files can\'t be modified even by root. So now the new recipe is:

1.  Gently apply the Stick of Correction to a copy of the binary:

    `sudo -s mkdir -p /usr/local/sbin cp -p /usr/sbin/coreaudiod \       /usr/local/sbin/coreaudiod.hacked perl -pi \   -e 's/N(oDisplaySleepAssertion)/_$1/g;' \   -e 's/P(reventUserIdleDisplaySleep)/_$1/g;' \   /usr/local/sbin/coreaudiod.hacked codesign -vfs 'Your Name' \   /usr/local/sbin/coreaudiod.hacked`

2.  Boot in \"Recovery Mode\" (Cmd-R), and in \"Utilities / Terminal\",
    type:

    `csrutil disable`

3.  Boot in \"Standalone Mode\" (Cmd-S), and type:

    `mount -uw / rm /usr/sbin/coreaudiod ln -s /usr/local/sbin/coreaudiod.hacked \       /usr/sbin/coreaudiod`

4.  Boot in \"Recovery Mode\" (Cmd-R), and in \"Utilities / Terminal\",
    undo what you did the first time:

    `csrutil enable`

5.  Third reboot, and you\'re done. *EASY.*
