[Riding Light:](https://www.vimeo.com/117815404)

> In our terrestrial view of things, the speed of light seems incredibly
> fast. But as soon as you view it against the vast distances of the
> universe, it\'s unfortunately very slow. This animation illustrates,
> in realtime, the journey of a photon of light emitted from the surface
> of the sun and traveling across a portion of the solar system, from a
> human perspective.
>
> I\'ve taken liberties with certain things like the alignment of
> planets and asteroids, as well as ignoring the laws of relativity
> concerning what a photon actually \"sees\" or how time is experienced
> at the speed of light, but overall I\'ve kept the size and distances
> of all the objects as accurate as possible. I also decided to end the
> animation just past Jupiter as I wanted to keep the running length
> below an hour.
