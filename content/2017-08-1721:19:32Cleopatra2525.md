[![](https://www.jwz.org/images/cleopatra2525c.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2ZRSwul7cE)I
just rewatched *Cleopatra 2525* and I\'m here to tell you that it\'s
still awesome.

It\'s Kung-Fu *Barbarella.* So much wire-fighting. So much *Cyberdog.*
Floating shape-shifting robots have chased humanity underground,
occasionally attacking with T-1000s with blaster arms. Everyone has
Spider-Man web-shooters, and there\'s an evil clown. It\'s got
everything! But the thing that makes it work is that it\'s a comedy but
almost every character in it fully commits to being in an action movie.
They are So Very Serious.

It does, however, have a theme song that is possibly worse than
*Enterprise*. Don\'t let that put you off.

It ends on an extremely frustrating cliffhanger and a final episode that
seems to have stopped production halfway through. Yet *Arrow* gets six
seasons. I would trade the entirety of *Game of Thrones* for one more
season of *Cleopatra 2525.*

watch. It looks like the whole thing is on Youtube too, but in varying
quality.
