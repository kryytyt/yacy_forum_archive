Your favorite 2-piece keyboard. Go.
===================================

![](http://www.jwz.org/images/img_1738.jpg)The Kinesis Freestyle2 is a
reasonable shape, but the keys are mushy. Rubber domes, I assume,
instead of springs.

By \"2-piece\" I mean QWERTY where the left and right side are
physically separated and movable, not connected permanently at a fixed
distance or angle.

Kits need not apply. No, I don\'t want to solder my own.
