you actually got the right idea, limitation of RAM must mean that the
index + document size is limited as well and that means the oldest data
must be deleted if fresh data is wanted.\
\
Well this is actually comlex in many ways: first, people will be scared
by the idea that YaCy deletes on itself. second: deletion does not mean
that immediately memory is free because that needs an optimization step
as well and that should be done not too frequently; its complex.\
And of course, that should not be switched on by default.
