I guess a daily mean of 180 PPM, peaking at 500 with load of 6 on 4
cores.\
Running at 200 PPM the load is about 2รท2,5, with most of it being disk
IO latency (CPU wait time).\
\
[EDIT:]{style="font-weight: bold"} BTW, I would try to further lower
your VM memory, maybe to 4 GB, just to have a valid comparison and see
if the load decreases. In case, you might consider using a different
java VM with better CG.\
\
Also, check what makes up the load. It might just be IO latency.
