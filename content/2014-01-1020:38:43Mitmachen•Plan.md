Mitmachen â€¢ Planning for a good test environment
================================================

Planning:\
\
Since yesterday, I think about a better [test
environment]{style="font-weight: bold"} for reproduce-able results:\
\
At work ( I work in a government research centre of Germany) I would
have a Workstation what can simulate some web servers. This PC has a
second Ethernet interface. So I could prepare a small closed network
together with CubieTrucks and RasPis. With no other network traffic as
that what YaCy produces.\
\
But to prepare my workstation I need big test-web-sites with a lot of
content what YaCy can crawl. [Do anybody know if such test-web-sites are
prepared for downloading?]{style="font-weight: bold"} I could crawl and
download some web sites like wikibooks.org or wikipedia.org. But, at
first It would produce senseless traffic for this sites and this is not
really effective as a download of a prepared web-site for such test
purposes.\
\
[The second way: We would find YaCy users which operate with an own web
site and YaCy as search engine. Maybe such an user could pack an image
of his web site for such tests.]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
\
Do anybody can help or do anybody knows persons which can help to give
an image of such a big test-web-site?\
\
Best regards, Frank!
