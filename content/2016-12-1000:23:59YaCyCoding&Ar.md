Ok, if it works run a test on any site but the on in question to become
familiar with Yacy.\
Change the mode to Webportal and untick \"Configure your router for YaCy
for PnP\"\
Run another crawl (advanced) and learn how to use it.\
Then Use Index Import Export and determine which type of data you need.
I use \"Fulltext of Search Index Text\", most times and depends what I
want to see and process.\
\
If you can get a spare box specs P3 3GHz HT with 1 GB of memory it is
possible to run Yacy headless eg no desktop interface on Debian 8.5 32
bit but crawling will be slow.\
Debian 8.5 as a headless server has a memory foot print \~ 88 MB after
startup.
