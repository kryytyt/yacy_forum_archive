> Mitch McConnell, prince of dust, took his current form on February 20,
> 1942, molded of a strange flesh, his mouth open and already seeking.
>
> Mitch McConnell, for whom the ghouls slaver, spent his childhood
> crushing spiders in paper napkins and stuffing them into his mouth,
> one after the other, and never was he seen to expel them at all.
>
> Mitch McConnell, who waits in the gravel pit, attended high school in
> Georgia, where he sat with the cobwebs and giggled, and would not say
> where all the town\'s dogs had gone.
>
> Mitch McConnell, possessor of a human smile, frequently took it out of
> its jar to woo his wives. They would admire it, play with it, but only
> Sherrill asked where it had come from. Elaine does not care.
>
> Mitch McConnell, lord of misrule, moved to Kentucky in a single night.
> Those houses he passed sickened, and lie even now, windowless, in
> gardens of ash.
>
> Mitch McConnell, whose handshake is like grasping an ankle, ran for
> the senate in 1984. He performs no real function there. He only sits
> in his office and smells the women walking by, even up to three miles
> away.
>
> Mitch McConnell, weaver of cartilage, has three children. Nothing is
> known of them. He has three children. He has three children, all his
> own. He has three children. You mustn\'t touch them, those three
> children.
>
> Mitch McConnell, beloved of frogs, is always facing you. The longer he
> watches you the more sweat you see on his face. But he says nothing.
> There is a pulse in his chin. And still he says nothing. Mitch
> McConnell, priest of the unshriven, gnaws upon cotton during votes,
> which he tallies with rows of dead flies. His colleagues know to leave
> immediately after voting, or, grinning, he will force them to eat
> their tally mark.

> McConnell, the dampness between the toes, knows intimately the taste
> of stone. When in his confusion he takes hold of your shoulder and
> feels your bones, he only wants to know that taste again. When his

> Mitch McConnell, whose inward parts are wet cardboard, does not
> understand the sun. He sees it from his window each day and vows anew
> to destroy it. His children assure him he can, and then he smiles and
> kisses their tough, soft faces like old earlobes.
>
> Mitch McConnell, licker of shrouds, believes in God. He feels he must,
> for people cry out to Them so often in his presence that it is best to
> assume God is there somewhere. And it is also best to stop that
> crying, but then he must in turn stop the struggling, but then
>
> Mitch McConnell, whose true name is a worn tooth, tells his
> cartilaginous children that corporations are people. And his children
> agree, and he smiles and kisses their foreheads, where after all these
> years the slime of their creation is still wet.
>
> Mitch McConnell, drinker of vipers, is not a scientist. He distrusts
> them, in fact. They know too much. They might know about HIM. So he
> chews on some red ragged thing and makes a plan he will forget by
> daylight.
>
> Mitch McConnell, whose tongue is far too sleek, has a gun. He kisses
> it every noon and calls it by Elaine\'s name. His children smile and
> kiss it as well, with their lips like tendons. Mitch wants everyone to
> have an Elaine to love.
>
> Mitch McConnell, whose breath smells of hawthorn, loves his children.
> One day he will love them so much they will crawl back into his mouth
> & nestle there. And then so will we, smiling & free from sin. He loves
> us. He forgives us. One day we\'ll understand. He looks forward to it.
