> Your computer automatically trusts every device you plug into it. But
> every USB device is actually a small embedded computer that runs
> software you cannot control.
>
> USB driver exploits work by sending malformed or unexpected input to
> your computer\'s USB drivers. Your computer likely has hundreds of USB
> device drivers installed, and a programming error in any one of them
> leaves you exposed.
>
> The USG blocks these attacks by passing data through an internal
> serial link with a very simple protocol. Only a limited number of safe
> commands are accepted by the receiving microprocessor, so no malformed
> or unexpected data is transmitted to your computer. This effectively
> blocks USB driver exploits.
