Hilfe für Einsteiger und Anwender • Recovery from crash
=======================================================

Hello,\
\
Sorry invading the deutsch forum with an english request for help, but
my previous post
(<http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5211>) on the
english forum didn\'t get any reply.\
\
My problem is that while running 24x7 Yacy 1.7 for GNU/Linux over an
Ubuntu Server 14.04, whenever the server goes down due to a power
outage, Yacy doesn\'t restart.\
\
I found out that the computer crash always corrupts the file Yacy.conf,
leaving an empty file as result, thus preventing startYACY from
executing.\
\
A possible workaround is to backup Yacy.conf and to have a startup
script that tests if it is empty and have it restored, before calling
startYACY.sh. I have already implemented this and it works.\
\
There is only a small issue (I guess) with restoring Yacy.conf that way:
whenever I hover the mouse over the Monitoring section of the left
vertical column, I get the message \"[You did not yet start a web crawl!
You do not see all monitoring options here, because some belong to crawl
results monitoring. Start a web crawl to see
that]{style="font-style: italic"}.\", which is false, because I had
already started crawls.\
\
So, my questions is: Is my Yacy.conf restoring procedure correct, or
should I backup/restore other files and eventually take other steps
before calling startYACY.sh?
