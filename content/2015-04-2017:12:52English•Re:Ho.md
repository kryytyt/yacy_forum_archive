Hi\
\
I see that this thread is quite old , but I don\'t see any solution
posted\...\
\
If you can access to machine locally (or with ssh) [you can manually
change the configuration file yacy.conf]{style="font-weight: bold"} with
a text editor\
in this file you can looking for
[isTransparentproxy=false]{style="font-weight: bold"}, then change in
true\
\
for the part of:\

> <div>
>
> \
> I solved this error by going to /Settings\_p.html?page=ServerAccess
> and setting the staticIP to the external IP instead of the IP address
> behind the firewall.\
>
> </div>

\
\
in yacy.conf you can also edit :[ StaticIP=]{style="font-weight: bold"}\
and fill it manually.\
\
after editing you need to restar yacy\
Cheers to all!
