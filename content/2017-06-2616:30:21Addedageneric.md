Added a generic XML parser, able to parse elements text and URLs.

This parser adds support for any XML based format other than already
supported XML vocabularies such XHTML, RSS/Atom feeds... It will
eventually be used as a fallback if one of these specific parsers fail,
before falling back to the existing genericParser which extracts not
that much useful information except URL tokens.
