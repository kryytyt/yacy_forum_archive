\"Smart\" quotes are a pox upon the face of the Earth
=====================================================

My least favorite byte is `0x00`, for [obvious
reasons](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/04/heartbleed-hit-list/),
followed closely by `0x11` and `0x13`, for [other obvious
reasons](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/11/termaaa60-mk-2/), but really,
I\'m developeing a deep, abiding, years-long hatred for the sequences
`0xE28098`, `0xE28099`, `0xE2809C`, `0xE2809D` and their fancy pirate
names `\u2018`, `\u2019`, `\u201C` and `\u201D`.

When I type a god damned double-quote, you know what I want to appear? A
god damned double-quote, a single-ducking-byte `0x22` thank you very god
damned much. If I wanted some Unicrud up in this shit, I\'d have ducking
typed it. Did I stutter?

So because we (or at least I) still live in a world where HTML is a
thing that one must occasionally actually *type* by *hand* (like an
*animal*) and because the iOS on-screen keyboard is a monstrous horror
that makes that (to be generous) *extremely* annoying, I have a few
keyboard shortcuts, such as

::: {style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 300px;"}
![](https://www.jwz.org/images/2017/smrt_quts_1.png){sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 72em"
srcset="https://www.jwz.org/images/2017/smrt_quts_1.png 637w, https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/360/2017/smrt_quts_1.png 360w"}

That used to do what it said. See those straight up-and-down quotes
there? Yeah, that\'s what I typed. I ducking typed that. But guess what!
After the latest iOS upgrade, when I type `ahref`, what gets inserted?
Waaaait for it\...

::: {style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 300px;"}
![](https://www.jwz.org/images/2017/smrt_quts_2.png){sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 72em"
srcset="https://www.jwz.org/images/2017/smrt_quts_2.png 594w, https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/360/2017/smrt_quts_2.png 360w"}

Ooooh, *curly!!* Sure, that\'s close enough to what I meant. You know,
except for the part where it doesn\'t actually work at all.

Even when you try to type an actual quote on the keyboard, you have to
jump through an extra hold-and-pull-down-the-key hoop:

::: {style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 300px;"}
![](https://www.jwz.org/images/2017/smrt_quts_3.png){sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 72em"
srcset="https://www.jwz.org/images/2017/smrt_quts_3.png 629w, https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/360/2017/smrt_quts_3.png 360w"}

I\'m surprised \-- no really, I\'m actually surprised \-- that it\'s not
also turning my hyphens into one of Unicrud\'s Nine Billion Alternate
Names For Horizontal Obsolescent Latin En Dash.

And then of course WordPress spreads an extra layer of creamy turd on
top of the whole sundae. Here are only the *things I\'ve discovered so
far* to make WordPress leave your god damned characters alone. I\'m sure
there are more lurking, and more sneak in with every release:

> `remove_filter ('the_content', 'wpautop'); remove_action ('admin_print_styles', 'print_emoji_styles'); remove_action ('wp_head', 'print_emoji_detection_script', 7); remove_action ('admin_print_scripts', 'print_emoji_detection_script'); remove_action ('wp_print_styles', 'print_emoji_styles'); remove_filter ('wp_mail', 'wp_staticize_emoji_for_email'); remove_filter ('the_content_feed', 'wp_staticize_emoji'); remove_filter ('comment_text_rss', 'wp_staticize_emoji'); add_filter ('emoji_svg_url', '__return_false');`{style="font-size:smaller"}

What the hell is wrong with you people. I can\'t even.
