Hi,\
i looked upon this, just to figure how to scrape twitter. It is possible
to scrape twitter via their api, but they have limitations regarding
twitter api (terms of service + query restrictions).\
\
There are few do-able solutions:\
1)Scrape Twitter streaming JSON API and receive all tweets\*, parse it
with suitable already existing applications which can turn it to RSS,
which yacy can read directly.\
2)Same as above but use twitter json/api compatible java library and
integrate it to yacy.\*\
\
\*You receive only \~1% of the tweets per token with streaming api, also
theres restrictions what you can do with the data.Its quite easy to do
the choice one, but i don\'t know how it will look in search results.\
I dont have enough knowledge in programming to do option 2 at this time
but flip side, this would be excellent programming experience + learning
opportunity.\
\
Of course it would be nice in some cases but also extremely creepy to
make social search into yacy which would build social profile for every
people based on crawling, like showing profile pictures, all social
media accounts and other information like friends etc.
