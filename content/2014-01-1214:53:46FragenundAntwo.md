Fragen und Antworten â€¢ YaCy in BOINC environment
================================================

Date: 2014-01-12 14:53:46

Hi,\
\
I\'m currently involved in few BOINC based projects and would like to
use YaCy as client application for one of it, but there is few
problems.\
I would like to create virtual machine with (let\'s say) 5GB of space
and distribute it to min. 500-800 users and more than 1000 computers.
Unfortunately, YaCy require port forwarded to it.\
I know, that I can use proxy for it - but how to do it?\
Also, 5GB is not a large space for index - so the question is if it will
be useful for YaCy network?\
Other solution possible is to fork YaCy as BOINC client application, but
I don\'t have enough knowledge to do it\...\
\
Anyway. It will be very helpfully to create English section on forum, as
most users don\'t speak German\...
