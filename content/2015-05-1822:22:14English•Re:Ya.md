My pstree looks much the same; when I talked about the multiple
processes, I thought of the \'81\' number you show. My mistake it seems,
is this second number the number of threads?\
\
[EDIT]{style="font-weight: bold"}:\
\'man pstree\' says it all :\
\"Child threads of a process are found under the parent process and are
shown with the process name in curly braces, e.g.\
icecast2\-\--13\*\[{icecast2}\]\
\"\
\
sorry for my lack of precision in terming the issue
