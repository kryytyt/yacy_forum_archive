[SFMTA removed safety infrastructure on Folsom St. and they need an
email from
you!](http://www.sfmtra.org/blog/2016/10/26/the-sfmta-removed-safety-infrastructure-on-folsom-st-and-they-need-an-email-from-you)

> Within hours of our work being featured on the front page of the
> Chronicle, the SFMTA removed posts on Folsom at Division that
> protected cyclists at a busy intersection for weeks. To add insult to
> injury, the SFMTA worker blocked the bike lane with his truck while
> removing our posts.
>
> Over the past few weeks, SFMTA has prioritized removing our safety
> infrastructure over adding new infrastructure. They\'ve removed safety
> features on Crossover, Geary, Valencia, Scott, and now Folsom. Sadly,
> just yesterday a cyclist was hit in the Valencia bike lane and was
> hospitalized. It is clear that the organization in charge of San
> Francisco street safety doesn\'t take the welfare of our cyclists and
> pedestrians seriously.
>
> Please email the city leaders we\'ve listed below. Feel free to use
> our template or write your own message. We want the city to know that
> (1) the posts on Folsom made you more safe (2) you want those posts to
> be replaced with something as good or better, and (3) that you demand
> immediate safety improvements while long term street transformations
> are developed.
