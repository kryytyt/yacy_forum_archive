What happened to SpamAssassin?
==============================

Date: 2017-12-13 20:06:54

For the last few weeks, `sa-update` says \"channel: no
\'mirrors.updates.spamassassin.org\' record found, channel failed\",
presumably because neither that nor updates.spamassassin.org resolve.

Also apparently all the SARE rulesets are gone?
