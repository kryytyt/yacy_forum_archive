YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ Java 8 to support Solr 6.6
=======================================================

Date: 2017-06-09 11:55:06

It's now time to do the migration to Java 1.8.\
\
Deployment is difficult if all systems are already running Java 8 and it
is required to install Java 7 to ensure that a deployment is also
actually supporting Java 7.\
I also had massive issues with Solr on the demo-Server at
yacy.searchlab.eu. I hope this gets better with Solr 6.6\
But Since Solr 6.0, a Java 1.8 is required.\
\
Migration of the Solr index from 5.5 to 6.6 will happen automatically.
It will not be possible to migrate a Solr Index 4.x to 6.6 but that
should not be an issue. Everyone who has still a very old YaCy and wants
to migrate, just migrate first to YaCy 1.92 and everything will be
fine.\
\
Please spread the news that everyone should now install Java 8.
