Work](https://aeon.co/essays/what-if-jobs-are-not-the-solution-but-the-problem?s=MH).

Money Quote:

> When I see, for example, that you're making millions by laundering
> drug-cartel money (HSBC), or pushing bad paper on mutual fund managers
> (AIG, Bear Stearns, Morgan Stanley, Citibank), or preying on
> low-income borrowers (Bank of America), or buying votes in Congress
> (all of the above) -- just business as usual on Wall Street -- while
> I'm barely making ends meet from the earnings of my full-time job, I
> realise that my participation in the labour market is irrational. I
> know that building my character through work is stupid because crime
> pays. I might as well become a gangster like you.
