Please enjoy [jwz mixtape
174](https://www.dnalounge.com/webcast/mixtapes/).

Dear music video directors:

For whatever reason, you have decided to shoot your video in 2:35:1
anamorphic widescreen. And then you uploaded it to Youtube as a
1920x1080 video, with 124 pixel tall black letterbox bars at the top and
the bottom, burned right into the video. *WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT??*

People do this all the time and it makes no goddamned sense. The MP4
format, Youtube and every video player in the world all support videos
of arbitrary even heights. Even worse is when they decide to be all
retro and 80s and shoot in 4:3 with VHS filters on top, but they still
pillarbox it out to 16:9. Double-you tee fuck.

You don\'t know what shape my screen is. Don\'t judge me.

Oh, and in \"Youtube just gets worse every day\" news: Youtube no longer
allows me to favorite videos, because \"Favorites\", though special, are
still just implemented as a
[playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=FLBKC3Bi_ckdOm3HxPRB98LQ),
and playlists have a maximum of 5,000 entries. Because who would like
more things than that? 5,000 favorites should be enough for anybody.
