[Sewer Snake: Boss
Level](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/apr/21/huge-10-ton-fatberg-removed-chelsea-sewer-london)

> A 10-tonne lump of wet wipes and fat has been removed from a sewer in
> Chelsea, west London.
>
> The toxic lump of congealed fat and household waste \-- known as a
> fatberg \-- was 40 metres long and so heavy that it broke the
> 1940s-era sewer.
>
> Repairing the damaged sewer is expected to cost Thames Water Â£400,000
> and take more than two months, the company said.
>
> Stephen Hunt, a repair and maintenance supervisor at Thames Water, who
> is overseeing the fatberg\'s removal, said its size was staggering.
>
> \"We see blockages all the time on household sewer pipes, which are
> about big enough for a cricket ball to pass through, but to have this
> much damage on a sewer almost a metre in diameter is mind-boggling.
>
> \"The original sewer has been so badly abused by fat being chucked
> down the plughole we\'ve had to opt for the time-consuming and
> disruptive option of replacing many metres of pipe.\"
