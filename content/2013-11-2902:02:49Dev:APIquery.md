== The Query Servlet ==\
\
The servlet at /yacy/query.html performs mainly the purpose as a
back-ping access point. When a \[\[Dev:APIhello\|peer-ping\]\] is done,
the ping\'ed peer tries to call this query servlet to explore if the
pinging peer has an open server port.\
\
=== Properties in the callers http header ===\
The caller must obey the \[\[Dev:APIHttpHeader\|http header rules\]\].\
\
=== Operations performed when the servlet is called ===\
The server retries the requested information from the database.\
There is also a client network verification which is done by checking if
the client has the necessary knowledge about the network position of the
called peer. To prove this, the caller must know the called peers hash.
This value must be passed in the \'youare\' field.\
\
=== Properties in the callers http post-arguments ===\
Calls to the servlet is made using a POST operation. The properties
are:\
\* youare=\<the peer-hash of the called peer\>\
\* object=\<name of the object that is queried\>, the possible values
are:\
\*\* rwiurlcount; the optional parameter \'env\' must contain the rwi
term hash\
\*\* rwicount\
\* env=\<optional parameter\>\
\
=== Result Properties ===\
The returned document contains a list of property lines. These
properties are:\
\* version=\<YaCy version number of responding peer\>\
\* uptime=\<time the responding peer is running since startup in
minutes\>\
\* mytime=\<the local time of the responding peer in format
yyyyMMddHHmmss\>\
\* response=\<the response to the request\>\
\
=== Example Usage ===\
When testing this feature against the own peer, the peer hash of the own
peer must be known. This is easily retrieved by calling the
\[\[Dev:APINetwork\|/Network.xml\]\] servlet which provides the own peer
hash in the \'hash\' property.\
Consider your own peer hash is \'2k7n3rHbdDTf\', then an example url
would be\
http://localhost:8090/yacy/query.html?object=rwicount&youare=2k7n3rHbdDTf\
which may return something like this:\
version=0.1\
uptime=1\
response=29663\
mytime=20131129004804
