Also operating on the \"badge of honor\" principle are the buttons
general to every kinds of politics, from nationwide elections to class
president. Again, like signage, these buttons serve to more of a purpose
of labeling existing believers in the brand as well as using them as
walking free advertising rather than trying to win on over new clients
through giving them a useful promotional item they\'ll take to their
cubicle at work. The now-popular and famous lapel pins are the same
thing, too. There are some pretty wasteful political promotional items,
too.\
