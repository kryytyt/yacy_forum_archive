> It\'s a common enough scenario. You\'re in your twenties or thirties,
> holding down a steady job. You\'re getting by, if not getting rich.
> You\'ve put a little money away, but you wonder, Will it be enough?
> Simultaneously, you keep hearing whispers that the all-powerful Amulet
> of Nargoth, Necromancer King, was not destroyed in the Molten Swamp,
> as previously believed, but rather endures, infused with the power to
> satisfy every desire of the one who carries it . . . should he survive
> the battery of tests set by Nargoth.
>
> **What does retirement look like to you?** The quality of life you
> expect for your golden years will dictate the work needed to achieve
> it. Do you imagine frequent travel? A second home? Ruling from a
> throne carved of pure amethyst, flanked by diamantine mountains that
> obscure the sun, and never again filling out a 401(k)-contribution
> form? Knowing your expectations will help you avoid disappointment
> later on.
