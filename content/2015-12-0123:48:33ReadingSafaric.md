Reading Safari cookies from Perl
================================

Date: 2015-12-01 23:48:33

Did the Perl / Core Foundation bridging break in MacOS 10.11? This used
to work:

> `use Foundation; my $e = NSHTTPCookieStorage->sharedHTTPCookieStorage->cookies->objectEnumerator; while (my $c = $e->nextObject and $$c) { Â  print $c->domain->cString . ": " . $c->value->cString . "\n"; }`

But now:

> Can\'t locate object method \"sharedHTTPCookieStorage\" via package
> \"NSHTTPCookieStorage\" (perhaps you forgot to load
> \"NSHTTPCookieStorage\"?)
