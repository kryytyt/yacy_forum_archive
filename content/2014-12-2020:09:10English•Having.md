English â€¢ Having trouble with port forwarding
=============================================

Date: 2014-12-20 20:09:10

Hello, I would very much like to contribute my index to the network, but
I am having trouble with port forwarding.\
\
I\'m running Yacy 1.8/9000 on a Macintosh with Yosemite connected to the
Internet through a wire. My ISP is Cablevision/Optimum Online.\
\
I have opened both ports 8090 and 8443 on my router, and I\'ve tested
that they\'re open using the Network Utility in OS X, but Yacy still
says that my peer can\'t be reached from the outside. I\'ve tried
restarting Yacy several times, without success.\
\
I\'ve also tried opening different ports, 9090 and 9443, both of which I
also tested with network utility, with no effect. (Of course, I also
changed the ports Yacy looks for in the administration menus.)\
\
My ISP blocks both ports 80 and 25, but I have a feeling that isn\'t the
problem. Optimum Online does give the option of opening these ports, and
so I opened port 80, again with no effect.\
\
Might anyone know what the problem is?
