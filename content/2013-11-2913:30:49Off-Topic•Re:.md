Hello melonius! First of all thank you for translating YaCy!\
\
I just would like to join and extend the discussion. There still is an
English forum (<http://www.yacy-forum.org/>) which is not my forum, but
I try to keep it clean from spam which has become a major task
recently.\
\
When YaCy as a project evolved and it became clear that people outside
of a small circle of developers and early users were interested in the
software, the idea was born that for every language there could be an
extra forum with it\'s own domains and people operating the forums who
are not from the YaCy dev team. (Keeping it decentralized\...)\
\
The English forum was founded a few years ago, but the owner\'s
interests have shifted into other directions. He gave me moderator\'s
permissions, but I don\'t have any access to the server itself which
keeps me from installing updates myself for example. The English forum
is more or less dead, but I think there is a need for an international
forum. I am not sure if we should try to encourage independent forums or
if this forum should have more sections in more languages.
