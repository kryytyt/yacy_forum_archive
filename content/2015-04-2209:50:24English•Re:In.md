Someone has any ideas?\
Have you try to use a post arguments for starting a new crawl? what is
the resoult? Maybe the regular expression, or something else, must be
Url encoded? or maybe the entire post arguments must be url encoded?\
\
\@Orbiter: For be honest, I would do it (updating the wiki) but I don\'t
have even completely undestood the usage of the post arguments API !
Before editing the existing page I Would be sure about what I will have
to write in it
