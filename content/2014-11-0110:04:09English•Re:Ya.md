English â€¢ Re: YaCy version 1.81/9116 knocks servers off Adressing
=================================================================

Application Level\
\
We have consulted extensively with the cloud provider which has done
extensive testing.\
We suspected this was firewall related.\
out Theory was that the YaCy servers could not communicate with each
other to get data on every search - and that this could block the
results from being displayed.\
However, the cloud provider did independent internal testing.\
\
Results of their internal testing.\
1) Port 8090 is OPEN and listening on both clouds.\
2) Internet access is unrestricted at the virtual rack level.\
3) Communications between the clouds is not blocked\
4) Nothing in the firewalls in either cloud should block the YaCy
servers from speaking with each other to share / cross- read data before
displaying combined results.\
\
Therefore we return to an Application Layer Failure in YaCY
connectivity, dating from a mis-configuration caused when patch YaCy
version 1.81/9116 was applied to both servers, consecutively.\
\
[Can someone please tell us how to restore connectivity manually and fix
the display of data for searchers and reconnect the admin screens?\
