Geht gleich gut los:

> In the spring of 2014, Jordan Younger noticed that her hair was
> falling out in clumps. "Not cool" was her reaction. At the time,
> Younger, 23, believed herself to be eating the healthiest of all
> possible diets. She was a "gluten-free, sugar-free, oil-free,
> grain-free, legume-free, plant-based raw vegan". As The Blonde Vegan,
> Younger was a "wellness" blogger in New York City, one of thousands on
> Instagram (where she had 70,000 followers) rallying under the hashtag
> \#eatclean. Although she had no qualifications as a nutritionist,
> Younger had sold more than 40,000 copies of her own \$25, five-day
> "cleanse" programme -- a formula for an all-raw, plant-based diet
> majoring on green juice.
