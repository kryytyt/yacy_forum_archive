anyone who doesn\'t want to curl up with 243 pages of testimony and
footnoted letters, here is pretty much how the thing went, severely
condensed:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2017/11/07/the-paranoid-carter-page-transcript-what-in-gods-name-did-i-just-read/?hpid=hp_no-name_opinion-card-e:homepage/story&utm_term=.72821c794f14)

> Carter Page: Hello. I am a doctor and a scholar, and I am here about
> the world premiere of the dodgy dossier that inexplicably made all
> kinds of charges against me, an innocent man who has never met anyone
> directly in my life! I have been illegally wiretapped by the FBI, CIA
> and other U.S. propaganda agencies, and my life has been ruined. I
> must be continually on the move, like a shark. I have done nothing
> wrong, but I will answer none of the questions put to me, because I
> have been studying the law. I am, as I said, a scholar. Here is a
> letter. I know it looks like a scrawl in red crayon, but trust me \--
> it is a letter about the CIA\'s illegal dossier. \[\...\]
>
> Rooney: Did you ever meet Mr. Trump?
>
> Page: No. Never. I\'ve met him in my heart. Never in my life, except
> on the television. And at rallies. I think he is beautiful and has a
> lot to teach all of us.
>
> Trey Gowdy: So, you were a volunteer, unpaid, informal, unofficial.
> What was your role, exactly?
>
> Page: Sometimes I would stand outside the glass window of the Trump
> campaign and look in admiringly, but I never ventured to set foot
> inside. I was not involved in any way, except I did sign a
> non-disclosure agreement, it will turn out, and met repeatedly with
> Sam Clovis. Honestly, no one wants me to be involved, ever. All my
> emails to them were unwelcome and went unreturned. I never went to
> Trump Tower, except for the fly-swatter incident. Whenever I showed up
> at Trump Tower, they would shoo me away with a big fly-swatter. One or
> two times or maybe eight. Ninety times. I never spoke directly to
> Donald Trump.
>
> Gowdy: Why do you keep saying \"directly\"? How else would you speak
> to a person?
>
> Page: Listen, Trey, we can speak as one lawyer to another. I am an
> expert in the law after taking a mail-order course in what I believe
> is known as the Law of the Sea, and I know a man must choose his words
> wisely.
>
> Gowdy: What?
>
> \[\...\]
>
> Page: Listen, you have to live your life. I went to a gathering of
> scholars at the New Economic School, and everyone I met there was a
> scholar, although it would be fairer to say that I greeted them than
> that I met them. I don\'t remember who any of them were. Some were
> lifelong friends.
>
> Schiff: What is a scholar? You keep describing yourself as a scholar,
> but I am not sure that word means what you think it means.
>
> Page: I would define scholar very loosely to include the Russian
> deputy prime minister, several senior officers of Russian energy
> companies, and also myself, but really I only spoke to the man on the
> street.
>
> Schiff: The man on the street.
>
> Page: The television, mostly, and I went to some speeches. And I did
> greet that man in passing who I would later discover to my horror was
> the deputy prime minister. For three seconds, tops. But mostly the
> television.
