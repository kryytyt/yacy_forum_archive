This \"Amazon Music\" app can choke on a bucket of cocks.

Amazon. Fuck them right in their Cloud.

It\'s bad enough that, previously, Amazon wouldn\'t just give me a .zip
of my MP3 album purchases, but made me dick around with their crappy
\"Amazon MP3 Downloader\" intermediary app (which seemed to need to
update itself twice a week, because come on, you couldn\'t be expected
to ever actually get something *that complicated* right, right?)

It\'s bad enough that a few months ago, they started interposing three
more clicks with every download \-- *\"Are you SURE you don\'t want to
install Amazon Cloud Player?\"* and completely ignoring me every time I
said \"No\".

But now they seem to have discontinued even that, and now the only way
to download MP3s is to go through a bunch of additional clicks in this
new bullshit \"Amazon Music\" app that seems to be trying to replicate
*all of iTunes*. And buried somewhere in there is \"Export\".

So that\'s going to work out really well for them.

It\'s almost enough to make me start buying music from *Apple* instead.
(Ha ha, I kid, I kid, nothing would ever make me sink that low.)

Hooray for user-hostile lock-in! Why don\'t you just figure out a way to
have a tiny hammer pop out of my screen and hit me in the face every
time I try to give you money!
