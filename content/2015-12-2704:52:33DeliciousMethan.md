> In early December, the Southern California Gas Company said that
> plugging the leak, which sprang in mid-October, would take at least
> three more months. Right now, the single leak accounts for a quarter
> of the state\'s entire methane emissions, and the leak has been called
> the worst environmental disaster since the BP oil spill in 2010.
>
> Part of the problem in stopping the leak lies in the base of the well,
> which sits 8,000 feet underground. Pumping fluids down into the well,
> usually the normal recourse, just isn\'t working, said Silva. Workers
> have been \"unable to establish a stable enough column of fluid to
> keep the force of gas coming up from the reservoir.\" The company is
> now constructing a relief well that will connect to the leaking well,
> and hopefully provide a way to reduce pressure so the leak can be
> plugged. Right now, relief efforts have drilled only 3,800 feet down
> \-- less than half of the way to the base of the well.
