> I came up with a very simple method of revealing geometry with
> Lightwave\'s instancing tool, and since there was a lot of procedural
> animation, I was seeing a lot of interesting shapes appear that I
> hadn\'t planned, and several layers of complexity that I didn\'t need
> to create by hand. \[\...\]
>
> Almost every shot in this animation is just a different camera angle
> from a single scene that plays out over 1500 frames. Originally, I had
> planned to create this animation as a single shot, but as I moved the
> camera around my master scene I kept finding interesting things to
> show from all kinds of different angles.
