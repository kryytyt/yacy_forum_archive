Hello everybody\
I\'m Pierre, a french student and I have 20 in some days.\
I am a new user of Yacy, but I have already a problem : I can\'t creat a
new account in the Yacy\'s Wiki because of the Captcha : It is written
there

\
Is anybody have a solution ?\
\
It is because I would like translate in french some articles. (In
addition, I could translate menus in french if you want/need.)\
\
To finish, I\'d like know what I can make to a robot goes in my website
to add it.\
\
Thanks\

Pierre
