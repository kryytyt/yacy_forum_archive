Is it somehow possible to have yacy run reliably when the index becomes
larger?\
\
I\'ve given yacy 3500 MB RAM on my VPS (need the rest for other stuff
running on the server).\
\
I allow remote crawls and DHT and have yacy index everything I browse
using the Gresemaonky script, so the index will never stop growing.
Currently, there are about 9 million documents and 31 million citations
in the index.\
\
I\'m restarting yacy four times a day using a cron job. Plus, I have it
delete documents older than 28 days every day.\
\
This has worked well for a month or so, but not anymore. yacy generally
works well for about half an hour or maximum an hour after it was
started.\
\
Then viewing pages of the admin interface still works, and search works
initially, but when I try to switch to the second page of results, the
first page is shown again.\
\
Then more and more short memory cycles are showing up in the log, then
the first exceptions for not enough Java heap space start coming up.
After a while, the log consists almost exclusively of \"W 2014/01/30
14:43:51 COLLECTION d\[\] is empty, iid=...\" lines.\
\
When the next restart is reached, in 75% of the cases a clean shutdown
is not possible anymore, and the stop script kills yacy.\
\
This has at least worked better until a week ago or so? Until that
point, yacy used to stop the crawlers before memory became too low, so
it at least stayed more or less usable. (Though searches often still
didn\'t work anymore.) Now, yacy very seldomly stops the crawlers, and
when it does, it\'s much too late.\
\
What can I do to keep my index at a size my VPS can handle? I.e. as big
as possible so that yacy can at least run without problems for six or
seven hours or so? Is there a rule of thumb how many documents yacy can
handle with a certain memory size?\
\
Why is it always working well at the beginning, but stops doing so
later? What is eating up so much memory over time? It seems to me that
crawling is the biggest problem here, but why would I run a search
engine if I can\'t have it crawl?

Are there any optimizations I could do?
