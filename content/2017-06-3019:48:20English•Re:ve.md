Hi lucipher,\
I tried to parse the URL mentioned in your logs (at
<http://www.prawo.vulcan.edu.pl>) and I confirm that as you guessed it
looks like the content makes YaCy html parser fall in a kind of endless
loop. I tried with both latest sources from GitHub and 1.92/9000 release
and got the same behavior.\
It looks like an interesting case. I will try to figure out what is
happening and check how this can be fixed.
