I just merge the changes. I did not test them but I trust you.\
\
In [loklak](https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server){.postlink} we have
four deploy-buttons, one with docker. It\'s possible to have a 1-click
deploy in the could infrastructure of your choice. It would be nice to
have that for YaCy as well. Can you have a look if that can be done for
YaCy?
