English â€¢ Image preview copyright issues
========================================

Date: 2016-01-12 00:55:33

Hi everyone, oyvinds reported an issue with image search results preview
in <http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=627#c1187>. As that mantis is
not directly related to image search I continue here the discussion.\
I would resume this way : oyvinds reports two use cases where he would
like full size images preview to work :\
- running your own YaCy node and performing search requests from your
own devices (tablet, smartphone, laptop\...) without logging in\
- using your own node to demontrate YaCy use from someone else computer,
without need for log in\
\
Currently it is true that full size image preview with YaCy is only
available from local host or after authentication with admin account.
However it is justified that one doesn\'t want to use admin login every
time he wants to only perform images search, especially from someone
else computer.\
I suggest a first fix would be to allow full size image preview for non
admin user accounts (created in /ConfigAccounts\_p.html). Should we use
already existing \"Extended Search right\" or create a new one such as
\"Full size image preview\"?\
Doing so, in the two use cases described above, there is no more admin
password sent over network, or eventually stored in a untrusted
computer.\
\
Beyond that, do you think we should also make it possible for non
authenticated users to display full size image previews in YaCy? If your
node is publicly accessible, it may be considered as copyright
infringement, depending on the country you are located (see for example
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright \...
nline\_link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_aspects_of_hyperlinking_and_framing#Inline_link){.postlink}
or [https://cliffordmillerlaw.wordpress.com \...
ringement/](https://cliffordmillerlaw.wordpress.com/2012/01/27/embedding-images-from-third-party-sites-in-websites-is-copyright-infringement/){.postlink}).\
I suggest to keep default behavior (display only thumbnails for non
authenticated users), but to allow finer configuration, choosing between
:\
- only providing image links\
- links + thumbnails\
- links + thumbnails + full size\
Thus it would be the responsibility of a YaCy peer to adjust this
config.\
\
Feedback and suggestions are welcome, especially if someone is well
informed on such legal issues.
