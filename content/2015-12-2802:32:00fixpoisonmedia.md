fix poison mediawikiimporter output queue also after ExecutionException
in worker thread.
Writer of importer keeps needs a poison to close the file. On exception (e.g. OOM)
add a poison marker in outer most try/catch to assure output queue will terminate
in this condition too (and closes+renames the surrogate/in/xxx.prt file)
```
