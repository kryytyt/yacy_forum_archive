[![](https://www.jwz.org/images/ealge-and-chicken.jpg)In a battle
between a Bald Eagle and a chicken, the chicken is definitely the long
shot.](http://www.audubon.org/magazine/fall-2016/an-organic-chicken-farm-georgia-has-become-endless)

> And yet you can\'t help but root for the eagle. It is a magnificent
> creature, precision-built to do two things that reliably fill humans
> with awe \-- fly and kill \-- and it looks completely at ease doing
> both. Swooping down, the eagle unfurls its hand-like claws, scoops up
> a chicken, and sweeps up to a tree, whereupon the larger bird lays the
> smaller bird on a branch to allow for easy consumption. It\'s unclear
> exactly when the chicken dies, but the eagle\'s beak is quite
> effective at pulling out the other bird\'s meat. After a few minutes,
> all that remains is a clump of feathers and discarded viscera. These
> gory leavings splatter anything below the tall oaks at White Oak
> Pastures, a family farm in rural Georgia \-- including, one morning,
> Jenni Harris\'s SUV.
>
> Jenni\'s father, Will Harris, the fourth-generation owner of White Oak
> Pastures in the tiny town of Bluffton (population: 100), is laughing
> as he tells me about the gut-drenched vehicle. Jenni was unperturbed,
> he explains; she simply wiped the bloody goo off the windshield before
> driving away.
>
> What else could she do? The slaughter here is relentless. White Oak is
> home to one of the largest pastured chicken flocks in the country; at
> any given time, 60,000 birds wander the land in accordance with
> pasture-raised parameters. As the next level beyond free-range, this
> farm never contains its adult birds indoors, instead allowing them to
> roam without restraint at all times. This also means that for the Bald
> Eagles that showed up a few years ago, White Oak is an all-you-can-eat
> buffet.
>
> When I visited in January, at least 75 Bald Eagles were living on the
> farm, where they overwinter October to March. At that time, Harris
> estimated each raptor was killing up to four chickens a day, racking
> up a total of at least \$1,000 in daily losses. Due to the birds\'
> protected status under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and
> other federal laws, Harris had few options. He couldn\'t kill them. He
> could try to shoo them, but most methods would be costly and likely to
> scare the chickens before the eagles.
