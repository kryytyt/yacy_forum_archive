\- While a crawl is running you can see that as an entry in
/Crawler\_p.html; when the crawl is finished it disappears there\
- the fact that the crawl is started by the scheduler can be seen in
/Table\_API\_p.html where the call count went up by one\
- and finally: in /CrawlProfileEditor\_p.html is an entry with the
status \"Finished\"
