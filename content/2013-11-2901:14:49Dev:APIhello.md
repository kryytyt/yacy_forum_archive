== The \'Hello\' Peer-Ping Process ==\
\
/yacy/hello.html is a servlet which returns a property list as result,
not a html page as the name would suggest. The purpose of this servlet
is a handshake between two peers wich ensure doing this that they are
alive and by the way transport some critical information about their
network position and the status of their operation together with some
\'news\', which is (from both sides) a list of recently known or new
peers in the network. Every peer is doing one peer-ping each minute by
calling the \'hello.html\'-servlet of one of the peers in the known list
of peers.\
\
=== Properties in the callers http header ===\
The caller puts the peer hash of the called peer in the
(HTTP/1.1-required) \'Host\' attribute. The
\[\[Dev:EnhancedBase64\|Enhanced Base64-encoded\]\] peer hash is encoded
as \[\[Dev:HexHash\|HexHash\]\] and the host name is created using this
HexHash with an appended \'.yacyh\
\' extension. A Host property in the http header looks like\
Host: d7841c7477a57de875.yacyh\
This is only necessary if the target host is a
\[\[Dev:PeerType\#mentee\|mentee peer\]\].\
\
When a peer is pinged by calling the hello.html servlet the ping\'ed
peer tries to ping the ping-ing peer back by calling the ping-ing peers
\[\[Dev:APIquery\|/yacy/query.html\]\] servlet. If the ping\'ed peer
gets a respond from the ping-ing peer, it assigns the ping-ing peer the
\[\[Dev:PeerType\#senior\|senior\]\] status, otherwise the status is
\[\[Dev:PeerType\#junior\|junior\]\]. After the ping-ing peer gets a
result, it assigns itself the status as reported by the ping process. If
the peer gets no answer at all (i.e. a timeout happens), the peer
assigns itself the \[\[Dev:PeerType\#virgin\|virgin\]\] status.\
\
=== Properties in the callers http post-arguments ===\
Calls to the servlet is made using a POST operation. The properties
are:\
\* seed=\<the \[\[Dev:SimpleCoding\|SimpleCoding\]\] of the own
\[\[Dev:Seed\|Peer Seed\]\]\>\
\* count=\<integer, wanted number of seeds to be returned\>\
\
=== Result Properties ===\
The returned document contains a list of property lines. These
properties are:\
\* version=\<YaCy version number of responding peer\>\
\* uptime=\<time the responding peer is running since startup in
minutes\>\
\* yourip=\<the IP of the requesting peer as seen in http request\>\
\* yourtype=\<the YaCy \[\[Dev:PeerType\|peer type\]\] as discovered
after a back-ping\>\
\* mytime=\<the local time of the responding peer in format
yyyyMMddHHmmss\>\
\* message=\<a status message, can contain error status\>\
\* seed\<c\>=\<a \[\[Dev:SimpleCoding\|SimpleCoding\]\] of other peer
\[\[Dev:Seed\|Peer Seed\]\]s in the network\>; this is a list of seed0
.. seed\<count\> properties where 0 \<= \<c\> \<= \<count\>. There will
be always count+1 seeds returned since the seed0-property contains
always the seed of the called peer.\
\
=== Example Usage ===\
An example URL is\
http://localhost:8090/yacy/hello.html?count=1&seed=p\|{Hash=sCJ6Tq8T0N9x,Port=8090,PeerType=junior}\
which may return something like this:\
version=0.1\
uptime=16\
yourip=127.0.0.1\
yourtype=junior\
mytime=20131128235655\
message=ok 47\
