I have only hired a cloud server of lower capacity and used it short
term.\
\
Are you using Desktop or Server version of Ubuntu?\
A txt or screen dump of (top) if you could post that would be useful?\
\
As an experiment if you wish edit (/DATA/SETTINGS/yacy.config) with yacy
shutdown.\
\
javastart\_Xmx=Xmx10112m\
javastart\_Xms=Xms2592m\
\
If you have a recent version of Yacy running and you ask it to crawl it
will [consume CPU time]{style="font-weight: bold"}, if the load is too
much I might suggest lowering the PPM for a crawling.\
\
I only have a 4 core but when I run a crawl the average load can sitting
at or around \~8 to 12 (16 to 24 on your rig). Its Linux it can take it.
