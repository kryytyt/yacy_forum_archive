PHP-based login systems
=======================

Lazyweb,

[Two years ago](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/04/dna-store-logins/) I
lamented how shitty the options were for finding a drop-in login system
that I could use in the [DNA Lounge
store](https://www.dnalounge.com/store/), so that we could remember your
shipping address and whatnot.

Has the world gotten any better since then, or is everything still
terrible?

What is the simplest way to bolt a login system onto my existing pile of
ancient, framework-less PHP code?
