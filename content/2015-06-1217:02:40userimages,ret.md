user images, retrieved with the proxy servlet, are now cached inside of
the UserEntry data record of a user. User data which is returned as
search result now also contain such images inside their user data. The
data is base64-encoded. This field is compressed inside of
elasticsearch, so no external compression is necessary. However,
exported images inside the user record can be big.
