Recall Ed Lee Campaign Has Officially
Begun:](http://brokeassstuart.com/blog/2016/10/12/the-recall-ed-lee-campaign-has-officially-begun/)

> The Department of Elections just finally released the Official
> Petition to Recall Ed Lee after 5 separate tries. The recall attempt
> is now beginning in earnest. They need to get 60,000 signatures in the
> next 160 days.
>
> Let\'s get this out of the way right here and now: Ed Lee\'s time as
> mayor of San Francisco has had the effect of being the fourth horseman
> of the apocalypse for San Francisco. Under his watch, rents skyrocket
> upwards, long-time residents of the city are being evicted, and
> homelessness is reaching epidemic proportions. If Lee has been at war
> with the soul of San Francisco, it could not be more apparent. For a
> man who was handed the coveted title of Mayor of San Francisco by
> Gavin Newsom, Lee opted to fuck a gift horse in the mouth in his
> process of snuggling up to criminals and big businesses and turning
> his back on the residents of San Francisco. \[\...\]
>
> Are you an SF resident and want to help the Recall Ed Lee Campaign?
> It\'s as easy as lending your signature to the recall petition! They
> will be collecting them in front of the San Francisco Public Library
> Wednesday to Saturday from noon to five. You can also get involved and
> stay up to date by joining the [Recall Mayor Ed Lee FB
> page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/recallmayorlee2016/). Let\'s get
> this shit bag out so we can restore our magnificent home to its
> gleaming glory.

Billionaire Ron Conway Getting \"Every Tech Employer\" To Send Workers
His Voter
Guide:](http://brokeassstuart.com/blog/2016/10/12/tech-billionaire-ron-conway-getting-every-tech-employer-to-send-workers-his-voter-guide/)

> Yesterday Joe Eskenazi [tweeted this

> Conway in which Conway tries to use his weight to get every tech

> SF Magazine [reported

> While yes it is technically legal it is *hella* shady. The main

> are listed in the letter, the \"and many others\" obviously implies he
> will be sending this to the CEOs of the companies who need Ron
> Conway\'s money for more backing. That is some fucked up shit!
>
> It\'s also shady that he\'s asking the CEOs pretend that it\'s just
> some random voter guide they came across instead of one sent to them
> BY THE GUY WHO PAYS THEM MONEY. Come on Ron we knew you were a slimy

> What kind of slimy creep? I\'m glad you asked! Ron Conway is also the
> guy who bank rolled Ed Lee\'s Reelection campaign \-- after Ed Lee
> enacted tax breaks for the companies Ron Conway invests in (like
> twitter and AirBnB). Ron Conway also drops hundreds of thousands of
> dollars into local campaigns to smear the reputations of solid
> progressive candidates who are running against people Conway backs.
> Independent expenditure committees funded by Conway have put out
> propaganda in this election suggesting that a vote for Jane Kim is an
> endorsement of domestic violence. He did the same thing against David
> Campos in 2014.
