Yes I was speaker at Campus Party 2012, the video is here:
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnpBNtqtRew> (audio is missing in the
first two minutes)\

If there are topics for a tutorial video you may suggest some. I don\'t
know when I have time to do those videos and I already made my own list
of tutorials I want to do but a user suggestion shows often that a
developer is blind for the users view on the application. So if anyone
has an idea about what would be [really]{style="font-style: italic"}
important to explain, please let me know. If you suggest more than one,
please mark them with an importance-order.
