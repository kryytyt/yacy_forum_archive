[Hi!]{style="font-weight: bold"}

I have a new router (ZXHN H108N V2.5), but seems like Yacy is not happy
with it.
![:D](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif "Very Happy")\
I have done port forwarding for the port at router\'s setup and also I
opened it at firewall\'s rules.\
\
a) At Win 10 x64 Yacy reports the port as closed, but enabling UPnP,
solves the problem.\
b) At Debian Jessie x64 KDE, UPnP is not successful, so the problem
remains.\
\
I\'ve checked the port at Windows, with pfportchecker and it reports it
as open. Also other P2P software (eg. Azureus) don\'t have any problem
with it.\
At Linux (since I don\'t have pfportchecker and I don\'t trust web based
solutions), I pointed Azureus to this port and it reported it as open
(OK).\
I already have whitelisted for TCP this port at UFW.\
\
What do you think? Is it a bug?\
Seems like Yacy have difficulties communicating to ports.
