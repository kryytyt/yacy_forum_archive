YaCy Coding & Architecture • Re: Java Web Start launch alternative

I just want to add another key point is permissions.\
\
As default Java applets or Java Web Start applications are \"Sandboxed\"
: they do not have access to file system resources for example. YaCy
needs to write files, to open a port and to connect to multiple peers.
So \"all-permissions\" element in JNLP is needed, and jar must be signed
with a certificate validated by a recognized Certificate Authority (I
created a Certum \"Open Source Developer\" certificate) or a security
warning will be displayed or application may even be blocked (users can
still add security exceptions using jcontrol program but it is a little
bit annoying).\
Note also that on latest Mac OS X even with a valid certificate Mac now
block applets and jnlp as default and user will have to add a security
exception in mac preferences.
