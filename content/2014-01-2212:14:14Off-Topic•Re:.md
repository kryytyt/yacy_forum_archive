Off-Topic â€¢ Re: Spanish corner?
===============================

Date: 2014-01-22 12:14:14

as there was again a question where to start a posting in english
language, I created an international forum category and added a
non-english/non-german forum which is locked and contains only one
posting explaining that we cannot host that there:
[viewtopic.php?f=24&t=5097](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=5097){.postlink-local}\
\
\@nicolas [please]{style="font-style: italic"}: if you are urgently
looking for a spanish space to discuss YaCy topics, just create a YaCy
forum yourself! It is not so difficult to upload a phpbb5 release to a
cheap web space, [just do that]{style="font-style: italic"}!\
\
If you do not want to do that yourself, please twitter a call for
participation in spanish language (with a link here) and I will retweet
that. Maybe someone else wants to start a spanish forum.
