YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ A generic API advanced crawler
===========================================================

Date: 2016-02-19 09:53:31

Hello, I recently found an interesting repository of public APIs
descriptions in OpenApi format :
<https://github.com/APIs-guru/api-models>.\
\
First this made me think it would be a good thing to provide a
description of YaCy API in a standardized format such as OpenApi
(Swagger) or RAML or in the most relevant format\...\
\
I also wonder if it could be possible to make a generic advanced crawler
able to request any public API, as an alternative to classical crawling.
YaCy already have MediaWiki and phpBB3 specialized crawlers and RSS and
OAI-PMH importers.\
It would be great to have the possibility to request other APIs with
little mapping work.\
\
My basic idea would be to specify in a new YaCy screen :\
- eventual required api key\
- one or more resources listing/discovery services\
- which result field(s) contain a public http resource to index\
- or wich result field(s) contain metadata to index\
- \... any other necessary information\
\
This mapping should be exportable to be shared with other YaCy users,
eventually in a specific folder in git repository.\
\
What do you think? Feasible?
