Hey ds810, this is this kind of pattern
\".\*.\*/(.\*/)\*abmw?\\.asp.\*\" ( with a \"(.\*/)\*\" capturing group)
which is highly CPU consuming against URLs having many segments in their
path (see previously mentioned sample URL).\
\
I propose to replace all occurrences of \"(.\*/)\*\" in your blacklist
file, with \"(.\*/\|)\", which do the same job but appears to be much
much more efficient (at least with JDK 7). I updated the Blacklist [unit
test](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/commit/c3c4a52408b609b841df312246e30628fc3345ac){.postlink}
with some more examples to confirm this pattern works as expected.\
\
After modifying your blacklist file, you can also immediately check
performance by using the /BlacklistTest\_p.html page.\
\
Example of concerned patterns :\
- your current version :\

Code: 
:   `.*.*/(.*/)*abmw?\.asp.*.*.*/(.*/)*ads/.*.*.*/(.*/)*adv/.*`

\
- modified version :\

Code: 
:   `.*.*/(.*/|)abmw?\.asp.*.*.*/(.*/|)ads/.*.*.*/(.*/|)adv/.*`

\
\
I have been running my peer for two hours with the modified version of
your blacklist, and until now the issue didn\'t occurred again.
