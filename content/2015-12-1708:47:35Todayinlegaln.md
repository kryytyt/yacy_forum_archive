> Detective David Edward Abbott, a member of the Northern
> Virginia-Washington DC Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force,
> last year had obtained a warrant to inject a young boy with a drug
> that would cause an erection. Abbott wanted to photograph that
> erection and compare it with photos found on a 15-year-old girl\'s
> phone. Amid a public outcry, the Manassas City police eventually
> decided against doing that. The 17-year-old boy got a year of
> probation for sexting his teen girlfriend. \[\...\]
>
> The authorities went to arrest Abbott, 39, on Tuesday. \[\...\] Abbott
> had an inappropriate relationship with a boy, now 13, police alleged.
> He was accused of soliciting sexual acts on the phone, via text
> messages and social media. Abbott was also accused of having an
> \"inappropriate relationship with a second male victim\" affiliated
> with the Prince William County hockey league.
>
> The Manassas City Police Department, Abbott\'s employer, lauded the
> officer, saying in a statement:
>
> This is a tragic and sad day for the Abbott family, the juvenile
> victims and their families, the Manassas City Police Department, and
> our community. In spite of these recent developments regarding the
> serious allegations against him, we are grateful for the contributions
> Det. Abbott made during his time with Manassas City Police, to include
> the prosecution and conviction of hundreds of criminals. His family
> and peers request privacy during this time as we grieve and struggle
> to accept the realities of such a loss.
