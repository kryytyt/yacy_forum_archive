I guess you are not receiving an \"authoritative\" answer because the
problem is simply lack of ram.\
10M records seem to commonly take 2รท4GB of ram, I guess most of them are
for the reverse words index, which won\'t shrink in size by reducing the
number of threads.\
\
I\'m facing the same problem right now, and I\'m buying new hardware as
a solution.\
Alternatively, Linux has a (stable?) module to compress ram and/or swap
pages.\
\
Besides, have you checked your VM memory settings? Maybe the 600MB limit
you mentioned is just the starting memory:\

Code: 
:   `egrep 'Xmx|Xms' ./DATA/SETTINGS/yacy.conf`
