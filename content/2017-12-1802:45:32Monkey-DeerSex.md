> The monkey-to-deer solicitations that we
> [recorded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3H-886XkN4) during the
> course of heterospecific consortships were persistent and conspicuous.
> They were diverse in their form and directed toward a particular
> target. Inter-mount behaviors exhibited by female monkeys included
> intense behavioral patterns (e.g., biting, bouncing, and pulling)
> focused toward a particular deer target. While gazing at their deer
> partners, they emitted high-pitched vocalizations that are
> indistinguishable from the typical estrus calls performed by females
> in this primate species during homospecific consortships. Finally,
> when their deer partners walked away from the heterospecific
> consortships, the female monkeys often displayed sexually motivated
> tantrums which consisted of crouching on the ground, body spasms and
> screaming, while gazing at the deer.
