Ok, so as an alternative way to launch YaCy, you can open Terminal and
launch from command line.\
Fisrt, check Java is correctly installed by typing : java -version.\
Then you can go to your YaCy app folder : cd
/YourInstallPath/YaCy.app/Contents/Resources/Java\
And finally launch with : sh startYACY.sh\
This way you may have more details on what is going wrong.\
You can also look for error messages in the log file :
/YourInstallPath/YaCy.app/Contents/Resources/Java/DATA/LOG/yacy00.log
