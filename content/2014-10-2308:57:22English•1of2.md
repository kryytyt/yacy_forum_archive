English â€¢ 1 of 2 identical machines is incredibly slow
======================================================

HI, we have 2 engines on Ubuntu. Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS\
(We have not done the \' offered \' upgrade to 14.04.1 LTS as we lost
all data the last time we attempted it)\
\

> <div>
>
> \
> New release \'14.04.1 LTS\' available.\
> Run \'do-release-upgrade\' to upgrade to it.\

\
Both are cloud installations. Each on a 30 GB block, 1 GB Ram, 1 VCPU.\
We always have the latest Ubuntu & YaCy versions and we update them
every day - whenever presented the opportunity in PuTTy.\
The have \~30 million web edges, each.\
They are both nearly constantly crawling - with a long list of scheduled
RSS feeds to process, each.\
\
They read each other, but only write locally.\
Memory reserved for JVM 768 on both machines\
\"Online Caution Caseindexer delay\" Proxy, Local Search, Remote Search
(not active) all - 5000\
\
Survey the Problem:\
A) Server 1 is fine. Fast, crawls quickly - at different
speeds-sometimes very quickly! Boots reasonably quickly from \'cold
start\' including cold reboot of Ubuntu. Good \'warm reboot\' times with
Ubuntu running.\
B) Server 2 unbelievably SLOW. Horribly Slow to boot up from a cold
start (including cold boot of Ubuntu) or restart with Ubuntu running
(take extra minutes, sometimes many), visibly much more slow to
crawl\...really miserably slowly, sometimes. Sometimes does not start
form cold boot of Ubuntu+crawler. Uses its available memory quickly,
hence the need to reboot \~ 2 X - 3 X in a 24 hour \' day \'. Sometimes
it stops & fails to respond if it doesn\'t get the most current Ubuntu
updates (and YaCy updates. Then it will start. Without it, it is dead
and won\'t re-start, apparently.)\
C) Server 2 -blocks- every day and needs manual reboots from a \'cold\'
start to stay online, even slowly. Crawled data seems OK + saved,
however.\
D) Remote requests for information from the clouds go through Slow
Server 2, presently. It often takes 1-2 minutes for a \"searched
phrase\" in red to appear in the window at / Status.html\
E) Users are frustrated because the server takes sometimes x minutes to
respond, prompting multiple clicks on \"Search\"\
\
Note: Boot up times for Ubuntu are comparable when measured by the time
needed to get a web prompt \'available\' message at the root address,
without the port number for the crawler\
\
Current specs:\
Fast Machine:\
Memory Usage\
RAM used:244.73 MB\
RAM max:742.44 MB\
DISK used:(approx.) 18.27 GB\
DISK free:6.1 GB\
\
Slow Machine:\
Memory Usage\
RAM used:717.33 MB\
RAM max:742.44 MB\
DISK used:(approx.) 15.61 GB\
DISK free:8.31 GB\
\
Updates and upgrades to ubuntu make no change in this. Updates to YaCy
also have no effect on the situation.\
\
What we want to do:\
1) Get Server 2 running at the same healthy speed as Server 1\
2) Give priority to searchers on one of the machines, so that they get a
result quickly.\
\
Thanks so much for your advice!
