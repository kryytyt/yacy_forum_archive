> placement \"sacrilegious,\" \"demonic,\" and \"disrespectful\" of a
> sacred space.
>
> The spider, named Kumo, is one of two giant robots created by a street
> theater company of artists, technicians and performers based in
> Nantes, France. The company, La Machine, was in Ottawa July 27-30 as
> part of celebrations marking Canada\'s 150th birthday.
