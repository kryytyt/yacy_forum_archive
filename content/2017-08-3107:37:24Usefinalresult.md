Use final results counts in progress bar detailed statistics.

Using unfiltered detailed counts (local and remote entries found before
doubles detection and before applying query modifiers) was confusing and
inconsistent with the total count. It could let think more results are
to come in the next pages, without understanding why they are not
displayed.
