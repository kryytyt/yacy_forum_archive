[Tessa Farmer:](http://www.tessafarmer.com/imagesswallow.html)

> Flies were laying eggs on the swallow, and their maggots consuming it,
> until the fairies snatched it from them and made it fly again by
> harnessing winged insects to its body. Now it has become a ship in
> their fleet, as well as a meal.
