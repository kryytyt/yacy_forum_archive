to hear something batshit insane about the iCal format? Sure you do!

(I write these things down in the hope that doing so will cause some
unfortunate soul in the future to waste less time learning this than I
just did. \"Today I learned something new and stupid!\")

When you\'re exporting an event as an ICS file, so that someone can add
it to their Apple or Google or Outlook calendar, you have to say what
time the event starts.

Now some people well tell you, \"just specify all your dates in UTC,
that\'s easy and unambiguous.\" But here\'s what happens if you do that:

You have an event happening in San Francisco on Feb 21 at 8pm. You
specify the time in UTC (`DTSTART:20180222T040000Z`). When someone adds
that event to their calendar, the little box shows up in the calendar
grid at 8pm just as it should. But then they double-click on it, and the
text says: \"Feb 22, 2018, 4AM to 5AM (GMT)\".

While technically true, this is not a useful or convenient thing to say
to an actual meat-based human who is expecting to attend that event.

So instead the sane thing is to specify the time in the local time zone
where the event is happening: 8pm Pacific
(`DTSTART;TZID=US/Pacific:20180221T200000`). The box still shows up in
the calendar in the same place, but now when you click on it, it says
the much more sensible \"Feb 21, 2018, 8PM to 9PM (PST)\". It even says
that if your local time zone is something else. So if you\'re in New
York and planning a trip to San Francisco, it\'s obvious to you that the
event in SF starts at 8pm local time, not 11pm local time (which is what
the clock would say in New York).

So far so good, right?

Oh, except that\'s not a valid ICS file.

Why? Because the `TZID` doesn\'t refer to the name of a time zone from
the [IANA](https://www.iana.org/time-zones)
[Zoneinfo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database) /
[Olson](https://blog.jonudell.net/2009/10/23/a-literary-appreciation-of-the-olsonzoneinfotz-database/)
Database, which has been the gold standard historical record of such
things since just about The Epoch. (This database is an absolute
treasure, documenting and clarifying an ongoing global political and
technical clusterfuck of nightmarish proportions. The work that went
into this thing is staggering. It is a treasure of nightmares. But I
digress.)

No, see, the [iCalendar
spec](https://icalendar.org/iCalendar-RFC-5545/3-6-5-time-zone-component.html)
wants each ICS file to fully document its own notion of what the
Daylight Savings Time rules are! You can\'t just say \"Look, it\'s
US/Pacific, ok? When is Daylight Savings Time? March? I dunno, whatever,
do the right thing!\" Instead you have to specify the switch-dates
explicitly!

Here\'s what Apple does:

> ` BEGIN:VTIMEZONE   TZID:America/Los_Angeles   BEGIN:DAYLIGHT     TZOFFSETFROM:-0800     RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=3;BYDAY=2SU     DTSTART:20070311T020000     TZNAME:PDT     TZOFFSETTO:-0700   END:DAYLIGHT   BEGIN:STANDARD     TZOFFSETFROM:-0700     RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=11;BYDAY=1SU     DTSTART:20071104T020000     TZNAME:PST     TZOFFSETTO:-0800   END:STANDARD END:VTIMEZONE`{style="font-size: smaller"}

What that says is: \"The definition of the `America/Los_Angeles` time
zone is that as of 2007, it is UTC minus 7 hours from the 2nd Sunday in
March through the 1st Sunday in November, and is UTC minus 8 hours
otherwise.\"

This is, of course, false, because the rules were different before 2007.
Because
[reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_time_in_the_United_States#Start_and_end_dates_of_United_States_Daylight_Saving_Time).

So while it may work for this particular calendar entry, past ones have
to be different. And let\'s say you put a far future event in your
calendar \-- the ten year anniversary of something or other \-- and in
the intervening decade, your country\'s bureaucrats change the Daylight
Savings rules again. Oops, now it\'s wrong. You\'re still in US/Pacific,
but the ICS file doesn\'t know that what that means has changed.

Because the authors of the ICS standard felt that indirecting through
the IANA rules was a *terrible idea* for some reason.

Here\'s what the full set of US/Pacific timezone rules look like, all
the way back to when the whole [idiotic idea of Daylight Savings
Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) took hold,
through today. It will *definitely* change again. The Olson database is
constantly being updated. That\'s the whole point of it!

(I didn\'t build that by hand; I coaxed Apple to spit it out by creating
and exporting an event in the 1800s.)
