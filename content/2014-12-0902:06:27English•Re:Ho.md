English â€¢ Re: How to get YACY working as a proxy
================================================

actually, I have never seen this bug myself and I pointed out that too
heavy problems with the proxy will cause that I will remove the proxy
instead of fixing this. Currently there are very much other things much
more pressing than a function that I do not want to support and where I
not even can recognize a problem.\

But here is the solution:\
- get your hands on the code\
- submit a fix
