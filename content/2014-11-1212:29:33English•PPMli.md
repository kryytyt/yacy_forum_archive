English â€¢ PPM limitations in YaCy?
==================================

Date: 2014-11-12 12:29:33

Hello, YaCy folks!\
\
Recently I decided to finally give YaCy a go.\
After a few weeks of usage and learning in the process, I got to the
point where I need help from somebody that knows more about it.\
\
I\'m interested in how PPM limitations work in YaCy.\
Since some sites have limitations for crawlers to prevent DoS and others
don\'t, I figure that YaCy must have such limitations in itself to
prevent this from happening.\
\
My question is:\
Are this limitations hardcoded into YaCy and/or are there settings that
we can tweak to adjust this limitations to our own usage needs.\
If they are hardcoded and there is no settings for this, can somebody
point me to the right files that include this limitations?
