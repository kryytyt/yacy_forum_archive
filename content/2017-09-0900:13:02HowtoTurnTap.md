> That early grocery rush could leave people without bottled water.
> Making matters worse, prices of bottled water on Amazon have
> reportedly increased since news of the hurricane broke. Even at
> regular prices, preparing for the CDC-recommended two weeks with cases
> of bottled water conceivably could cost a family of four with one dog
> more than \$500 if they could only find 16-ounce bottles.
>
> Certain corners of the internet have surfaced a technique for water
> preservation that is applicable in just such an instance. As long as
> the municipal water system is still intact, \"tap water\" can be run
> from a faucet into a storage vessel \-- a jug, if you will. A canteen
> or large bottle will also work, as will a food-grade watertight sack.
>
> Factory-bottled water costs around 2,000 times as much as
> artisanal-bottled water. The former is usually not recommended to be
> stored for longer than two years, while the latter can be stored for
> up to six months.
