5.31](http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/) out now. [iOS
version](http://itunes.apple.com/app/xscreensaver/id539014593?mt=8),
too.

-   Three new hacks this time, **GeodesicGears**, **BinaryRing** and
    **Cityflow**. And I figured out a way to make **GLPlanet** not look
    crappy.
-   All of the text-displaying hacks support UTF8 input (even if some of
    them, like Apple2, can\'t quite display all of the characters on
    output), and all text is antialiased, even on Linux. (This means
    [Zalgo Star Wars, as noted
    previously](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/10/dooming-us-to-inhuman-toil-etc-etc/)).
    To make this work I had to add a UTF8 parser to my VT100
    implementation. Like you do.
-   The problems that MacOS 10.10 had with loading text and images are
    fixed. I still [haven\'t
    upgraded](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/10/uninstalling-macos-10-10-already/)
    but I think it should be working.
-   The iOS app has a search field (pull down the top of the list).
-   iOS device rotation completely stopped working when I was forced to
    upgrade from the iOS 7 SDK to the iOS 8 SDK, so I had to rewrite a
    bunch of stuff to get it working again.

    Let me know if you have an iOS device/OS combo on which rotation
    doesn\'t work, or things are scaled wrong (don\'t fill the screen,
    or are too big for the screen.) Good tests are **\"Apple2\"** and
    **\"Endgame\"**. Do they orient properly when you rotate? When you
    rotate and then drag in \"Endgame\" does the object track your
    finger properly?

-   A fellow named [Dennis](http://panaceasupplies.com) made some good
    but *very* preliminary progress on a port to Android, so there\'s
    now an` android/` subdirectory in there. If you have an Android
    development environment installed, give it a whack and let us know
    how that works.
-   At some point \"shake to run a new saver\" stopped working. It works
    when the saver list is visible, but not when a saver is running. I
    can\'t figure it out. If you can, send me a diff!
-   I would like confirmation from someone running XScreenSaver 3.30 on
    on MacOS 10.10 that eventually the \"there\'s a new version
    available\" dialog appears, and then successfully downloads and
    installs 3.31. So if you don\'t download it manually, lemme know how
    that goes.

That\'s a lot of changes this time. But really I want to talk about
GeodesicGears because it\'s awesome.

Most of the time when I write a new saver, it kind of percolates around
in my head for a few weeks, and then I knock it out in a day or two. Not
this one. The math on this one kicked my ass for like a month. There
were a few times when I was completely stuck and the answers literally
came to me in dreams. Not like visualization dreams or anything, but
extremely literal, \"I am typing, adding struct fields, adding `for`
loops\" dreams where I crack the problem, wake up, and think, \"Oh hey,
that\'s gonna work.\" Then I basically type it in. That doesn\'t happen
to me *too* often, but it does happen with some regularly, and I really
enjoy it when it does because if I\'m expected to spend a third of my
life motionless and hallucinating I might as well be doing something I
actually *care* about with that time.

Anyway, a while back I posted some [cool gear animations by
TaffGoch](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/08/sphere-gears/). As far as I
can tell, he built those by hand in Sketchup, based on the [extensive
research by Bugman123](http://bugman123.com/Gears/), who figured out the
large set of 32-gear and 92-gear tilings of a sphere that \"work\", more
or less. So I implemented most of those. (I haven\'t done the 182-gear
models yet.)

There are still a bunch of numeric constants in my code to make these
layout work, and it bothers me that those numbers aren\'t all derived
from something basic in the model, but *most* of the layout is done
computationally, as is Good and Proper.

So the interesting thing about meshing gears on a closed surface is that
because the connectivity graph is neither directed nor acyclic, all
possible loops have to be an even number of hops, or the gears bind:
clockwise gears can only touch counterclockwise gears. If you look at
the animations, you\'ll see loops of four gears touching each other but
you can never see three. It\'s almost a map-coloring problem, I guess.

The sizes of the various gears have to match in just the right way
(outer disc edges tangent to the surface of the sphere, the right set of
discs touching and the others not); every gear has to have the same size
teeth; and tooth size and radius imply the number of teeth on a gear,
which also have to be matching multiples of the rest of the system.
There are not always solutions to all of these constraints!

In fact, the 92-gear models don\'t technically \"work\". The phase
errors build up, and sometimes you see gears that don\'t mesh properly.
If it was a real object, it would bind after a few turns. This bugs me,
but it still looks \"right\" most of the time.

Anyway. Another fun way of looking at the the chirality of meshed gears
is, instead of thinking of them as clockwise and counterclockwise, think
of them as magnets, with one flat face being positive and one negative,
so \"In\" and \"Out\" have different polarity. You get the same layout
constraints, because \"heads\" can only be adjacent to and touching
\"tails\".

That\'s the idea behind [Kenneth Snelson\'s model of the
atom](http://kennethsnelson.net/PortraitOfAnAtom.pdf):

He discovered the 5, 8, 10, 14 and 18-disc layouts that work, and I
tossed those into the mix as well. (His 32 disc layout is the same as
one of Bugman123\'s 32 disc layouts, because it\'s the case where the
20-count gears and the 12-count gears happen to be the same size).
