I see no way this could possibly go wrong.

new CAPTCHA test: \"upload a clear photo of your
face\".](https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-new-captcha-test-upload-a-clear-photo-of-your-face/)

> According to a screenshot of the identity test shared on Twitter on
> Tuesday and verified by Facebook, the prompt says: \"Please upload a

> then permanently delete it from our servers.\"

\"Just like we ~~probably~~ ~~maybe~~ oughta do with your
[nudes](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2017/11/facebook-says-send-nudes/).\"

[Facebook rolls out AI to detect suicidal posts before they\'re
reported:](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/27/facebook-ai-suicide-prevention/)

> Facebook\'s new \"proactive detection\" artificial intelligence
> technology will scan all posts for patterns of suicidal thoughts, and
> when necessary send mental health resources to the user at risk or
> their friends, or contact local first-responders. By using AI to flag
> worrisome posts to human moderators instead of waiting for user

\"Artificial intelligence\" is what we used to call \"grepping for
keywords\", right? Or does the fact that it\'s a TECHNOLOGY mean it has
twice as many of the cybers?

\"Complicate\". Uh huh.

To paraphrase a friend: It\'d be nice if they\'d maybe try scanning for
Moldovan Troll Farms before they started sending armed thugs to
peoples\' doors.
