YaCy Coding & Architecture â€¢ YaCy Release 1.90
==============================================

Date: 2016-07-04 13:15:58

Today I released YaCy 1.90 and made a large step from 1.83 to 1.90
because of the long time since 1.82 and the huge amount of work that was
made since then, now mainly from reger and sixcooler.\

If you have a loog at the github graphs
[https://github.com/yacy/yacy\_search\_ser \...
ntributors](https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server/graphs/contributors){.postlink}
then it becomes obvious that reger almost took over development in the
last year.\
