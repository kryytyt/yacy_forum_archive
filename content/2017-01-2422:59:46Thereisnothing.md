[On The Propriety Of Punching
Nazis:](http://thoughtsonthedead.com/on-the-propriety-of-punching-nazis-an-faq/)

> **What happened to letting the other guy throw the first punch?**
>
> Nazis don\'t throw the first punch. Nazis burn the first Reichstag.
>
> **What about dialogue?**
>
> Dialogue is for reasonable people acting in good faith. Dialogue is
> between two acceptable positions. \"Taxes need to be raised\" vs.
> \"taxes need to be lowered\" is grounds for dialogue. \"Taxes need to
> be raised\" vs. \"Jews should be thrown in ovens\" is grounds for a
> beating.
>
> **But isn\'t this sinking to their level?**
>
> That depends. After you punch the Nazi, do you espouse the tenets of
> National Socialism?
>
> **Isn\'t this a slippery slope?**
>
> After we defeated the Nazis in World War II, did we keep shooting
> people or did the troops come home and start having babies?
>
> **The second thing.**
>
> There you go. The slippery slope argument is nine times out of ten
> bullshit. Human beings are good with slippery slopes: we build stairs.
