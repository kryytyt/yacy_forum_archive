Foul

This quote has been haunting me recently:

> \"One side, our side, sees a foul as being against the rules, and if
> you do it too many times you have to be removed. The other side sees
> fouls as things you\'re allowed to get caught doing twice, and if you
> don\'t, you aren\'t trying hard enough.\"
>
> \"So you\'re mad at Jimmy because you think his side cheats at life.\"
>
> \"Partly. Mostly I\'m mad because I\'m pretty sure his side is going
> to win.\"
