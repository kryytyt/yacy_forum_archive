\
thats correct, this interface is just a recording of the request. It
does not mean that the request is completely worked off.\

Thats about the /Table\_API\_p.html page. There is just one count and I
mean the column \'call count\'\

That should be in the table \"Crawl Profile List\" at the bottom. If
there is an entry there with the \"Status\" column with \'Running\', it
shows also in the /Crawler\_p.html page. If this is finished then the
entry status is just changed to \'finished\' and the entry remains
there.
