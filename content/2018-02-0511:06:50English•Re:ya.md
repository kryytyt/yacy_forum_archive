Thanks for your fast reply,\
\
I\'m ok with either github or mantis issue, but maybe it\'s worth for
the moment describing my understanding here.\
\
And I can provide users expectations vs actual results: the search
portal is <https://doc.ouahpiti.info/> and an example search is
\"remina\" that may lead to <https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/remmina> (it\'s a
one character edit), while using \"remmina\" is ok.\
\
I saw the DidYouMean class, but I don\'t know what I can do with it, nor
how. Does it needs to be used through API calls ? If the answer is yes,
it is a good point: for the moment, the portal is a demo; it may lead to
an integration into the website, in that case, the API will be used.
