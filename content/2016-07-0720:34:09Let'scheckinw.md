> More than a decade later, the four hippos that Escobar bought from a
> private zoo in California have multiplied to 35 animals, an invasive
> species that spreads disease, predates on local fauna (including
> manatees) and livestock, and have been sighted as far as 150km away
> from Escobar\'s former home. The animals can live up to 60 years and
> there are no natural predators for them in Colombia. Further
> complicating the effort to control their reproduction is that it\'s
> incredibly hard to castrate a hippo: first, because it annoys the
> hippo; and second, because hippo testicles retract into their bodies,
> making it nearly impossible to sex a hippo without a rather intimate
> inspection.
>
> The current strategy is containment-based: local vets and officials
> are trying to build a fenced-in habitat for the hippos that has
> everything they need to tempt them to stay, and a combination of
> natural and constructed barriers to keep them from wandering.

*And you thought [manatees]{.underline} were the apex predator!*
