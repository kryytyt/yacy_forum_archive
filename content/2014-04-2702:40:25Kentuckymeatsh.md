> The Kentucky meat shower was an incident where large chunks of red
> meat fell from the sky in a 100 by 50 yard area near Olympia Springs,
> Bath County, Kentucky, for a period of several minutes on March 3,
> 1876. \[\...\] The meat appeared to be beef, but two locals who tasted
> it stated that it tasted like mutton, venison, or lamb. \[\...\]
>
> Dr. Allan McLane Hamilton stated that the meat had been identified as
> lung tissue from either a horse or a human infant (\"the structure of
> the organ in these two cases being very similar.\")\[3\] The makeup of
> this sample was backed up by further analysis, with two samples of the
> meat being identified as lung tissue, three samples were of muscle
> tissue, and two of cartilage.
>
> Out of the many theories for an explanation of this phenomenon, the
> most likely appears to be that a large pack of buzzards flew over the
> area after having eaten a couple of freshly dead horses, and when one
> of them spontaneously disgorged itself, all the others (as apparently
> is customary amongst buzzards) followed suit.\[2\]\[3\]
>
> Other less-conventional explanations were put forward, including
> author William Livingston Alden stating that \"cosmic meat\" was
> floating around in space that would drop through our atmosphere
> similarly to meteorites.\[4\]\[verification needed\]
