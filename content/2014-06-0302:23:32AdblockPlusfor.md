Adblock Plus for Safari
=======================

Date: 2014-06-03 02:23:32

Any of you using [Adblock Plus for
Safari](https://adblockplus.org/en/safari)? As far as I can tell, it
just doesn\'t fucking work. Domains that I\'ve added to my filter list
are still loading, and I don\'t see way to feed it a URL and ask \"are
you gonna block this or not\" like Privoxy had.

The only reason I\'m exploring using something other than Privoxy is
that proxies can only block non-SSL connections, and that\'s finally
beginning to matter.) (No I don\'t want to MITM myself, that\'s too much
work.)
