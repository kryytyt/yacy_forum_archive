[![](https://www.jwz.org/images/theclapgy0wl5.gif)XScreenSaver
5.34](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/) out now.

To my shame, someone discovered a way to crash out of the xscreensaver
lock dialog.

The proximate cause was that an internal consistency check failed
because I meant to be checking \"am I running on the signal stack?\" but
I was checking \"is the `SIGCHLD` signal currently inhibited?\" instead.
And that condition was triggered by hot-swapping monitors while the
display was locked.

But wait, why does your code that prompts for passwords need to have
signal handlers and manually and explicitly respond to hardware
reconfiguration? Because fuck you that\'s why.

Blah blah X11, complexity, privilege separation, doomed, get a Mac.
