Online comics shops?
====================

what is your preferred online comics shop?

By which I mean, \"I enter a list of titles I want to read, and they
mail me paper comics once a week without me having to do anything.\"
Bonus points if they have a mechanism to mail me GN comps as they are
released instead of single issues.

I had been using [Heavy Ink](https://heavyink.com/) for years, and they
were good, but apparently they\'re shutting down next month.

Because this is a Lazyweb post, allow me to clarify:

-   I am not talking about reading comics online, or on a device, or any
    form of digital delivery. I don\'t read \"real\" comics (or books)
    that way and I\'m not interested in starting.
-   I\'m sure your local brick-and-mortar shop is awesome. I don\'t
    care.
-   The answer is neither Amazon nor eBay.
