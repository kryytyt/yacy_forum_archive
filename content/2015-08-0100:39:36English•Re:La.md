English â€¢ Re: Language filter ineffective
=========================================

the language detection in YaCy was always fuzzy. Just recently I made
experiments with language detection based on bayes filters in the loklak
project. This works in many cases, but fails also quite often. This is
just really a complex thing. I will try to add the loklak method to YaCy
maybe, I already added the bayes classes but they will be used for
something else first.
