As a data point, I never once shopped there, because I\'ve been buying
all of my books online since *before they opened in 1997*, when
bookstores were *already* a nonviable business.

I had a drink at the cafe once, though. It was fine.

Businesses fail when operating costs outstrip income, period.
Cherry-picking a *proximate* cause of increased costs as *the* reason
just demonstrates what political bone you have to pick, not the actual
economics of the situation.

It\'s like those jackass restaurants whose reaction to having to pay
healthcare for their employees was to passive-aggressively break that
out on the bill as its own line item (and then [just pocketed the money
anyway](http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2013/05/08/more-sf-restaurants-settle-city-over-fraudulent-employee-health-surcharges)).
To their credit, though, these places also all itemized out
\"transportation costs\" when gas hit \$4.50/gallon, and reduced their
prices when gas got cheaper again. Oh wait, that didn\'t actually
happen.
