I did save my DATA folder from the laptop

I guessed that it should be the case.\

Renting a VPS could be a solution. I might switch to that if I cannot
achieve setting up Yacy on my Olinuxino board. I shall come to you then,
if I meet any problems

thank you!\

Right now I still would like to have my installation at home, to save a
little money (especially in a long-term perspective) and to be able to
upgrade easily my installation, for instance by replacing the HDD from
320 Gb to 1 Tb or whatever when it is close to be full. Maybe I am
mistaken, but I feel like the needed storage can increase quite quickly
(my DATA folder is about 8 Gb after less than 10 searches), and I would
not like to depend on an external service to upgrade it.
