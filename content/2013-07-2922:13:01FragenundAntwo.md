Fragen und Antworten â€¢ How to prevent everyone to use the YaCy frontend?
========================================================================

Hello,\
\
I like to prevent everyone from outside my intranet to use the YaCy
frontend.\
\
When people know my IP and the YaCy port number they can use my YaCy
installation. I can lock the admin settings, but people can still use my
search engine. I really want to contibute to the Yacy P2P network, but I
like to keep the frontend private. Is there an option I missed?\
