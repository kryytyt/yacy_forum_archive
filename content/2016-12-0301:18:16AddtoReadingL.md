Add to Reading List
===================

Date: 2016-12-03 01:18:16

Dear Lazyweb, every now and then \"Add to Reading List\" stops working
in both Feedly and Reeder on my iPad. It says \"Ok!\" but when I switch
to Safari, the link is not there. Sometimes it magically fixes itself,
but usually not until I\'ve already permanently lost 20+ links that I
meant to read later.

One time, I was able to get this working again through some combination
of:

-   Settings / Safari / Clear History and Website Data;
-   Settings / Safari / Advanced / Website Data / Remove;
-   Restarting both apps.

But I\'m not sure which really did it.

Any idea what causes it, how to make it never happen again, or at least
how to get a god damned error message saying \"the god damned link was
not god damned saved\"?

Note that this is not a problem with iCloud not syncing the reading list
between multiple devices \-- it\'s not even making it to the *local*
Safari reading list.

(You may be itching right now to tell me about some third party cloud
bookmark tool. Please don\'t.)
