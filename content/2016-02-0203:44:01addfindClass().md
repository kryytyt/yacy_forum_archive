add findClass() to servlet class loader (used in YaCyDefaltServlet)
In the 2 cases where servlet calls servlet the jvm classloader chain is
invoked and servlet class loaded by jvm loader (successful while requiring 
htroot in system classpath). This patch uses the standard override design
for loaders to handle these cases (making in not longer crucial to have htroot 
in system classpath, as this classLoader is mainly used for servlets and
looks in this case for the class in the configured path).
+ As the default classloader is parallelcapable we should register this too.
