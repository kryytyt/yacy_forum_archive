Hi sixcooler,\
thanks for that clarification. I could not find a good \"newbe\" setup
for yacy. The defaults don´t seem to be good for a start - alt last if
you don´t have a real clue about search engines (such as me).\
It would be great if the wiki could have some examples for the setup
which makes it more clear \"what if\...\".\
\
I started experimenting with yacy because i like the concept of a free
search engine which uses the p2p concept. I am not interested in the
depths of search engine algorithms. For an ignorant like me the 3
million links for 66 GB don´t look as a success.\
\
May I ask you about your setup? You have quite some documents on your
server. How much GB do they take?
