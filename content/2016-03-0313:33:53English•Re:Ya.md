Hello, to my mind it si sufficient to set this new feature off by
default and to add a parameter which can eventually activate it.\
But, if you have some more time, I think it is even better if you add a
configuration option which can activate/desactivate it all time, default
being off. Of course, any eventual request parameter would override
config value\... It is a little bit more complicated, but there are many
examples in YaCy sources.
