``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
added a very simple AND and OR parser for queries which works only
correct if the query contains either only AND or only OR junctors. A
true and sound query term parser is much more complex and will replace
this naive implementation later. This is only here to make disjunction
in loklak wall set-up possible.
