English â€¢ Queries per hour reporting
====================================

Date: 2014-10-16 11:00:26

I ran an hour long test today with my robot keyboard and found on the
network page had errors in reporting the local QPH rate.\
\
Can some one explain to me how the QPH totals are calculated?\
\
My peer has been up for 2 hours now and there has been 80 remote
requests. /AccessTracker\_p.html?page=4\
That would imply I should see 40 QPH but Yacy reports only 1.19 QPH for
remote.\
\
I have reported a bug but can someone else calculate the up time in
hours then divide by the number of remote requests
/AccessTracker\_p.html?page=4 and add a comment to
<http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=487> if you agree with me.\
\
At a guess the reported figure is about 33 times lower, I did a quick
add up on senior an principal peers and the QPH could be around 7500.
