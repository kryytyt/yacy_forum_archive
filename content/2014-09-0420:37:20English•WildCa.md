==========================================

Date: 2014-09-04 20:37:20

Is it possible to use a partial word and then have different suffixes
appended.\
\
Kind of like if im searching for inflatable but also want stuff with
inflate or inflation to show up i could just do inflat\* and then all
the different wildcards would apply\
\
possible or not possible?\
\
I use YaCy right now as a private search engine for my Tumblr as Tumblr
does not support full text search. Though it does now for me!\
\
Thanks YaCy!\
\
By indexing my tumblr is there a way for me to make my YaCy searchable
so people can full text search my tumblr?
