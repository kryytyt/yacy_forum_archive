I haven\'t seen any actual news sites reporting on it, just techwankery
blogs all citing the same source. When [Stross said he wanted bitcoin to
die in a
fire](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/12/why-i-want-bitcoin-to-die-in-a.html),
I assume this is what he meant. (He\'s always complaining about his
fiction coming true too soon, you know.)
