English â€¢ Yacy server performance Testing
=========================================

Date: 2014-05-06 14:57:55

I have YaCy 1.71/9150 installed on a 1.6 GHz Notebook about 15 months
old (A cheap one) and have been doing more stress testing with my Robot
keyboard.\
\
I would like to create a list of hardware speed and specs VS Remote QPH
also coupled with search complexity eg one word, two words three words.\
\
PC Type Linux/Win QPH 1 word 2 word 3 word\
Core 2 duo 1.6 GHz Win7 64 10000 500 need search list\
\
I have a video of such a test looking at 2 PC\'s on one screen half
each.\

\
If anyone would like a Free Stress Test on there YaCy Server PM with
details.\
Note I am limited by ADSL 2 + download bandwidth so a 1 word search may
not load your server up.
