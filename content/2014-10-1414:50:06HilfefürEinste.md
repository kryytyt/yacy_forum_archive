Hello tinkerphone,\
\
for my index of 48 million documents YaCy uses about 100GB.\
But my Setup ist not representative, because I limit my index very
much:\
\
I use a Limitation of number of references per word of 10.000, wich is
very low, but having a high amount of RWIs uses much RAM\
(/IndexControlRWIs\_p.html)\
\
I don\'t use any Web Structure Index.\
Even this is a cool feature of YaCy, this takes a lot of resources. For
me the benefit does not compensate the cost, but perhaps I should give
it another try.\
(/IndexFederated\_p.html)\
\
I limit the token count in the solr-schema.\
Doing so limits the amount of space used by the Index by cost of loosing
the full information of the documents.\
\
As you can see I gave up a lot to get my Index that compact.\
\
