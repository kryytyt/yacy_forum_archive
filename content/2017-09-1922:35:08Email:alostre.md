on the Unfrozen Caveman show, I learned that when iOS displays a
notification about new email, it ignores the `text/plain` part in a
`multipart/mixed` message and instead displays the `text/html` part,
after stripping all the tags without ceremony or finesse.

Because that\'s a totally reasonable thing to do.

It\'s not like \"Hey I would like to display a plain-text version of
this angry tag salad\" is *why `multipart/mixed` exists in the first
place* or anything.

My guesses on the thought process here, from least to most likely:

-   Eh, everybody just generates their `text/plain` part by stripping
    tags anyway, without even the courtesy-reacharound of turning `<BR>`
    into `\n` so why bother?
-   I tried that but then 90% of my mail notifications turned into,
    \"Please use an HTML capable mail reader to view this message\"
    because nobody generates `text/plain` parts but for unknown reasons
    they feel compelled to include them anyway.
-   By the time we are putting that dialog on the screen, we are thirty
    levels above the last framework that had access to the MIME parts,
    because that\'s how software works now, so fuck it, fuck it all,
    burn it all down.
-   Even though I\'m on the team that writes a mail reader, I have not
    read RFC2046.
-   Herp derp I eat paste.
