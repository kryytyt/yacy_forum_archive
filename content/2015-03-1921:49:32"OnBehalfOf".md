\"On Behalf Of\"
================

Dear Lazyweb, can anyone explain to me the conditions under which
Outlook corrupts the \"From\" field by putting \"On Behalf Of\" into it?

Does it always copy Sender into there? Or Return-Path? Or is it doing
something even *more* stupid?

E.g., an outgoing message, as received at Google, looks like this:

> Return-Path: \<A\@gmail.com\>\
> Received: from \... by mx.google.com \... TLSv1\
> Sender: A\@gmail.com\
> From: Full Name \<A\@dnalounge.com\>\
> X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.2070.6)

And then when some schmuck who has the poor taste to be using Outlook
hits reply, this is what comes back:

> Delivered-To: A\@gmail.com\
> Return-Path: \<B\@example.com\>\
> Received: \... by mx.google.com \... for \<A\@gmail.com\> \...
> TLSv1.2\
> Received-SPF: neutral \... neither permitted nor denied\
> Authentication-Results: \... spf=neutral\
> Received: \... TLSv1 for \<A\@dnalounge.com\>\
> From: `"`Other Guy`"` \<B\@example.com\>\
> To: `"'`Full Name`'"` \<A\@dnalounge.com\>\
> X-Mailer: Microsoft Office Outlook 12.0\
> \
> *Herp derp I top-reply*\
> \
> \-\-\-\--Original Message\-\-\-\--\
> From: Full Name **\[mailto:A\@gmail.com\]** On Behalf Of Full Name\
> Sent: Wednesday, March 04, 2015 9:01 PM\
> To: Other Guy\
> \
> *Herp derp I quote the entire message*

Now I\'m just an unfrozen caveman, your modern `MICROS~1` ways frighten
and confuse me, but one thing that I DO know is that presenting a
mailto: link pointing at the contents of the Sender: header is *complete
insanity* and I would like it to stop.
