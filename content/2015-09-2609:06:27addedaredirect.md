``` {style="white-space:pre-wrap;width:81ex"}
added a redirect resolver based on the apache httpclient which is twice
as fast as the old one. The bad thing is: it does not resolve all the
given shortlinks. TODO: add a recognition to select which unshortener
has to be used according to the shortlink-host.
