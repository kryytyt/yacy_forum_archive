shockingly remains
wet:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some two-thirds of citations for driving in transit lanes and bike
lanes, failing to yield to pedestrians, and other motor vehicle
violations, are issued to Transportation Network Company (TNC) cars
such as Uber and Lyft -- this according to a study from the police
department of violations in downtown San Francisco. [...]</p>
<p>What makes the numbers so shocking, said Supervisor Aaron Peskin, is
that they are so disproportionate. \&ldquo;You have one out of four cars
being a TNC in the district I represent,\&rdquo; he said. \&ldquo;You would think
the number of violations would be the same, one out of four, but what
you\&rsquo;re seeing is the opposite -- almost three out of four are TNC
drivers.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;It was really astonishing to see the number of TNCs that routinely
use the bike lane as the drop off spot with no regard to the fact that
cyclists are using it,\&rdquo; said Supervisor Jeff Sheehy, who sits on the
committee. He joined a protest for protected bike lanes on Valencia
this month.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;These numbers confirm what our members experience on the streets of
San Francisco everyday: Uber and Lyft drivers violating the law and
threatening the safety of people who bike and walk. Now that SFPD data
proves they are doing so in numbers far disproportionate to their
share of traffic volume, this should be a wake-up call to the city and
the industry,\&rdquo; wrote Brian Wiedenmeier, the SF Bike Coalition\&rsquo;s
executive director, in an email to Streetsblog. [...]</p>
<p>Streetsblog would like to point out that while San Francisco currently
has little power to regulate TNCs, aside from continuing to issue
citations, it can, obviously, regulate street design. As the
human-protected bike lane protests have shown, TNCs aren\&rsquo;t an issue
when they are physically prevented from stopping in a bike lane.
Properly designed protected bike lanes and intersections can make much
of this a moot point. And banning private cars from Market Street will
make much of this a moot point too -- more so if the Supervisors and
SFMTA have the fortitude to ban all cars, instead of just privately
owned ones. Continuing to do studies and discuss parking needs, and
tearing out unofficial safe-hit posts, instead of installing protected
bike lanes as quickly as possible -- not so much.</p>
