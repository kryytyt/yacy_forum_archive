<p><a href="https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2017/05/08/theres-way-worse-videos-todays-students-on-the-la-riots-and-rodney-king/">Today\&rsquo;s students on Rodney
King:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I mentioned Rodney King in an Intro to American Government class. I
got the blank \&ldquo;Is that a thing we are supposed to know?\&rdquo; look that I
have come to recognize when students hear about something that
happened more than six months ago. \&ldquo;Rodney King?\&rdquo; More blinking.
\&ldquo;Can someone tell why the name Rodney King is important?\&rdquo;</p>
<p>One student, god bless her, raised her hand. I paraphrase: \&ldquo;He was
killed by the police and it caused the LA Riots.\&rdquo; I noted that, no,
he did not die, but the second part of the statement was indirectly
true. God bless technology in the classroom -- I pulled up the grainy
VHS-camcorder version of the video, as well as a transcript of the
audio analysis presented at trial. We watched, and then talked a bit
about the rioting following the acquittal of the LAPD officers at
trial. They kept doing the blinking thing. I struggled to figure out
what part of this relatively straightforward explanation had managed
to confuse them.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Are there questions? You guys look confused.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hand. \&ldquo;So he was OK?\&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;He was beaten up pretty badly, but, ultimately he was. He died a few
years ago from unrelated causes (note: in 2012).\&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hand. \&ldquo;It\&rsquo;s kind of weird that everybody rioted over that. I mean,
there\&rsquo;s way worse videos.\&rdquo; General murmurs of agreement. [...]</p>
<p>This is a generation of kids so numb to seeing videos of police
beating, tasering, shooting, and otherwise applying the power of the
state to unarmed and almost inevitably black or Hispanic men that they
legitimately could not understand why a video of cops beating up a
black guy (who <em>didn\&rsquo;t even die</em> for pete\&rsquo;s sake!) was shocking
enough to cause a widespread breakdown of public order. [...]</p>
<p>These kids have grown up in a world where this is background noise. It
is part of the static of life in the United States. Whether these
incidents outrage them or are met with the usual excuses (Comply
faster, dress differently, be less Scary) the fact is that they happen
so regularly that retaining even one of them in long term memory is
unlikely. To think about Rodney King is to imagine a reality in which
it was actually kind of shocking to see a video of four cops kicking
and night-sticking an unarmed black man over the head repeatedly. Now
videos of police violence are about as surprising and rare as weather
reports, and forgotten almost as quickly once passed.</p>
