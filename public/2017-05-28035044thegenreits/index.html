<p>Insulting headline aside, I kind of love this:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/23/salvation-mode/"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/giphy-9.gif" alt="" /> The forgotten joys of the
screen
saver:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If screen savers still have an eschatological tinge for me, it\&rsquo;s also
because of their own demise. We no longer need them now, when our
phones nudge us at all hours, our inboxes bloat, and dystopian
headlines scorch themselves onto our consciousnesses. Our laptops,
when we look away from them, have optimized screen protection with a
bland and dreamless sleep mode. What we abandoned with the death of
screen savers -- themselves testifiers of disuse -- was a culture
that could accept walking away from life onscreen.</p>

<p>Might we call the screen saver an artistic ideal? F. T. Marinetti, in
1909, planted the flag of futurism in the art world with the following
declaration: \&ldquo;Up to now, literature has extolled a contemplative
stillness, rapture, and reverie. We intend to glorify aggressive
action, a restive wakefulness, life at the double, the slap and the
punching fist.\&rdquo; Despite screen savers\&rsquo; frequent tendency towards
futurist abstractions, they revel in the stillness, rapture, and
reverie Marinetti despised. Their banality approaches sublimity. Of
course, we\&rsquo;re now used to the heroic nostalgia with which custodians
of culture acquire relics from the Internet\&rsquo;s own dusty, evanescent
museum. As emoticons, computer games, and GIFs are exhumed and then
corralled into prestige institutions to be coated with the respectable
patina of Art, we marvel at how what once was ubiquitous or clunky can
now be considered aesthetically or conceptually profound. But of all
the overlooked digital antiques of the computer\&rsquo;s youth, perhaps the
most thrilling is the screen saver. Visually mesmerizing,
intellectually engaging, and nearly decommodified, the best screen
savers achieve the virtues of multiple art movements. They even make a
damning statement: the faintest human touch breaks their spell.
[...]</p>

<p>You can\&rsquo;t consume a screen saver in an instant. You can\&rsquo;t
fast-forward or rewind one. The genre, its own kind of endurance art,
shuns immediacy. Fugitives from time, screen savers possess no real
beginning or end. Their ouroboric nature is perhaps why preservations
on YouTube, whether ten minutes or twelve hours long, tend to evoke
disenchantment. Decades ago, stumbling upon a screen saver in a shared
living room -- or perhaps finding an entire office full of them at
lunchtime, cubicles lambent with workers\&rsquo; judiciously chosen modules
-- likely signaled your own solitude. When you\&rsquo;re watching one
intentionally, that feeling never arrives. [...]</p>

<p>Then there are the slick stock photographs of fjords and aurora
borealis so endemic to LCD and plasma, the islands we long to be
marooned on. Screen savers depict what we desire -- often with a Ken
Burns panning effect. [...]</p>

<p>If the nineties and early aughts were a time of collaborative whimsy
for screen savers, our current era treats them as an afterthought.
Inspecting my laptop\&rsquo;s default modes, which include jubilant
penguins, pastoral landscapes, and the cosmos, it becomes apparent
that today\&rsquo;s screen savers are designed to tranquilize. That\&rsquo;s a
shame. The screen savers of my youth told me life was full of rapture
and reverie, and stillness, too.</p>
