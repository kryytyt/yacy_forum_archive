<p>baby, i know places we won\&rsquo;t be found. the old oak growing
upside-down in the backyard. the lake of human hair three miles west.
canada</p>

<p>our song is the way you laugh, exposing row after row of venomous
incisors</p>

<p>she\&rsquo;s not a saint, and she\&rsquo;s not what you think. she\&rsquo;s an actress,
whoa -- she\&rsquo;s a vessel for forty-six gods whose names taste like
cold silver</p>

<p>she wears high heels; all my feet are bare. she\&rsquo;s cheer captain, and
i live deep under the bleachers, watching, my mandibles gently
clicking</p>

<p>i\&rsquo;m really gonna miss you picking fights, and me falling for it,
disemboweling you, and stringing your intestines from the ceiling fan</p>

<p>got a long list of ex-lovers; they yearn to tell you i\&rsquo;m insane.
unfortunately, none of them have mouths anymore</p>

<p>cause like, we hadn\&rsquo;t seen each other in a month when you said you
needed space. as per your request, i sent you to a distant nebula to
rot.</p>

<p>i could show you incredible things: stolen kisses, pretty lies, the
flimsy gauze which staunches the bleeding wound in the sky</p>

<p>don\&rsquo;t you worry your pretty little mind. people throw rocks at things
that shine. and pitchforks at things that crouch atop their roofs</p>

<p>now i\&rsquo;m lying on the cold hard ground. now i\&rsquo;m melting through it.
now i\&rsquo;m assimilating into the magma below. trouble, trouble, trouble.</p>

<p>romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. i\&rsquo;ll be waiting. always
waiting. i have poisoned and cocooned my fellow capulets to be safe</p>

<p>i\&rsquo;m not a princess. this ain\&rsquo;t a fairytale. i\&rsquo;m not molting. those
ain\&rsquo;t scales hidden beneath. i swear</p>

<p>cause baby, i could build a castle out of all the bricks they threw at
me. i could also absorb the bricks into my gelatinous skin as armor</p>

<p>never thought we\&rsquo;d have a last kiss. never imagined we\&rsquo;d end like
this, cornered and quivering before these immense, slavering jaws</p>

<p>someday i\&rsquo;ll be living in a big old city, feasting on the engorged
and ancient creatures in the sewers, and all you\&rsquo;re ever gonna be is
mean

<a href="https://samkriss.wordpress.com/2015/02/10/taylor-swift-swallows-the-world/"><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/24k8mebk_400x400.png" alt="" />\&ldquo;Swift is
positioning herself as a human acheiropoieton, something outside the
dreary chain of reproductive
existence.\&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fine: I don\&rsquo;t tend to make a point of parading around my naked
umbilicus either. It\&rsquo;s a revolting hole, a foetid salty lint-clogged
scar, a gaping absence that\&rsquo;s only a reminder of something
irretrievably lost. With only that hole remaining the condition of
humanity must always be one of absolute disconnection; we\&rsquo;ve been
snipped apart from a primal unity, and it\&rsquo;s not coming back until the
day we die. Our genitals tell us that we can bring ourselves together,
and even create something new; our navels whisper bitterly that we
will always be alone. In the enlightened society of the future, they
will always be covered; the belly button more than deserves its share
of the socially mandated shame that somehow bypasses it in its mad
rush southwards from nipples to pudenda. But it\&rsquo;s not just that. The
navel marks a person as a created being; by feigning for so long to be
without one Taylor Swift is positioning herself as a human
acheiropoieton, something outside the dreary chain of reproductive
existence. A new Eve? Or something more? Something that exists now,
and always has, and always will? [...]</p>

<p>All this, she said, was the work of none other than the award-winning
Latin pop artist Enrique Iglesias, in his manifestation as Cloud-Man,
an empyrean figure she seemed to identify with the God of Abraham. In
the beginning, Enrique Iglesias created the heavens and the earth.
It\&rsquo;s not an uncommon belief; once you notice it you\&rsquo;ll find it
everywhere. [...]</p>

<p>Usually, this is where I\&rsquo;d rail against the coming Swiftopia, but
here I don\&rsquo;t really see the point. Taylor Swift is a grown woman and
a successful recording artist; if she wants to transform herself into
the fundamental substance of the entire Symbolic order that\&rsquo;s her
business, and I\&rsquo;m sure she\&rsquo;ll do a decent job of it. The signifier
is essentially hollow; it doesn\&rsquo;t matter what it actually is as long
as it performs its function. Taylor Swift might have to release a few
less commercially-oriented albums to make all this fully possible --
one to allow the translation of Hegel into the new language, another
to make sure football commentaries don\&rsquo;t lose any of their immediate
comprehensibility -- but, based on current trends, the whole process
shouldn\&rsquo;t take more than about a decade. The only question is why
Taylor Swift is doing this; why she\&rsquo;s decided to swallow the world.
