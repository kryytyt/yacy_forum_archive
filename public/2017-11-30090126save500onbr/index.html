<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bnharrison/status/934559167867650048"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/2017/dphsqfcwsaexnn1.jpg" alt="" />{sizes=&ldquo;(max-width: 660px) 50vw, 36em&rdquo;
srcset=&ldquo;https://www.jwz.org/images/2017/dphsqfcwsaexnn1.jpg 605w, https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/360/2017/dphsqfcwsaexnn1.jpg 360w&rdquo;}\&rdquo;\&lsquo;My
math teacher is low-key terrified of all of us,\&rsquo; the tween in my house
told us tonight at dinner. And then she explained
why.\&rdquo;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, apparently, about a month ago, the tween (who asks to be known to
you as Max) decided to start an active, participatory meme amongst the
entire seventh grade.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Save \$500 on bread this year -- click here!\&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max, who apparently has unnatural, cult-like leadership qualities,
persuaded a core group of friends to whisper this phrase to everyone
they saw at school one afternoon. And they complied. All the 40+ 7th
graders in her middle school.</p>
<p>How did she come up with this phrase? From the teeming maw of creative
chaos that is her brain. It\&rsquo;s not a reference to anything. It is
purely random. An act of reckless dadaism.</p>
<p>It took about a month for the phrase to achieve complete group
saturation. At the end of the month, one of the 7th graders -- Max
doesn\&rsquo;t know which one -- wrote this phrase down on a piece of
paper, and placed it on their math teacher\&rsquo;s desk before class one
day.</p>
<p>Now, at this point, it\&rsquo;s just funny in the normal way. Students
decide to confuse their teacher by flaunting an in-joke. Happens all
the time, I\&rsquo;m sure. Teachers get used to being mystified by their
students.</p>
<p>Max and the other 7th graders come into math class one day, and the
teacher puts the note up on the overhead projector.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Save \$500 on bread this year -- click here!\&rdquo;<br />
The children are silent.<br />
The teacher waits. Silence.<br />
He gestures toward the screen. \&ldquo;So...what does this mean?\&rdquo;<br />
The 7th graders burst into laughter.<br />
\&ldquo;No, seriously, one of you needs to explain this,\&rdquo; he says.<br />
And the class falls silent. Because... you know. There is no
explanation. Except that Max is both random and charismatic and
apparently they all do her bidding.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>Max stands up at her desk. She stands very straight and tall (she
demonstrated for me and her mom at the dinner table) and places one
hand behind her back.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Kind of like when you put your hand over your heart for the Pledge
of Allegiance,\&rdquo; she explains to us.</p>
<p>She then proceeds to read the note from off the overhead projector, in
a solemn, declamatory manner.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;SAVE \$500 ON BREAD THIS YEAR. CLICK HERE.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>(and keep in mind, this was, in no way orchestrated in advance)</p>
<p>all the other kids put their hand behind their back.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;At what point, exactly, did they do this?\&rdquo; I ask, when I can
breathe again after laughing for approximately 20 minutes.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;As soon as I said \&lsquo;click here\&lsquo;,\&rdquo; says Max.</p>
<p>The students are quiet. Staring at their math teacher. Max is still
standing. The teacher stares back. And then, quietly, Max sits back
down, and her followers resume normal posture.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;What did your teacher do then?\&rdquo; I ask, breathless with fascination
and admiration.</p>
<p>Apparently, he then phoned the front office to apprise them of the
situation.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Why did he call the office??\&rdquo; I ask, baffled.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;So they could call kids to the office and ask them questions.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&rdquo;...why?\&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Because it could be taken as a threat or some shit? I don\&rsquo;t know,
my school\&rsquo;s weird.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many adults in school administration see kids as chaotic elements that
must be rigidly controlled or else everything will fall to shit. Any
\&ldquo;unusual\&rdquo; behavior worries them and makes them act like tyrants.</p>
<p>But here is what is hilarious to me: The principal might ask
questions. They might get some kids to tell them that some other kid
passed them a note that said \&ldquo;Save \$500 on bread this year\&ldquo;. But
nobody -- nobody -- is going to be able to explain to the
administration or the teachers what happened that day. It wasn\&rsquo;t
planned. At all. Max was improvising the entire time, and the other
kids just...followed her lead.</p>
<p>Students passing a note around is normal. Students spontaneously
acting on the cue of one of their peers is not normal. Max is not
normal. Max is a fucking genius.</p>
<p>Even I might be willing to admit, from a school administration
standpoint, that it is slightly...concerning that one 12-year old can
effortlessly bend THE ENTIRE SEVENTH GRADE to her will.</p>
<p>But. <em>whispers</em> that\&rsquo;s the part of the story they\&rsquo;ll NEVER find out
about.</p>
<p>No matter what questions they ask, no matter who\&rsquo;s willing to talk to
them... what are those kids going to say? \&ldquo;Max did a thing, so...we
all just did the thing.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>They don\&rsquo;t know why they did it. MAX doesn\&rsquo;t know why they did it.
She doesn\&rsquo;t know why SHE did it.</p>
<p>Imagine a middle school administrator of average intelligence and no
particular creativity, trying to wrap their heads around this
situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I expect great things from Max.</em></p>
