<h1 id="photo-booth">Photo booth</h1>

<p>Date: 2015-04-23 06:36:57</p>

<p>I\&rsquo;ve been thinking of making another attempt at building a photo booth
for <a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/">DNA Lounge</a>.</p>

<p>I last tried this <a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2007/02/photobooth-doa/">back in
2007</a>, and gave up,
because back then, no cheap video cameras were good enough in low light,
and getting a Mac to remotely control a DSLR and then get images out of
it was basically impossible.</p>

<p>But hey, eight years later! And the world has changed so much that there
are not only a ton of people out there selling photo booths, but there
are a ton of people selling just the software to turn a DSLR, a printer
and a tent into a photo booth. With anim-GIFs.</p>

<p>The world has changed so much that there is a <a href="http://www.photoboothtalk.com/">Photo Booth
Expo</a>. Yes, there really is a convention
for everything.</p>

<p>So, Lazyweb, what do you know about this stuff?</p>

<p>Have you used photo booth software? Have you maintained a photo booth
and seen what happens upon contact with the enemy?</p>

<p>Which software, cameras and printers are any good? I guess I want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mac-based, not Windows;</li>
<li>Live video preview;</li>
<li>The preview works well enough in low light that the booth doesn\&rsquo;t
have to leak light all over the nightclub (a flash is ok, but a
constant-on 100 watt bulb is not);</li>
<li>Auto-upload all photos to our own web site;</li>
<li>A photo printer that can stand up to an extraordinary amount of
abuse;</li>
<li>Ability to take cash or credit cards to pay for the prints;</li>
<li>Is not going to require an operator to fuss with it multiple times a
night.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are lots of companies out there who will happily put a photo booth
inside your business, charge for the photos, and keep all of the money,
but if I\&rsquo;ve learned anything from owning my own ATMs and owning my own
ticketing service, it is this: <em>\&ldquo;never, ever do that.\&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The turnkey photo booths you can buy seem to go for \$8,000 to \$15,000,
which seems crazy for a fabric tent that has at best \$1,600 worth of
hardware and off-the-shelf software in it. But, maybe answering the
questions I asked above is harder than I think it is.</p>

<p>(If you are about to suggest running Apple\&rsquo;s \&ldquo;Photo Booth\&rdquo;
application then you are missing the point about how combat-hardened
this solution needs to be. In fact if you\&rsquo;re about to begin a sentence
with <em>\&ldquo;Why don\&rsquo;t you just...\&ldquo;,</em> please don\&rsquo;t, that means you
haven\&rsquo;t thought it through and you\&rsquo;re not helping.)</p>
