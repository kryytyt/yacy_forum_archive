<p><a href="http://blog.thinkst.com/p/if-nsa-has-been-hacking-everything-how.html?m=1"><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/pigeon-poop.jpg" alt="" />If the NSA has been
hacking everything, how has nobody seen them
coming?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the Snowden leaks continue to dribble out, it has become
increasingly obvious that most nations planning for \&ldquo;cyber-war\&rdquo; have
been merely sharpening knives for what looks like an almighty
gunfight. We have to ask ourselves a few tough questions, the biggest
of which just might be:</p>
<p>\&ldquo;If the NSA was owning everything in sight (and by all accounts they
have) then how is it that nobody ever spotted them?\&rdquo; [...]</p>
<p>We think that the following reasons help to explain how this mass
exploitation remained under the radar for so long:</p>
<ol>
<li>Amazing adherence to classification/secrecy oaths;</li>
<li>You thought they were someone else;</li>
<li>You were looking at the wrong level;</li>
<li>Some beautiful misdirection;</li>
<li>They were playing chess &amp; you were playing checkers;</li>
<li>Your \&ldquo;experts\&rdquo; failed you miserably.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This part is kind of amazing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We see the use of an entire new protocol, called FASHIONCLEFT to
effectively copy traffic off a network, attach metadata to it, then
hide the packet within another packet allowed to exfil the targeted
network.</p>
<p>Tunnelling one type of traffic over another is not novel (although a
27 page interface control document for the protocol is cool) but this
still leaves open the possibility that you would see victim_machine
talking to HOST_X in Europe. This is where passive collection comes
in..</p>
<p>This is beautiful! So the data is munged into any packet that is
likely to make it out of the network, and is then directed past a
passive collector. This means that we cant rely on the host the data
was sent to for attribution, and even if we did completely own the
last hop, to see who shows up to grab the data, we would be watching
in vain, because the deed was done when the packets traversed a
network 3 hops ago.</p>
<p>This really is an elegant solution and a beautiful sleight of hand.
With the NSA controlling tens of thousands of passive hosts scattered
around the Internet, good luck ever finding that smoking gun!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35672.pdf">FASHIONCLEFT</a>
is <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149">IP Over Avian Carriers</a>, NSA
Edition.</p>
<p>It\&rsquo;s a protocol for encapsulating hashed, possibly encrypted, packets
from other protocols inside a completely different protocol: you allow
outbound ssh (let\&rsquo;s say) so it dumps your internal network traffic onto
the end of legitimate ssh packets that were on their way out anyway!
I\&rsquo;m not entirely clear on whether this encapsulation is happening at
the transport layer (munging TCP packets) or the session layer (munging
in protocol-specific ways, like MPEG frames or something).</p>
<p>Those packets can be going <em>anywhere</em> and NSA will still be able to see
them all because they own the midpoint routers, passively inspecting
packets during transit. They\&rsquo;re using existing connections as
dead-drops, but the payload is copied before it even makes it to the
drop.</p>
<p>And it\&rsquo;s probably your BIOS that\&rsquo;s doing this. Good times.</p>
