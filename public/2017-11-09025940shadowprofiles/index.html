Facebook Figures Out Everyone You\&rsquo;ve Ever
Met:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shadow contact information has been a known feature of Facebook for a
few years now. But most users remain unaware of its reach and power.
Because shadow-profile connections happen inside Facebook\&rsquo;s
algorithmic black box, people can\&rsquo;t see how deep the data-mining of
their lives truly is, until an uncanny recommendation pops up.
[...]</p>
<p>Facebook warns users to be judicious about using all this data. \&ldquo;You
may have business or personal contacts in your phone,\&rdquo; the Learn More
screen admonishes the reader. \&ldquo;Please only send friend requests to
people you know personally who would welcome the invite.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having issued this warning, and having acknowledged that people in
your address book may not necessarily want to be connected to you,
Facebook will then do exactly what it warned you not to do. If you
agree to share your contacts, every piece of contact data you possess
will go to Facebook, and the network will then use it to try to search
for connections between everyone you know, no matter how slightly --
and you won\&rsquo;t see it happen. [...]</p>
<p>The existence of shadow contact information came to light in 2013
after Facebook admitted it had discovered and fixed \&ldquo;a bug.\&rdquo; The bug
was that when a user downloaded their Facebook file, it included not
just their friends\&rsquo; visible contact information, but also their
friends\&rsquo; shadow contact information.</p>
<p>The problem with the bug, for Facebook, was not that all the
information was lumped together -- it was that it had mistakenly
shown users the lump existed. The extent of the connections Facebook
builds around its users is supposed to be visible only to the company
itself.</p>

<p>If this sounds a lot like Equifax to you, then you are, like, some kind
of pattern-matching <em>machine:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/11/me_on_the_equif.html">Schneier\&rsquo;s Congressional testimony on
Equifax:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>3. There are thousands of data brokers with similarly intimate
information, similarly at risk.</p>
<p>Equifax is more than a credit reporting agency. It\&rsquo;s a data broker.
It collects information about all of us, analyzes it all, and then
sells those insights. It might be one of the biggest, but there are
2,500 to 4,000 other data brokers that are collecting, storing, and
selling information about us -- almost all of them companies you\&rsquo;ve
never heard of and have no business relationship with.</p>
<p>The breadth and depth of information that data brokers have is
astonishing. Data brokers collect and store billions of data elements
covering nearly every US consumer. Just one of the data brokers
studied holds information on more than 1.4 billion consumer
transactions and 700 billion data elements, and another adds more than
3 billion new data points to its database each month. [...]</p>
<p>4. These data brokers deliberately hide their actions, and make it
difficult for consumers to learn about or control their data.</p>
<p>If there were a dozen people who stood behind us and took notes of
everything we purchased, read, searched for, or said, we would be
alarmed at the privacy invasion. But because these companies operate
in secret, inside our browsers and financial transactions, we don\&rsquo;t
see them and we don\&rsquo;t know they\&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>Regarding Equifax, few consumers have any idea what the company knows
about them, who they sell personal data to or why. If anyone knows
about them at all, it\&rsquo;s about their business as a credit bureau, not
their business as a data broker. Their website lists 57 different
offerings for business: products for industries like automotive,
education, health care, insurance, and restaurants. [...]</p>
<p>6. The market cannot fix this because we are not the customers of data
brokers.</p>
<p>The customers of these companies are people and organizations who want
to buy information: banks looking to lend you money, landlords
deciding whether to rent you an apartment, employers deciding whether
to hire you, companies trying to figure out whether you\&rsquo;d be a
profitable customer -- everyone who wants to sell you something, even
governments.</p>
<p>Markets work because buyers choose from a choice of sellers, and
sellers compete for buyers. None of us are Equifax\&rsquo;s customers. None
of us are the customers of any of these data brokers. We can\&rsquo;t refuse
to do business with the companies. We can\&rsquo;t remove our data from
their databases. With few limited exceptions, we can\&rsquo;t even see what
data these companies have about us or correct any mistakes.</p>
<p>We are the product that these companies sell to their customers: those
who want to use our personal information to understand us, categorize
us, make decisions about us, and persuade us.</p>
