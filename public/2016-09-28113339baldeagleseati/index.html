<h1 id="bald-eagles-eating-chickens">Bald Eagles Eating Chickens</h1>

<p>Date: 2016-09-28 11:33:39</p>

<p><a href="http://www.audubon.org/magazine/fall-2016/an-organic-chicken-farm-georgia-has-become-endless"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/ealge-and-chicken.jpg" alt="" />In a battle
between a Bald Eagle and a chicken, the chicken is definitely the long
shot.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yet you can\&rsquo;t help but root for the eagle. It is a magnificent
creature, precision-built to do two things that reliably fill humans
with awe -- fly and kill -- and it looks completely at ease doing
both. Swooping down, the eagle unfurls its hand-like claws, scoops up
a chicken, and sweeps up to a tree, whereupon the larger bird lays the
smaller bird on a branch to allow for easy consumption. It\&rsquo;s unclear
exactly when the chicken dies, but the eagle\&rsquo;s beak is quite
effective at pulling out the other bird\&rsquo;s meat. After a few minutes,
all that remains is a clump of feathers and discarded viscera. These
gory leavings splatter anything below the tall oaks at White Oak
Pastures, a family farm in rural Georgia -- including, one morning,
Jenni Harris\&rsquo;s SUV.</p>

<p>Jenni\&rsquo;s father, Will Harris, the fourth-generation owner of White Oak
Pastures in the tiny town of Bluffton (population: 100), is laughing
as he tells me about the gut-drenched vehicle. Jenni was unperturbed,
he explains; she simply wiped the bloody goo off the windshield before
driving away.</p>

<p>What else could she do? The slaughter here is relentless. White Oak is
home to one of the largest pastured chicken flocks in the country; at
any given time, 60,000 birds wander the land in accordance with
pasture-raised parameters. As the next level beyond free-range, this
farm never contains its adult birds indoors, instead allowing them to
roam without restraint at all times. This also means that for the Bald
Eagles that showed up a few years ago, White Oak is an all-you-can-eat
buffet.</p>

<p>When I visited in January, at least 75 Bald Eagles were living on the
farm, where they overwinter October to March. At that time, Harris
estimated each raptor was killing up to four chickens a day, racking
up a total of at least \$1,000 in daily losses. Due to the birds\&rsquo;
protected status under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and
other federal laws, Harris had few options. He couldn\&rsquo;t kill them. He
could try to shoo them, but most methods would be costly and likely to
scare the chickens before the eagles.</p>
