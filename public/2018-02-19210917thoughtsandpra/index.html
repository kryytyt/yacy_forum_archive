<p>Since the New York Times seems to specialize in bemused puff-piece
profiles of nazis these days, it always surprises me when it gets its
head out of its butt and does actual data-driven reporting, like this
incredibly long calendar-based infographic full of un-checked
checkboxes:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/15/opinion/congress-gun-progress.html"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/768/2018/grab-20180219_114401.png" alt="" />{sizes=&ldquo;(max-width: 660px) 65vw, 47em&rdquo;
srcset=&ldquo;https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/768/2018/grab-20180219_114401.png 901w, https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/768/2018/grab-20180219_114401.png 768w, https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/640/2018/grab-20180219_114401.png 640w, https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/360/2018/grab-20180219_114401.png 360w&rdquo;}What
Congress Has Accomplished Since the Sandy Hook
Massacre:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than five years have passed since the shooting at Sandy Hook
Elementary School, where 20 children and six adults were killed. In
that time, dozens of gun control proposals have been introduced in
Congress attempting to fix glaring issues with gun safety and
regulation. More than 1,600 mass shootings have taken place in America
since then.</p>
<p>Here is a guide to what Congress has -- or, more accurately, has not
-- accomplished during this time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or this, from a few months ago:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/04/opinion/thoughts-prayers-nra-funding-senators.html">Thoughts and Prayers and NRA
Funding:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most Americans support stronger gun laws -- laws that would reduce
deaths. But Republicans in Congress stand in the way. [...] Below
are the top 10 career recipients of N.R.A. funding -- through
donations or spending to benefit the candidate -- among both current
House and Senate members, along with their statements about the Las
Vegas massacre. These representatives have a lot to say about it. All
the while, they refuse to do anything to avoid the next massacre.</p>
