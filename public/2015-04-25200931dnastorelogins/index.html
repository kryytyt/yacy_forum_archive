<p>Date: 2015-04-25 20:09:31</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/store/"><img src="http://www.dnalounge.com/store/merch-anim.gif" alt="" /></a>Let
me say up front that I\&rsquo;m not particularly asking for advice here, more
just whining out loud. Because where I have questions, I think I know
the answers to those questions and the answers are unpleasant.</p>

<p>So <a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/store/">DNA Lounge has an online store</a>,
where we sell tickets to all of our events (we sell a lot of those), and
a tiny amount of physical merch (like, a handful of shipments a month).</p>

<p>The store is a giant pile of PHP code that started out as the online
store for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001003185826/http://www.unspunrecords.com/order/%20">Unspun
Records</a>
in like 1997 or something. John and I have been beating on this pile of
shit ever since, and we\&rsquo;ve made it pretty secure, but it\&rsquo;s still a
pile of shit and every time I have to touch it, part of me dies inside.</p>

<p>But we operate our own store because giving a percentage of your sales
to someone else just to process checkouts for you is a sucker move.</p>

<p>It\&rsquo;s a pile of shit, but it\&rsquo;s <em>our</em> pile of shit.</p>

<p>Anyway, our checkout page is pretty damned simple: <a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/latest.html">calendar event
page</a> → put a ticket in
your <a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/order/">cart</a> → checkout → enter CC,
email, billing address → receive
<a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2010/07/25.html">candy</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn\&rsquo;t do all kinds of jQuery alpha-fades and slide things around
on you, like you uppity kids enjoy so much these days, but it works and
it\&rsquo;s easy to understand.</p>

<p>But wouldn\&rsquo;t it be nice if we had the option to save all of that for
you, and not make you enter your card and addresses every time? Yeah, it
would. Fun fact: internally, Amazon used to refer to the \&ldquo;one click
checkout\&rdquo; button as \&ldquo;The Money Vacuum\&ldquo;.</p>

<p>So, you know what I don\&rsquo;t want to do? Write a login and user management
system. Because it needs, at a bare minimum to be useful in this modern
world: create/edit saved CC, shipping and billing addresses, email;
verify email addresses any time they change; change passwords; emailed
password reset tokens; login throttling; log in with Facebook; prompt
for all the extra info that Facebook doesn\&rsquo;t provide; oh, and the
knowledge that the Facebook API gets rewritten from scratch every two
years.</p>

<p>I mean, none of that is rocket surgery, but man, I really just don\&rsquo;t
wanna.</p>

<p>So about a year ago, someone suggested
<a href="http://www.php-login.net/">\&ldquo;PHP-Login\&rdquo;</a> as something that might be
relatively small and easy to integrate with our existing pile of shit. I
looked at it for a minute, and the feature list sounded pretty nice, but
the thought of digging through someone else\&rsquo;s PHP code and deciding if
I thought it was secure enough to trust my own store with it sounded
really unpleasant, so I left it on my todo list and ignored it for
another year.</p>

<p>Well the other day I came back to it for a second look, and guess what?
In true Open Sores style, since the last time I looked at this project,
it has been <em>rewritten from scratch!</em> You didn\&rsquo;t see that coming, did
you? Yeah. You did. You really <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html">did</a>.
So now it\&rsquo;s called
<a href="https://github.com/panique/huge/blob/master/README.md">\&ldquo;Huge\&rdquo;</a>, which
is about the least confidence-inspiring name imaginable.</p>

<p>So I\&rsquo;m reading through the README, hoping against hope that what I read
will let me convince myself that this sounds like something I could
trust, and these are the gems that jump out at me from that reading:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is littered with smilies. I know I\&rsquo;m just an unfrozen caveman,
but that\&rsquo;s like dotting your eyes with hearts on a resumé.</p></li>

<li><p>With a straight face, and no emoticon, this piece of <em>security
software</em> suggests that you install it by doing <code>&quot;wget | sudo sh&quot;</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>I\&rsquo;m just gonna leave this here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Documentation</em></p>

<p>A real documentation is in the making. Until then, please have a
look at the code and use your IDE\&rsquo;s code completion features to
get an idea how things work, it\&rsquo;s quite obvious when you look at
the controller files, the model files and how data is shown in the
view files. A big sorry that there\&rsquo;s no documentation yet, but
time is rare :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully a real grammar is also making. Smiley not smiley.</p></li>

<li><p>Also: <em>\&ldquo;There\&rsquo;s no reason to complain (!) about free open-source
software.\&rdquo;</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Uh huh.</p>

<p>So I don\&rsquo;t mean to bust on this guy too much, because he\&rsquo;s being
honest about what this project is: it\&rsquo;s someone\&rsquo;s Learning Experience.
There\&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. Everyone\&rsquo;s got to learn somehow, and
writing things is the only way to do it. But that makes it a <em>toy,</em> not
a <em>product</em>.</p>

<p>And that means the answer to the question of, should anyone use this in
production, with actual money on the line, is: \&ldquo;are you insane?\&rdquo;</p>

<p>As learning experiences go, I know I\&rsquo;d trust <em>my</em> learning experience
more than someone else\&rsquo;s, but like I said, wow, I just really don\&rsquo;t
wanna. I know it would make my business better, but actually doing the
work sounds about as pleasant as a root canal.</p>

<p>I guess what I\&rsquo;m saying here is, everything is terrible.</p>
