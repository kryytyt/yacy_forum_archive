<p>Date: 2017-05-11 09:02:29</p>

<p><a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2017/05/06/7000-bodies-could-be-buried-beneath-ummc-campus/101216178/"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/636294226075542688-tclbrd-03-02-2014.jpg" alt="" />Up
to 7,000 bodies are buried on 20 acres of the University of Mississippi
Medical Center
campus.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are former patients of the state\&rsquo;s first mental institution,
called the Insane Asylum, built in 1855, and underground radar shows
their coffins stretch across 20 acres of the UMMC campus, where
officials have wanted to build. [...]</p>

<p>Before the asylum, those suffering from mental illness were chained in
jails and even attics, said Dr. Luke Lampton, chairman of the state
Board of Health. While the asylum provided a better place for
patients, life remained harsh. Of the 1,376 patients admitted between
1855 and 1877, more than one in five died.</p>

<p>After the Civil War ended, the facility expanded to house 300
patients, and the area became known as \&ldquo;Asylum Hill,\&rdquo; a neighborhood
that included houses, a school and Cade Chapel Missionary Baptist
Church, a church for former slaves. [...] At its height, about
6,000 patients stayed at the asylum, and the facility provided many
jobs to the area, which saw construction of a fertilizer factory, a
Baptist orphanage and a sanatorium for those suffering from
tuberculosis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow. This is a lot like saying, <em>\&ldquo;More than 6,000 \&lsquo;stayed\&rsquo; at the
prison, providing many jobs\&ldquo;,</em> or <em>\&ldquo;More than 6,000 African immigrants
\&lsquo;stayed\&rsquo; at the plantation, providing many jobs\&ldquo;.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zuckerman said one master\&rsquo;s student used genetic sequencing to
reconstruct oral bacteria from skeletons, shedding light on health
conditions at the time the individuals were alive. A second student
studied missing lines of tooth enamel, pointing to nutritional
deprivation and other severe stress. A third student found evidence in
asylum records and in skeletons of pellagra, a disease caused by
Vitamin B deficiency, which was extremely common in the South during
the early 20th century.</p>

<p>Zuckerman said records reflect up to 35,000 patients stayed at the
asylum between 1865 and 1935. She said a total of 9,000 died there,
with about 6,000 of them buried in the asylum cemetery.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1576877086/"><em>Malformed: Forgotten Brains of the Texas State Mental
Hospital</em></a> is an amazing
book that not only has some fantastically creepy photos, but also goes
into a lot of detail about what kind of horrible snakepits these sorts
of facilities were. It\&rsquo;s probably worse than you imagine, even if that
imagination is based solely on low budget horror movies.</p>
