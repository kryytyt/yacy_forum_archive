right\&rdquo; are
Nazis:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, for too long now, when we consider questions of race,
especially questions concerning the Black race, we have been framing
things in completely the wrong way. Instead of asking how we can make
reparations for slavery, colonialism, and Apartheid or how we can
equalize academic scores and incomes, we should instead be asking
questions like, \&ldquo;Does human civilization actually need the Black
race?\&rdquo; \&ldquo;Is Black genocide right?\&rdquo; and, if it is, \&ldquo;What would be
the best and easiest way to dispose of them?\&rdquo; With starting points
like this, wisdom is sure to flourish, enlightenment to dawn.</p>

Nazis:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>What happened to letting the other guy throw the first punch?</strong></p>

<p>Nazis don\&rsquo;t throw the first punch. Nazis burn the first Reichstag.</p>

<p><strong>What about dialogue?</strong></p>

<p>Dialogue is for reasonable people acting in good faith. Dialogue is
between two acceptable positions. \&ldquo;Taxes need to be raised\&rdquo; vs.
\&ldquo;taxes need to be lowered\&rdquo; is grounds for dialogue. \&ldquo;Taxes need to
be raised\&rdquo; vs. \&ldquo;Jews should be thrown in ovens\&rdquo; is grounds for a
beating.</p>

<p><strong>But isn\&rsquo;t this sinking to their level?</strong></p>

<p>That depends. After you punch the Nazi, do you espouse the tenets of
National Socialism?</p>

<p><strong>Isn\&rsquo;t this a slippery slope?</strong></p>

<p>After we defeated the Nazis in World War II, did we keep shooting
people or did the troops come home and start having babies?</p>

<p><strong>The second thing.</strong></p>

<p>There you go. The slippery slope argument is nine times out of ten
bullshit. Human beings are good with slippery slopes: we build stairs.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/puckett101/status/822903723164835840">Puckett:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>So no, I don\&rsquo;t feel bad that a white supremacist got punched in the
face. I don\&rsquo;t think dialogue is the solution. And I think those
things because I and people I know dealt with actual Nazis for years.
If you want to clutch your pearls, fine. If you want to understand the
flip side, talk to some folks from the ARA or a SHARP. Because old
punks are some of the only folks in America to have dealt with actual
Nazis on a regular basis.</p>

observes that not everyone loved the flag-draped hero, and that Simon &amp;
Kirby received threatening phone calls and anti-Semitic hate
mail:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another time, Jack took a call. A voice on the other end said, \&ldquo;There
are three of us down here in the lobby. We want to see the guy who
does this disgusting comic book and show him what real Nazis would do
to his Captain America.\&rdquo; To the horror of others in the office, Kirby
rolled up his sleeves and headed downstairs. The callers, however,
were gone by the time he arrived.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1977, when the American Nazis were planning to march on Skokie, my
family was really worried. Not about the march (well, sure about the
march, too) but mostly because my grandmother - who had survived
Auschwitz with damages from beatings that never healed, who had
received those beatings trying to save her 8 and 3 year old sons from
the lines when she realized what was going on, who had lost almost her
entire family - was gleefully talking about how she was going to buy
herself a gun and shoot herself a Nazi. There was no hand-wringing, or
irony, no way to get her to acknowledge that the people marching
weren\&rsquo;t the same Nazis - she didn\&rsquo;t care. This was her opportunity
and no one was sure how they would actually stop her from shooting
someone if she somehow managed to get a gun. Fortunately the march
fizzled and it never came up again.</p>

<p>I guess what I\&rsquo;m trying to say is, while I understand the \&lsquo;violence
never solves anything and can make things appreciably worse for those
of us fighting\&rsquo; argument, and while I am not sure I would ever have
it in me to punch a Nazi myself -- I\&rsquo;m not only 100% okay with this
punching, I would be glad to say that this one\&rsquo;s for my Bubbe.</p>

<p>Many of us, myself included, are socialized to be more outraged at
breaches of etiquette than breaches of justice. Etiquette is largely
about maintaining an unjust social order, where it\&rsquo;s worse for you to
tell your racist relatives to shut the fuck up at Thanksgiving than it
is for them to spew their nonsense where your little cousins can hear.
I\&rsquo;ve had it up to the eyes with respectability politics - we have
never gained anything by smiling and being polite and waiting for
others to recognize our humanity, and we won\&rsquo;t gain any ground by
trying to reason with people who want us dead, or enslaved, or sent to
conversion therapy, or marked permanently as second-class citizens in
some other way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, it is always correct to punch Nazis. They lost the right to not
be punched in the face when they started spouting genocidal ideologies
that in living memory killed millions upon millions of people. And
anyone who stands up and respectfully applauds their perfect right to
say these things should probably also be punched, because they are
clearly surplus to human requirements. Nazis do not need a hug. Nazis
do not need to be indulged. Their world doesn\&rsquo;t get better until
you\&rsquo;ve been removed from it. Your false equivalences mean nothing.
Their agenda is always, always, extermination. Nazis need a punch in
the face.</p>

<p><a href="https://pulsemedia.org/2017/01/22/in-defence-of-assaulting-fascists/">Robbing fascism of its virility and hyper masculine pretence is to rob
it of its primary capacity to grow and
survive.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this particular instance, we must utilize fear to our advantage.
The continuation of protests and the show of strength must not only
intimidate fascists, but also send a clear message to the three most
important institutions that fascists require for total power: big
business, media and state institutions. They must constantly fear any
form of collaboration with Trump\&rsquo;s administration. They must fear how
the nation\&rsquo;s history books will view them but to accomplish that we
must compel them to think that future historians will not be fascists.
The fascist future must be cancelled, today.</p>
