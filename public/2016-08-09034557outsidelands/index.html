<p>TL;DR: Hælos, LCD Soundsystem.</p>

<p>I didn\&rsquo;t do that thing where I post a photo of each band I enjoyed
because I just wasn\&rsquo;t feeling motivated, but here\&rsquo;s a summary of my
weekend:</p>

<p><strong>Friday:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Caveman:</strong> I caught the last few songs, and they were ok. They covered
<em>I Want to Be Adored</em>, which kind of violates the rule of \&ldquo;never remind
someone of a better band than yours\&rdquo; because now I\&rsquo;m just thinking
about Stone Roses instead of Caveman.</p>

<p><strong>Ra Ra Riot:</strong> I remember thinking they were decent, but don\&rsquo;t
remember them at all right now.</p>

<p><strong>St. Lucia:</strong> I\&rsquo;ve seen them a few times because I keep thinking,
\&ldquo;Wait, I like them, don\&rsquo;t I?\&rdquo; but they\&rsquo;re kind of a snore.</p>

<p><strong>Poliça:</strong> Their live show is much like their recorded material: it is
pleasant enough and it sounds like the kind of thing that is my kind of
thing, but I find my mind wandering about a minute into each song. It\&rsquo;s
like I\&rsquo;ve already forgotten them before the song is even over. They\&rsquo;re
like a sedative. I remember seeing them before, but for all I know I\&rsquo;ve
seen them ten times and just don\&rsquo;t remember.</p>

<p><strong>Låpsley:</strong> She was great. I had planned to stay for only a couple of
songs and the go see Duran Duran, but instead I stayed for her whole set
and missed them. Recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Grimes:</strong> She\&rsquo;s basically a DJ, and her attempt to put on a show that
justifies being in front of 20,000 people is to run around a lot and
bring out some dancers. Which is a fine approach, I guess, but the
dancers are of the \&ldquo;those are decent go-gos\&rdquo; skill level, not the
\&ldquo;this is a dance performance\&rdquo; level, or even the Peaches \&ldquo;what the
fuck was that\&rdquo; level.</p>

<p>(So at this point, Friday wasn\&rsquo;t looking so hot.)</p>

<p><strong>LCD Soundsystem:</strong> They were <em>absolutely incredible</em>. I\&rsquo;ve seen them
before, and they were... not incredible. But this time, they really
nailed it. Second best performance of the weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rogue Wave:</strong> They were pretty good.</p>

<p><strong>The Wombats:</strong> Awesome and really fun. I\&rsquo;ve seen them a couple times.</p>

<p><strong>Peaches:</strong> She\&rsquo;s a karaoke act, but she had several ridiculous
costumes and a couple of goofball dancers in giant vulvas and fetish
gear, and she really knows how to put on a show. Highly recommended on
the grounds that watching a complete lunatic on stage is always worth
your time.</p>

<p><strong>Halsey:</strong> I really like her album, and the show sounded <em>exactly</em> like
it. Like, so much like it that I wondered how much of it was canned, but
I suspect that really what\&rsquo;s going on is \&ldquo;highly produced album,
highly paid hired-gun session musicians on tour duplicating it.\&rdquo; So the
whole performance felt pretty flat, even though clearly Money Was Spent.</p>

<p>I\&rsquo;m kind of shocked she\&rsquo;s playing for this many people. When I heard
the album I thought, \&ldquo;Yup, this is another act we\&rsquo;re going to try and
book but lose to Rickshaw, where it\&rsquo;s going to sell 300 tickets.\&rdquo;
Nope, I\&rsquo;m off by almost two orders of magnitude. Apparently she\&rsquo;s on
some soundtracks? That\&rsquo;s how people who don\&rsquo;t like music discover
music.</p>

<p>She did have the best line of the festival though. It was <em>freezing</em>,
because it\&rsquo;s August, and she said, \&ldquo;San Francisco, I feel like we have
a lot in common -- my teeth are chattering, your teeth are
chattering... the difference is, I\&rsquo;m not on molly!\&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Radiohead:</strong> I still don\&rsquo;t understand why anyone anywhere gives a
shit about Radiohead. I mean, <em>Creep</em> was ok I guess? I just can\&rsquo;t
manage to care about them in the slightest, even enough to <em>dislike</em>
them. They\&rsquo;re just a test tone to me. But they are \&ldquo;geniuses\&rdquo; I am
told. Two songs during the long walk out was plenty for me.</p>

<p><strong>Sunday:</strong></p>

<p>I considered skipping Sunday entirely, but I\&rsquo;m glad I didn\&rsquo;t because I
got there just in time for <strong>Hælos</strong> and they were definitely the best
thing I saw all weekend. Like, I would have sat through the entire set
all over again. So, so great.</p>

<p><strong>Diiv:</strong> Also very good. I\&rsquo;ve been hearing about them for a while but
hadn\&rsquo;t seen them, and I\&rsquo;m glad I did.</p>

<p>And then I went home. The end.</p>
