<h1 id="next-economy-conference">Next Economy Conference</h1>

<p>Date: 2015-11-18 21:34:57</p>

<p><a href="https://storify.com/bnwlfsn/maciej-on-the-next-economy-conference">The twit snark is strong with this
one:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>From tennis lessons and stock reports to antiquing and booking a
private jet, technology is transforming everything about the way we
live</p>

<p>Currently topping the leaderboard for whitest rich dude statement:
\&ldquo;My dogs get mani-pedis; I don\&rsquo;t\&ldquo;. But it\&rsquo;s a competitive field</p>

<p>Next talk is a vision of connecting ubiquitous surveillance
technologies to a form letter generator. #nexteconomy</p>

<p>GE CEO talking about how they\&rsquo;re giving back to society by competing
worldwide and spreading good-old American know-how</p>

<p>GE CEO: it\&rsquo;s imporant that we not live in a society where meaningful
employment is precarious and limited to the lucky few. (just kidding)</p>

<p>Sign of how broken US spirit is that we can have a panel talk on
retail-level employment without anyone even imagining paid holiday
leave</p>

<p>Stage engulfed in sulfurous fumes as TaskRabbit founder materializes
in the flaming on-stage pentagram. This is getting good #nexteconomy</p>

<p>Our chimney sweeps are allowed to keep and sell the creosote they
scrape from their skin, making them small business owners!</p>

<p>Now we have a cabbie, Uber driver, and Lyft driver. This is like
discussing the Protestant reformation with Calvin, Luther and the Pope</p>

<p>Discussion of whether you can refuse passengers based on their
likelihood to puke actually a terrific analysis of driver agency and
power</p>

<p>Second-best part of conference is techies mansplaining on Twitter why
working a 60 hour week as an underpaid driver is a great livelihood</p>

<p>Cabbie (Kelly Dessaint) \&ldquo;The worst drivers in SF are tourists, and
most Uber and Lyft drivers are tourists. They live in Modesto,
Hayward...\&rdquo;</p>

<p><br />
VC is describing magical feeling of pressing button on his phone,
getting food. Lab rats have been living this dream for years</p>

<p>The trick is to not deliver the food every time the VC presses the
button. Intermittent reward ensures a hefty series B</p>

<p><br />
VCs now vehemently agreeing that the path to victory is pretend to be
a service without incurring any of the obligations of one</p>

<p>\&ldquo;If your idea isn\&rsquo;t big enough to warrant regulatory scrutiny, it
probably isn\&rsquo;t important enough.\&rdquo; This is the mentality of a toddler</p>

<p>We\&rsquo;re moving from a world of widespread unemployment to one where
people have three, four or even five jobs. #prosperity</p>

<p>The BART system is a dinosaur monopoly that should be deregulated so
private trains can run on it, too</p>

<p>Only at a San Francisco tech conference do you have to mount a basic
defense of the concept of government before proposing modest
regulation</p>

<p>Really nice to be hearing a VC getting worked up over low wages and
social cohesion instead of immortality and greening Mars</p>

<p>\&ldquo;Trickle-down economics is an intimidation tactic masquerading as
economic theory.\&rdquo; Best VC ever. Last against the wall.</p>

<p><br />
Fire alarm. Huge victory for the working class</p>

<p>O\&lsquo;Reilly and Hoffman on stage trying to deduce from first principles
whether fire alarm is real or can be safely ignored</p>

<p>Any journalist looking for the world\&rsquo;s easiest metaphor should get in
here ASAP</p>

<p>I never thought I would live to hear Tim O\&lsquo;Reilly say \&ldquo;I\&rsquo;m sorry
for the disruption\&ldquo;. But the heroic hotel fire alarm made it happen</p>

<p><br />
Recurring theme this morning is Minimum Viable Education, how to train
future tech professionals without the baggage of reading English lit</p>

<p>Counterintuitively, grinding up the top 10% of employees and feeding
them to the bottom 10% actually works better than the old way</p>

<p>\&ldquo;If the Soviets had proposed current US economic policy, we would
have sent the USS Iowa to the Baltic Sea\&rdquo;</p>

<p><br />
Lyft guy spent three years on public transit board in LA. \$2 bus fare
covers 30% of the ride, rest comes from subsidies, which are dying</p>

<p>Paraphrasing him, \&ldquo;how do we make Los Angeles more like Botswana?\&ldquo;.
So many people traveling abroad have been struck by maxi-taxis market</p>

<p>Based on my experiences in collective taxis in Moldova, there\&rsquo;s a
huge synergy with reconstructive dentistry</p>

<p><br />
\&ldquo;Why is it that I always get the whole person when I want the pair of
hands?\&rdquo; - Henry Ford. Back when the US knew how to manufacture
villains</p>

<p>Now Ev is talking about his investment in a diamond manufacturer, and
next-generation fake meat</p>

<p>We\&rsquo;re high above the atmosphere now talking about abstractions. I
have no idea what anyone is saying.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;Who are the people you want your customers to become?\&rdquo; is such an
American phrase it might as well have little flags flying out of it</p>
