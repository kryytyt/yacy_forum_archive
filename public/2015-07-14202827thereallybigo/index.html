<p>Date: 2015-07-14 20:28:27</p>

<p>This is some really nicely written disaster porn.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one"><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/150720_r26752-320.jpg" alt="" />\&ldquo;Everything west
of Interstate 5 will be toast. The inundation zone will be scoured of
structures from California to
Canada.\&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If, on that occasion, only the southern part of the Cascadia
subduction zone gives way, the magnitude of the resulting quake will
be somewhere between 8.0 and 8.6. That\&rsquo;s the big one. If the entire
zone gives way at once, an event that seismologists call a full-margin
rupture, the magnitude will be somewhere between 8.7 and 9.2. That\&rsquo;s
the very big one.</p>

<p>When the next very big earthquake hits, the northwest edge of the
continent, from California to Canada and the continental shelf to the
Cascades, will drop by as much as six feet and rebound thirty to a
hundred feet to the west -- losing, within minutes, all the elevation
and compression it has gained over centuries. Some of that shift will
take place beneath the ocean, displacing a colossal quantity of
seawater. The water will surge upward into a huge hill, then promptly
collapse. One side will rush west, toward Japan. The other side will
rush east, in a seven-hundred-mile liquid wall that will reach the
Northwest coast, on average, fifteen minutes after the earthquake
begins. By the time the shaking has ceased and the tsunami has
receded, the region will be unrecognizable. Kenneth Murphy, who
directs FEMA\&rsquo;s Region X, the division responsible for Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, and Alaska, says, \&ldquo;Our operating assumption is
that everything west of Interstate 5 will be toast.\&rdquo; [...]</p>

<p>In fact, the science is robust, and one of the chief scientists behind
it is Chris Goldfinger. Thanks to work done by him and his colleagues,
we now know that the odds of the big Cascadia earthquake happening in
the next fifty years are roughly <strong><em>one in three.</em></strong> The odds of the
very big one are roughly <strong><em>one in ten.</em></strong> Even those numbers do not
fully reflect the danger -- or, more to the point, how unprepared the
Pacific Northwest is to face it. The truly worrisome figures in this
story are these: Thirty years ago, no one knew that the Cascadia
subduction zone had ever produced a major earthquake. Forty-five years
ago, no one even knew it existed. [...]</p>

<p>Four to six minutes after the dogs start barking, the shaking will
subside. For another few minutes, the region, upended, will continue
to fall apart on its own. Then the wave will arrive, and the real
destruction will begin.</p>

<p>Those who cannot get out of the inundation zone under their own power
will quickly be overtaken by a greater one. A grown man is knocked
over by ankle-deep water moving at 6.7 miles an hour. The tsunami will
be moving more than twice that fast when it arrives. Its height will
vary with the contours of the coast, from twenty feet to more than a
hundred feet. It will not look like a Hokusai-style wave, rising up
from the surface of the sea and breaking from above. It will look like
the whole ocean, elevated, overtaking land. Nor will it be made only
of water -- not once it reaches the shore. It will be a five-story
deluge of pickup trucks and doorframes and cinder blocks and fishing
boats and utility poles and everything else that once constituted the
coastal towns of the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>To see the full scale of the devastation when that tsunami recedes,
you would need to be in the international space station. The
inundation zone will be scoured of structures from California to
Canada. The earthquake will have wrought its worst havoc west of the
Cascades but caused damage as far away as Sacramento.</p>

<p>Hey, remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service_bulletin_for_New_Orleans_region#Bulletin_text">that
time</a>
the National Weather Service put out a bulletin about \&ldquo;HUMAN SUFFERING
INCREDIBLE BY MODERN STANDARDS\&ldquo;? Yeah, good times.</p>
