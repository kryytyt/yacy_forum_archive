<p><a href="https://medium.com/life-learning/work-hard-live-well-ead679cb506d"><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/1_h_pnw6kj8fxrgbipuzod3q.png" alt="" />Many people
believe that weekends and the 40-hour workweek are some sort of great
compromise between capitalism and
hedonism.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>You might think: but if you had prioritized those things, wouldn\&rsquo;t
your contributions have been reduced? Would Facebook have been less
successful?</p>

<p>Actually, I believe I would have been more effective: a better leader
and a more focused employee. I would have had fewer panic attacks, and
acute health problems  --  like throwing out my back regularly in my
early 20s. I would have picked fewer petty fights with my peers in the
organization, because I would have been generally more centered and
self-reflective. I would have been less frustrated and resentful when
things went wrong, and required me to put in even more hours to deal
with a local crisis. In short, I would have had more energy and spent
it in smarter ways... AND I would have been happier. That\&rsquo;s why this
is a true regret for me: I don\&rsquo;t feel like I chose between two worthy
outcomes. No, I made a foolish sacrifice on both sides. [...]</p>

<p>Many people believe that weekends and the 40-hour workweek are some
sort of great compromise between capitalism and hedonism, but that\&rsquo;s
not historically accurate. They are actually the carefully considered
outcome of profit-maximizing research by Henry Ford in the early part
of the 20th century. He discovered that you could actually get more
output out of people by having them work fewer days and fewer hours.
Since then, other researchers have continued to study this phenomenon,
including in more modern industries like game development.</p>

<p>The research is clear: beyond ~40 -- 50 hours per week, the marginal
returns from additional work decrease rapidly and quickly become
negative. We have also demonstrated that though you can get more
output for a few weeks during \&ldquo;crunch time\&rdquo; you still ultimately pay
for it later when people inevitably need to recover. If you try to
sustain crunch time for longer than that, you are merely creating the
illusion of increased velocity. This is true at multiple levels of
abstraction: the hours worked per week, the number of consecutive
minutes of focus vs. rest time in a given session, and the amount of
vacation days you take in a year.</p>
