<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/03/election-hackers-russia-cyberattack-voting-242266"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/cok7bw1xyaaapod.jpg" alt="" />Cash-strapped states
brace for Russian hacking
fight:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, some in the Capitol are trying to defund the 15-year-old
federal agency that helps states and counties administer elections.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which has three
full-time staffers examining elections, would also see budget cuts in
the pending congressional spending bills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Three! A whopping <em>three!</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The biggest financial need is replacing voting machines. Flush with
Help America Vote Act money in the early 2000s, states purchased new
machines, with many opting for electronic touchscreen devices for the
first time. But by now, 43 states rely on at least some electronic
machines that are more than 10 years old, according to the Brennan
Center.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;That kind of gear you usually figure should have a lifespan of eight
years, maybe 10,\&rdquo; said Menzel, of the Illinois election board. \&ldquo;Most
of it\&rsquo;s been running 10 years, maybe 12.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreover, election security experts say these aging machines are
riddled with flaws, and warn that electronic devices that leave no
paper trail make it impossible to check the results against a physical
vote count. At least four competitive states in the 2016 election
still used paperless electronic voting machines. [...]</p>

<p>Election security experts and many Democrats fear that all this
deliberation will be for naught unless security advocates can persuade
President Donald Trump to act.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;Any other Republican president might be easier to communicate
with,\&rdquo; said Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), a House Intelligence
Committee member backing an amendment to restore EAC funding. \&ldquo;This
one now believes any discussion about how the election was operated is
through the prism of questioning the validity of the election. I
desperately want to get past that.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.startribune.com/cybersecurity-experts-were-blocked-in-their-push-to-patch-voting-systems-in-2016/442172573/"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/diebold_15a.jpg" alt="" /> Cybersecurity experts
were blocked in their push to patch voting systems in
2016:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their five-page list of recommendations focused on two gaping holes in
the U.S. election system. It warned that internet voting by at least
some citizens in 32 states was not secure and should be avoided. And,
critically, it advised how to guard voting and ballot-counting
machines that the experts knew could be penetrated even when
disconnected from the internet.</p>

<p>But the list was stopped in its tracks. A year later, even as U.S.
intelligence agencies warn that Russian operatives have their eyes on
2018 and beyond, America\&rsquo;s more than 7,000 election jurisdictions
nationwide still do not have access to those guidelines for shielding
the voting process. [...]</p>

<p>A decade ago, when Congress tried to enact the most obvious solution
to that problem -- a law requiring all electronic voting machines to
have a \&ldquo;verifiable paper trail\&rdquo; -- state and local officials
largely opposed it.</p>

<p>Beyond the voting machines themselves, other dangers lurk: Scott, of
the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology, said his group
warned NASS last year that bad actors were likely to try to infect
vote-tallying equipment through vendors.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;We told them and we told them,\&rdquo; he said. \&ldquo;We showed them two
schematics of exactly where the attacks would come from\&rdquo; months
before the election.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/us/politics/russia-election-hacking.html">Russian Election Hacking Efforts, Wider Than Previously Known, Draw
Little
Scrutiny:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The assaults on the vast back-end election apparatus --
voter-registration operations, state and local election databases,
e-poll books and other equipment -- have received far less attention
than other aspects of the Russian interference, such as the hacking of
Democratic emails and spreading of false or damaging information about
Mrs. Clinton. Yet the hacking of electoral systems was more extensive
than previously disclosed, The New York Times found. [...]</p>

<p>Intelligence officials in January reassured Americans that there was
no indication that Russian hackers had altered the vote count on
Election Day, the bottom-line outcome. But the assurances stopped
there. Government officials said that they intentionally did not
address the security of the back-end election systems, whose
disruption could prevent voters from even casting ballots. [...]</p>

<p>The Russians shied away from measures that might alter the
\&ldquo;tallying\&rdquo; of votes, the report added, a conclusion drawn from
American spying and intercepts of Russian officials\&rsquo; communications
and an analysis by the Department of Homeland Security, according to
the current and former government officials.</p>

<p>The most obvious way to rig an election -- controlling hundreds or
thousands of decentralized voting machines -- is also the most
difficult. [...] Beginning in 2015, the American officials said,
Russian hackers focused instead on other internet-accessible targets:
computers at the Democratic National Committee, state and local voter
databases, election websites, e-poll book vendors and other back-end
election services.</p>

<p>Apart from the Russian influence campaign intended to undermine Mrs.
Clinton and other Democratic officials, the impact of the quieter
Russian hacking efforts at the state and county level has not been
widely studied. Federal officials have been so tight-lipped that not
even many election officials in the 21 states the hackers assaulted
know whether their systems were compromised, in part because they have
not been granted security clearances to examine the classified
evidence.</p>

<p>The January intelligence assessment implied that the Russian hackers
had achieved broader access than has been assumed. Without
elaborating, the report said the Russians had \&ldquo;obtained and
maintained access to multiple U.S. state and local election boards.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can\&rsquo;t believe I\&rsquo;ve been posting about the pathetic state of voting
security for <em>fourteen years</em> now.</p>
