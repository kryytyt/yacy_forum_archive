takes down data and thousands of posts, obscuring reach of Russian
disinformation</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Social media analyst Jonathan Albright got a call from Facebook the
day after he published research last week showing that the reach of
the Russian disinformation campaign was almost certainly larger than
the company had disclosed. While the company had said 10 million
people read Russian-bought ads, Albright had data suggesting that the
audience was at least double that -- and maybe much more -- if
ordinary free Facebook posts were measured as well.</p>

<p>Albright welcomed the chat with three company officials. But he was
not pleased to discover that they had done more than talk about their
concerns regarding his research. They also had scrubbed from the
Internet nearly everything -- thousands of Facebook posts and the
related data -- that had made the work possible.</p>

<p>Never again would he or any other researcher be able to run the kind
of analysis he had done just days earlier.</p>

Transparent</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Twitter pledged to do better in such situations, noting \&ldquo;we will be
clearer about these policies and decisions in the future.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>For close observers of Twitter\&rsquo;s opaque harassment rules and its
inconsistent enforcement of them this is a familiar dance. That\&rsquo;s
because Twitter wants everyone to know it is committed to
transparency. It is also committed to committing to being committed to
transparency.</p>

<p>Twitter was committed to transparency last month when it refused to
clarify its stance toward president Donald Trump\&rsquo;s tweets about North
Korea, which the country said it viewed as an \&ldquo;act of war.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>Twitter affirmed its commitment to transparency 4 times last month in
a blog post summarizing its Russian election interference testimony
before congress. Sen. Mark Warner described Twitter\&rsquo;s presentation as
\&ldquo;inadequate\&rdquo; in almost every way.</p>

<p>In January of this year, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey pledged to be more
open and transparent about addressing the company\&rsquo;s decade long
battle with systemic harassment on its platform.</p>

<p>This summer -- despite reports that repeat harassment victims were
still finding their abuse reports wrongly dismissed -- Twitter
affirmed its commitment to greater transparency.</p>

<p>That same month, when BuzzFeed News presented the company with 27
explicit examples of harassment, Twitter replied with its boilerplate
statement. And company co-founder Biz Stone promised the company would
be more transparent.</p>

<p>This is likely because Twitter has a history of committing to being
more transparent.</p>

<p>Like in 2015, when Dorsey apologized to developers for Twitter\&rsquo;s past
restrictions of third-party apps and pledged to be more transparent.</p>

<p>Similar to the kind of transparency the company promised in 2015 when
Twitter began making federal campaign contributions.</p>

<p>Transparency, you see, is part of Twitter\&rsquo;s 10-year plan.</p>

<p>But Twitter is committed to openness and clarity. Pledging a
commitment to transparency is one of the things Twitter does best.</p>

<p>Perhaps that\&rsquo;s because the company has been doing it since 2008.</p>
