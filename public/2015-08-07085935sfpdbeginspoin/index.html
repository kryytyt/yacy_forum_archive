say I need to get from downtown to Golden Gate Park by bike this
weekend. What\&rsquo;s my best route that avoids the Wiggle and the Panhandle
and Captain Douchenozzle\&rsquo;s pointless stake-out? (That isn\&rsquo;t, you know,
a 30Â° angle.)</p>
<p>Second question: where\&rsquo;s the most effective place I can spend money in
order to get this jackass reassigned?</p>
<p><a href="http://sf.streetsblog.org/2015/08/05/sfpd-park-station-begins-pointless-harassment-of-bike-commuters/">SFPD Park Station Begins Pointless Harassment of Bike
Commuters</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>SFPD Park Station Captain John Sanford has made good on his promise:
Officers were out this morning ticketing bike commuters who failed to
comply with a strict application of the stop sign law on Page Street
and the Wiggle. One bike rider said police justified her ticket by
adding their own fictional flourish to the law.</p>
<p>Laura Kiniry, 41, said she canceled a doctor appointment she was
biking to after receiving a \$234 ticket (plus court fees) because she
didn\&rsquo;t put her foot down after climbing uphill on Central Street to
make a left onto Page.</p>
<p>Kiniry, who has biked in the city for 18 years, said she saw two
people on bikes already pulled over by police at Page and Baker. She
assumed she wouldn\&rsquo;t receive a traffic citation for making a safe,
practical near-stop after pedaling uphill at single-digit speeds.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Maybe I didn\&rsquo;t come to a complete stop. I looked both ways,\&rdquo; said
Kiniry. She said the officer told her, \&rdquo;\&lsquo;You have to have at least
one of your feet down.\&rsquo;\&rdquo; That supposed requirement appears nowhere
in the California Vehicle Code. [...]</p>
<p>In an email exchange shared with Streetsblog, Inner Sunset resident
Sean Rea told Park Captain Sanford that he is \&ldquo;willfully disregarding
statistical evidence that proves the majority of injury accidents are
caused by motorists -- not by pedestrians or cyclists.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanford has said the bike crackdown is a response to complaints rather
than data. So Rea wrote multiple emails to report run-ins he\&rsquo;d had
with reckless drivers while bicycling. Here\&rsquo;s one example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twice this week I was cut off by drivers who failed to yield to me.
In both cases, [an] SFPD patrol car was behind me and had complete
visibility of the situation. I was able to talk to each patrol car
at the next red light and when I asked why they didn\&rsquo;t cite the
driver, both said something to the extent of \&ldquo;well, you\&rsquo;re OK,
right?\&ldquo;.</p>
<p>This seems like a stark double standard to me. Drivers can put me at
risk but as long as they don\&rsquo;t hurt me they won\&rsquo;t get cited. Yet
when cyclists make small infractions that don\&rsquo;t result in injury
the response from you is a crackdown.</p>
