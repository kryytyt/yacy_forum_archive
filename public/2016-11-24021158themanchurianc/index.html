<p><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/cok7bw1xyaaapod.jpg" alt="" />Hey, remember that
time the KGB got their goon elected President of the United States?
It\&rsquo;s like if in <em>The Manchurian Candidate</em>, Laurence Harvey was going
around saying \&ldquo;Chairman Mao is a good friend of mine, he\&rsquo;s got some
great ideas. Yuge ideas.\&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/world/europe/trump-campaign-russia.html?_r=3">Russian Officials Were in Contact With Trump Allies, Diplomat
Says</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>MOSCOW -- The Russian government maintained contacts with members of
Donald J. Trump\&rsquo;s \&ldquo;immediate entourage\&rdquo; during the American
presidential campaign, one of Russia\&rsquo;s top diplomats said Thursday.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;There were contacts,\&rdquo; Sergei A. Ryabkov, the deputy foreign
minister, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. \&ldquo;We
continue to do this and have been doing this work during the election
campaign,\&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryabkov said officials in the Russian Foreign Ministry were
familiar with many of the people he described as Mr. Trump\&rsquo;s
entourage. \&ldquo;I cannot say that all, but a number of them maintained
contacts with Russian representatives,\&rdquo; Mr. Ryabkov said.</p>

Ballots.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How might a foreign government hack America\&rsquo;s voting machines to
change the outcome of a presidential election? Here\&rsquo;s one possible
scenario. First, the attackers would probe election offices well in
advance in order to find ways to break into their computers. Closer to
the election, when it was clear from polling data which states would
have close electoral margins, the attackers might spread malware into
voting machines in some of these states, rigging the machines to shift
a few percent of the vote to favor their desired candidate. This
malware would likely be designed to remain inactive during
pre-election tests, do its dirty business during the election, then
erase itself when the polls close. A skilled attacker\&rsquo;s work might
leave no visible signs  --  though the country might be surprised
when results in several close states were off from pre-election polls.</p>
<p>Could anyone be brazen enough to try such an attack? A few years ago,
I might have said that sounds like science fiction, but 2016 has seen
unprecedented cyberattacks aimed at interfering with the election.
[...] In all these cases, Federal agencies publicly asserted that
senior officials in the Russian government commissioned these attacks.
[...]</p>
<p>The only way to know whether a cyberattack changed the result is to
closely examine the available physical evidence  --  paper ballots
and voting equipment in critical states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and
Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, nobody is ever going to examine that
evidence unless candidates in those states act now, in the next
several days, to petition for recounts.</p>

a recount in Wisconsin, Michigan and
Pennsylvania.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;After a divisive and painful presidential race, reported hacks into
voter and party databases and individual email accounts were causing
many [Americans] to wonder if our election results are reliable,\&rdquo;
Stein said in the statement. \&ldquo;These concerns need to be investigated
before the 2016 presidential election is certified.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Electronic voting machines have been a slow motion apocalypse for
<em>decades</em>. It would be really ironic if Jill Stein ended up helping to
keep Trump out of the White House, but hey, I\&rsquo;ll take it.
<a href="https://www.change.org/p/demand-an-audit-of-the-2016-presidential-election">Petition</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/hillary-clinton-s-popular-vote-lead-now-over-two-million-n687701">As additional votes have been counted in the presidential election,
especially on the West Coast, Hillary Clinton\&rsquo;s national popular-vote
lead over Donald Trump now exceeds 2 million
votes.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To put that popular-vote margin into perspective, Al Gore\&rsquo;s
popular-vote lead over George W. Bush in 2000 - when Bush won the
Electoral College - was 547,000 votes. Also noteworthy: Clinton\&rsquo;s
64-plus million votes is nearing in on the 65.9 million Barack Obama
won in 2012.</p>
<p>Of course, presidents are elected by the Electoral College, not the
popular vote, and what sunk Clinton\&rsquo;s campaign was her performance in
the key battleground states, particularly in the Midwest. And by
Wasserman\&rsquo;s count, Trump beat Clinton in 13 key swing states by a
48.5%-to-46.6% margin. In the non-swing states, though, Clinton is
ahead of Trump 48.9%-to-45.6%.</p>

He

exceptional, and that there are alternatives to full recounts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/15/trumps-flip-flop-on-the-electoral-college-from-disaster-to-genius/">Interestingly, Trump has deleted a number of tweets he sent in 2012,
including:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;He [Obama] lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election. We
should have a revolution in this country!\&rdquo;\&rsquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;The phoney [sic] electoral college made a laughing stock out of
our nation. The loser one!\&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;More votes equals a loss...revolution!\&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;This election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a
democracy!\&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet on Tuesday, Trump tweeted:</p>
<p>\&ldquo;The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all
states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much
different!\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://thinkprogress.org/2016-a-case-study-in-voter-suppression-258b5f90ddcd#.m75ooannc">Republicans were wildly successful at suppressing voters in 2016. Three
GOP-controlled states demonstrate the effectiveness of disenfranchising
the
opposition.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week, the first election in 50 years without the full protection
of the federal Voting Rights Act propelled Donald Trump to the White
House. [...] There has been relatively little discussion about the
millions of people who were eligible to vote but could not do so
because they faced an array of newly-enacted barriers to the ballot
box.</p>
<p>Their systematic disenfranchisement was intentional and politically
motivated. In the years leading up to 2016, Republican governors and
state legislatures implemented new laws restricting when, where, and
how people could vote -- laws that disproportionately harmed
students, the poor, and people of color. In several instances,
lawmakers pushing such policies said explicitly that their goal was
suppression of voters who favor the Democratic Party. [...]</p>
<p>Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed Wisconsin\&rsquo;s strict voter ID law
in 2011, and it has been tied up in court battles for years. A federal
court held that the law unconstitutionally burdens low-income people
of color, but ultimately the Supreme Court allowed it to go into
effect for the 2016 election. [...]</p>
<p>Federal courts struck down most of the [North Carolina] law after
finding that it was passed with the intention to suppress
African-American voters \&ldquo;with almost surgical precision.\&rdquo; [...]
Republican-controlled county elections boards tried to find a way
around the verdict. No longer able to cut a full week of early voting,
the state GOP instructed the boards to make \&ldquo;party line changes to
early voting\&rdquo;: cutting hours and locations. [...]</p>
<p>In the final weeks leading up to the election, voting rights groups
discovered that Wisconsin officials at local DMV offices were giving
false information to voters attempting to get the proper ID, putting
those officials in violation of a federal court order. [...]</p>
<p>In total, roughly 1.5 million Florida residents (almost 2.5 percent of
the state\&rsquo;s population) are disenfranchised because of the law, which
white lawmakers designed in the years after the Civil War in a
deliberate attempt to dilute the voting power of freed slaves. This
year, one in four of Florida\&rsquo;s black residents could not cast a
ballot.</p>
