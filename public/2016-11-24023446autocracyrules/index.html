Several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that
Hitler\&rsquo;s anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and
that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch
masses of followers and keep them aroused, enthusiastic, and in line for
the time when his organization is perfected and sufficiently powerful to
be employed effectively for political purposes.\&rdquo;

Survival</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>However well-intentioned, this talk assumes that Trump is prepared to
find common ground with his many opponents, respect the institutions
of government, and repudiate almost everything he has stood for during
the campaign. In short, it is treating him as a \&ldquo;normal\&rdquo; politician.
[...]</p>
<p>But Trump is anything but a regular politician and this has been
anything but a regular election. [...] He is probably the first
candidate in history to win the presidency despite having been shown
repeatedly by the national media to be a chronic liar, sexual
predator, serial tax-avoider, and race-baiter who has attracted the
likes of the Ku Klux Klan. Most important, Trump is the first
candidate in memory who ran not for president but for autocrat -- and
won.</p>
<p>I have lived in autocracies most of my life, and have spent much of my
career writing about Vladimir Putin\&rsquo;s Russia. I have learned a few
rules for surviving in an autocracy and salvaging your sanity and
self-respect. It might be worth considering them now:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule #1:</strong> <em>Believe the autocrat.</em> He means what he says.
Whenever you find yourself thinking, or hear others claiming, that
he is exaggerating, that is our innate tendency to reach for a
rationalization. This will happen often: humans seem to have
evolved to practice denial when confronted publicly with the
unacceptable. Back in the 1930s, <em>The New York Times</em>
<a href="http://www.snopes.com/1922-new-york-times-hitler/">assured</a> its
readers that Hitler\&rsquo;s anti-Semitism was all posture. [...]</li>
<li><strong>Rule #2:</strong> <em>Do not be taken in by small signs of normality.</em>
[...] Confronted with political volatility, the markets become
suckers for calming rhetoric from authority figures. So do people.
Panic can be neutralized by falsely reassuring words [...]</li>
<li><strong>Rule #3:</strong> <em>Institutions will not save you.</em> It took Putin a
year to take over the Russian media and four years to dismantle
its electoral system; the judiciary collapsed unnoticed. The
capture of institutions in Turkey has been carried out even
faster, by a man once celebrated as the democrat to lead Turkey
into the EU. Poland has in less than a year undone half of a
quarter century\&rsquo;s accomplishments in building a constitutional
democracy. [...]</li>
<li><strong>Rule #4:</strong> <em>Be outraged.</em> If you follow Rule #1 and believe
what the autocrat-elect is saying, you will not be surprised. But
in the face of the impulse to normalize, it is essential to
maintain one\&rsquo;s capacity for shock. This will lead people to call
you unreasonable and hysterical, and to accuse you of
overreacting. It is no fun to be the only hysterical person in the
room. Prepare yourself. [...]</li>
<li><strong>Rule #5:</strong> <em>Don\&rsquo;t make compromises.</em> Like Ted Cruz, who made
the journey from calling Trump \&ldquo;utterly amoral\&rdquo; and a
\&ldquo;pathological liar\&rdquo; to endorsing him in late September to
praising his win as an \&ldquo;amazing victory for the American
worker,\&rdquo; Republican politicians have fallen into line.
Conservative pundits who broke ranks during the campaign will
return to the fold. Democrats in Congress will begin to make the
case for cooperation, for the sake of getting anything done -- or
at least, they will say, minimizing the damage. [...]</li>
</ul>
