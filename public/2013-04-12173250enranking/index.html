==Define ranking rules in YaCy==\
\
\[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking Ranking\] is the technical
instance of \[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance relevance\], which
is \'what the user thinks is important\'. Since almost every user has a
different opinion about such \'relevance\' it should be possible to
define a personal ranking for a personal relevance. Also in different
search environments the ranking should change, i.e. within a site-only
search the user expects more in-depth results in contrast to popular
documents in unlimited internet search.\
\
A ranking can be done by the application of coefficients to document
attributes. Such attributes can be various counts, like a count of
words, bytes, outbound links, inbound links (from same or other domains)
and so on. There is a large number of such attributes in YaCy. To see
them all, open localhost:8090/IndexControlURLs\_p.html in your YaCy
peer. The ranking is done using Solr ranking methods. If your peer does
a remote search, then also your own ranking configuration is applied to
the remote peer. The configuration interface for this is in
http://localhost:8090/RankingSolr\_p.html\
\
For a distributed search in YaCy there is a special challenge: some
results from other peers may be returned without this rich set of
attributes. They return a so-called Reverse Word Index References
containing a small set of attributes. To combine search results from
other peers, they must be ranked using this subset of attributes. We
call that process \'post-ranking\'. The configuration interface for this
is in http://localhost:8090/RankingRWI\_p.html. If you use YaCy for a
portal search or intranet search without p2p mode, then you don\'t need
to care about it.\
\
===Solr Ranking in /RankingSolr\_p.html===\
The default ranking in Solr is done using \'boosts\' on search fields.
You can define which fields in the index Schema can be searched when you
submit a search and how strong they are boosted on every field using the
\"Solr Boosts\" section within /RankingSolr\_p.html. If you would like
to have search results, which have matches with your search word in a
specific field higher, then increase the boost value for that specific
field. Each field will produce a ranking value and the resulting ranking
score will be the sum of these boosted fields multiplied with a norming
factor which is the inverse of the square root of the sum of squared
weights.\
\
The boosted field ranking is just a formula for the relevancy of the
search hit regarding the text content and construction of the document,
but not for the topology of the document within the searched document
set. To influence the ranking your can use Boost Queries and Boost
Functions.\
\
A Boost Query is a query that is attached to the other queries that YaCy
calculates from the boost field configuration. It can be considered as a
default, fixed add-on to a search. The purpose is, to boost specific
attributes within the index schema. By default, we set this to\
fuzzy\_signature\_unique\_b:true\^100000.0\
Which boost a field which assignes that a document is unique. This moves
double content to the back. You can use this like a default filter for
your documents which move forward or backward in the result list
independently from the searched word.\
\
A Boost Function is a formula which evaluates attributes which are not
search fields. You can use this i.e. to evaluate the date fields (for a
date ordering) or to move documents with a lower clickdepth to the
front. Example formulars are:\
recip(ms(NOW,last\_modified),3.16e-11,1,1)\
to sort by last\_modified and bring the most current documents to the
top,\
div(add(references\_internal\_i,product(references\_external\_i,references\_exthosts\_i)),add(clickdepth\_i,1))\
to consider documents with many external references as more important
but also count the clickdepth. Just try to do your own experiments using
the attributes from the index schema.\
