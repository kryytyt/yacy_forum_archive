SF</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Uber launched a fleet of its much anticipated self-driving cars in San
Francisco on Wednesday, and by late morning the effort already hit a
bad-driver milestone: running a red light. [...]</p>

<p>Annie Gaus, a freelance writer and producer in San Francisco, tweeted
Wednesday morning that she \&ldquo;Just passed a \&lsquo;self-driving\&rsquo; Uber that
lurched into the intersection on Van Ness [Avenue], on a red, nearly
hitting my Lyft.\&rdquo; [...] \&ldquo;It was close enough that both myself and
the driver reacted and were like, \&lsquo;Shit,\&rsquo;\&rdquo; she said. \&ldquo;It stopped
suddenly and stayed like that, as you see in the photo.\&rdquo;</p>

streets</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>With Uber\&rsquo;s self-driving cars now on the streets of San Francisco,
the enforcement of traffic violations is in the hands of The City\&rsquo;s
Police Traffic Company, which was unaware Wednesday morning that the
vehicles began roaming city streets that day. [...]</p>

<p>\&ldquo;I was unaware the cars have been released in the wild,\&rdquo; said San
Francisco Police Traffic Company Sgt. Will Murray. \&ldquo;Isn\&rsquo;t that like
the headless horsemen?\&rdquo;</p>

<p>\&ldquo;They are required to have someone seated in the front driver\&rsquo;s
portion of the vehicle,\&rdquo; said Murray, who added that, \&ldquo;If they were
committing flagrant violations, if they were not obeying the laws\&rdquo;
then traffic officers will pull them over and ticket them.</p>

<p>He did not say if that had yet occurred or how one goes about
ticketing a car driven by a computer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/report-uber-ordered-halt-self-driving-cars-sf-streets/">Uber ordered to halt self-driving cars on SF
streets</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Uber\&rsquo;s action is illegal, California DMV Deputy Director Brian G.
Soublet wrote in a letter to Uber late Wednesday, which was also sent
to press. Soublet added that the ride-hail behemoth was required to
obtain an autonomous vehicle testing permit before operating
self-driving vehicles on city streets.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;If Uber does not confirm immediately that it will stop its launch
and seek a testing permit, DMV will initiate legal action,\&rdquo; the DMV
wrote, \&ldquo;including, but not limited to, seeking injunctive relief.\&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://sfist.com/2016/12/15/uber_blames_humans_as_more_reports.php">Uber Blames Its Drivers As More Reports Of Self-Driving Cars Running
Red Lights
Surface</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suggesting that this was more than first day jitters, KRON 4 got its
hands on a set of photos that the channel says show an autonomous Uber
driving through a red light on Harrison at 4th Street. The pictures
were taken on Sunday morning, which means that the car was likely
being used for testing or mapping purposes and did not carry a paying
passenger. Still, it would suggest that the software piloting the
autonomous vehicles had problems as recently as three days before the
much publicized launch of the autonomous ride-hail service. That is,
unless these incidents are all the result of human error -- a.k.a.
Uber drivers.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;These incidents were due to human error,\&rdquo; an Uber spokesperson told
the Guardian about the both the Van Ness incident and the 3rd Street
incident. \&ldquo;This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer
by building self-driving Ubers. The drivers involved have been
suspended while we continue to investigate.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>Isn\&rsquo;t that neat? It\&rsquo;s the humans, not the un-permitted software,
that is at fault according to Uber. Unfortunately, that argument
likely won\&rsquo;t sway the DMV.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let\&rsquo;s see...</p>

<p>The self-driving software is bad enough that they run red lights and
make dangerous turns... but they have humans in the drivers\&rsquo; seat! Who
are also so terrible at their jobs that they can\&rsquo;t prevent the car from
running red lights and must be fired.</p>

<p>I guess none of us are as incompetent as all of us? The software is so
bad that it makes human drivers <em>even worse?</em></p>

<p>The usual argument for self-driving cars is that they will be safer for
everyone than human-piloted cars. If that hypothesis turns out to be
true, then I\&rsquo;m all for them! One can even imagine a shiny Starfleet
future where self-driving cars lead to the end of personal car ownership
and dramatic emissions reduction. Enter the shimmering arc!</p>

<p>Uber, of course, does not give the slightest fractional shits about
whether self-driving cars are <em>safer</em> or <em>cleaner</em>: they are interested
in them because they are <em>cheaper.</em> Allow me to remind you of this bit
from <a href="http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Fight-Club.html"><em>Fight Club:</em></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I\&rsquo;m a recall coordinator. My job is to apply the formula. It\&rsquo;s a
story problem.</p>

<p>A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60 miles
per hour. The rear differential locks up. The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside. Now: do we initiate a recall?</p>

<p>Take the number of vehicles in the field, (A), and multiply it by the
probable rate of failure, (B), then multiply the result by the average
out-of-court settlement, &copy;. A times B times C equals X... If X is
less than the cost of a recall, we don\&rsquo;t do one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now we get to the part where the Uber software, operating as
designed, is now literally trying to murder me:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sfbike.org/news/a-warning-to-people-who-bike-self-driving-ubers-and-right-hook-turns/">SF Bicycle Coalition: A Warning to People Who Bike: Self-Driving Ubers
and Right Hook
Turns</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before the surprise launch of Uber\&rsquo;s autonomous vehicles on San
Francisco streets this week, I rode in one. I can tell you firsthand:
Those vehicles are not yet ready for our streets.</p>

<p>I was at one of the demonstrations covered in the SF Examiner, along
with others who Uber hoped to impress with their new technology. None
of us were told that just two days later, Uber would be releasing this
technology on our streets on a large scale. I did tell Uber some
things about the shortcomings of that technology, however.</p>

<p>In the ride I took through the streets of SoMa on Monday, the
autonomous vehicle in \&ldquo;self-driving\&rdquo; mode as well as the one in
front of it took an unsafe right-hook-style turn through a bike lane.
Twice. This kind of turn is one featured in a <a href="https://www.sfbike.org/news/bike-lanes-and-right-turns/">2013 blog
post</a> that is
known to be one of the primary causes of collisions between cars and
people who bike resulting in serious injury or fatality. It\&rsquo;s also an
unsafe practice that we address in all of the safety curriculum we
offer to professional drivers, including the videos we consulted on
for Uber as recently as this fall.</p>

<p>I told staff from Uber\&rsquo;s policy and engineering teams about the
safety hazards of their autonomous vehicle technology. They told me
they would work on it. Then, two days later, they unleashed that
technology on San Francisco\&rsquo;s streets. Your streets.</p>

<p>Since yesterday, we have been told that \&ldquo;safety drivers\&rdquo; in these
vehicles have been instructed to disengage from self-driving mode when
approaching right turns on a street with a bike lane and that
engineers are continuing to work on the problem. In the meantime, Uber
is continuing to operate autonomous vehicles for passenger service in
San Francisco.</p>

<p>There\&rsquo;s no other way to put it: Launching autonomous vehicle
technology before it\&rsquo;s regulated and safe for our streets is
unacceptable. If you support safe streets, please <a href="http://www.sfbike.org/news/a-warning-to-people-who-bike-self-driving-ubers-and-right-hook-turns/">sign the
petition</a>
to tell Uber to address this dangerous and illegal turning behavior
immediately.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The people who wrote this software <em>do not understand the traffic laws</em>
and programmed it with a set of rules that they figured was <em>close
enough</em>. And then released them into the public.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;Disrupt transportation! Move fast, release early, and crush innocent
people under two tons of fast-moving steel!\&rdquo;</p>

<p>I really can\&rsquo;t express how unsettling it was today, riding my bicycle
in traffic in the rain -- a time when San Francisco drivers are
notoriously even <em>less competent</em> and <em>more erratic</em> than under normal
conditions -- and wondering what fresh new hell of unpredictability I
might encounter from poorly-behaving <em>software</em> in an alpha-test that I
most assuredly <em>did not</em> click \&ldquo;Agree\&rdquo; on.</p>

<p>Fuck Uber.</p>
