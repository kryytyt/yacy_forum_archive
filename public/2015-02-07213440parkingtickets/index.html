<h1 id="parking-tickets-by-the-truckload">Parking tickets by the truckload</h1>

<p>Date: 2015-02-07 21:34:40</p>

<p>Let me get this straight: faced with international corporations who
repeatedly and blatantly violate the law, <em>and</em> have the balls to
publicly state that violating the law is <em>part of their business plan</em>,
the local government\&rsquo;s response is to make it <em>cheaper and easier</em> for
those companies to continue breaking the law?</p>

<p>This article is from 2007, but I assume the situation has only gotten
more ridiculous since then.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Parking-tickets-by-the-truckload-18-S-F-2615428.php"><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/head-asplode.png" alt="" />18 S.F. businesses rack
up thousands of citations, pay city on monthly
plan</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>San Francisco began its corporate program in 1998. The intent was
twofold: help companies doing regular business in San Francisco manage
their tickets, and streamline the collection process, said Maggie
Lynch, spokeswoman for the MTA.</p>

<p>Companies can enroll if they have at least 20 vehicles that park on
city streets and if they have what Lynch described as \&ldquo;a history of
citations.\&rdquo; The participating firms are billed monthly and cannot
protest the tickets. In return, they avoid late fees and having their
vehicles clamped with immobilizing boots when a vehicle accrues five
or more parking tickets.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;Drivers used to hide their citations from management, so companies
would not know of a problem until vehicles were booted or towed,\&rdquo;
Lynch said. [...]</p>

<p>Delivery companies enrolled in the program are the biggest parking
violators, accruing almost \$1.3 million in fines. [...]</p>

<p>\&ldquo;I get tickets all the time, probably three or four a week,\&rdquo; said
Gonzalez, who has 10 years on the job.</p>

<p>Most of his tickets are for double parking. On the Bryant Street run,
a passenger car was parked in front of the building where Gonzalez was
making a delivery. There were a number of empty metered spaces on the
block, but Gonzalez said it would have taken too much time to squeeze
his truck into one of them. [...]</p>

<p>\&ldquo;This is part of the price of doing business,\&rdquo; said Jim McCluskey, a
spokesman for FedEx, which paid San Francisco \$434,046 for 7,711
tickets [in 2006]. \&ldquo;We encourage our operators to park legally, but
we also need to meet the needs of our customers who want reliable,
on-time service.\&rdquo;</p>
