<p>Date: 2015-10-05 02:59:29</p>

<p>If you work for Facebook, quit. It is morally indefensible for you to
use your skills to make that company more powerful. By working there,
you are making the world an objectively worse place. I\&rsquo;m sure you can
find a job working for a company that you don\&rsquo;t have to <em>apologize</em> for
all the time.</p>

<p>You can <em>do it.</em> I <em>believe</em> in you.</p>

Blue: Why I\&rsquo;m sitting at home crying on a
Saturday:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Next, Facebook said that to access my account I had to pass a security
test to prove it was me, on the grounds of protecting my account\&rsquo;s
security. These tests, which I attempted to pass for over an hour,
were based on inaccurate information and literally impossible to pass.
[...] All paths ended with access to my Facebook account being
restored in exchange for me uploading a government ID. Not alternate
forms of ID, but a strict and specific list of government-only
identification. [...]</p>

<p>I had no less than three people approach me in the following days
offering to help me get my account back, special favors style, from
the inside. Two were private offers and one was public, from
Facebook\&rsquo;s own head of security. I wonder how many other journalists
who -- like me -- have covered Facebook critically in the past and
then found themselves in my position, and took the special favor.
Facebook, in fact, holds the particular honor of being one of the
first entities I broke a story about, then secretly contacted my
executive editors with false accusations about my professionalism
while working on the story. [...]</p>

<p>I have since tried to contact Facebook\&rsquo;s Security, Privacy, Info and
Support departments -- without any special favors from Facebook
employees. I have been told (alarmingly, with with increasing
incompetence) that I must upload my ID. Facebook has not demonstrated
that it is responsible enough, trustworthy enough, or even skilled
enough at the basics of user security procedure to be handed a copy of
my ID. [...]</p>

<p>Do I want my account back? Only for one reason now. I\&rsquo;m prepared to
give up the business reasons I kept a Facebook account, though it is
going to make some things very difficult (also not possible) for me as
a journalist and author. I want my info, so I know what risks I can
expect from the shadow profile Facebook keeps on me and can try to
mitigate the risks from rogue employees, powerful authorities, and any
absolute bungling fuckup incompetency from Facebook itself, as I
witnessed going through its \&ldquo;security questions\&ldquo;.</p>

<p>But now I just want out. I want my account deleted. I want the
bullshit, inaccurate pages Facebook creates about me without my
consent gone, too, but that\&rsquo;s just a bitter little joke for the ages,
isn\&rsquo;t it? Facebook is just going to do whatever the fuck it wants to
me. And to you.</p>

<p>Of course, Facebook won\&rsquo;t let me delete my circa-2007 account until I
give up my ID.</p>
