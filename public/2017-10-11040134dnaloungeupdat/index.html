<p>Date: 2017-10-11 04:01:34</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dnalounge.com/webcast/">video webcast</a> is down again.
This time, it is because Youtube has put us on Double Secret Probation
for some unknown reason. (The <a href="https://www.dnalounge.com/webcast/archive/">audio
archives</a> are fine, it\&rsquo;s
the video stream that is down.)</p>
<p>Their belligerent robots have this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proceed with the appeal of the Community Guidelines warning strike for
the following videos</p>
<p>The YouTube team will review our decision and reinstate your video if
appropriate. It is possible that the strike may be removed but your
video will remain down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elsewhere it says, \&ldquo;Live stream restrictions last for 90 days or until
the associated issue(s) are resolved.\&rdquo; But since they won\&rsquo;t actually
come out and tell you what the \&ldquo;issues\&rdquo; are, good luck with that.</p>
<p>Why did it happen? Who knows. All they will tell you is, \&ldquo;It was
probably one of the hundreds of possible vague reasons in this FAQ
entry\&ldquo;. Could it be that some band\&rsquo;s backing video triggered a pattern
match against a video? <em>Maybe?</em> Could it be that some disgruntled
customer \&ldquo;reported\&rdquo; us for something, and all it takes is one griefer
to take your stream offline for three months? <em>Maybe?</em> Who can tell!
Only the robot know and they aren\&rsquo;t talking.</p>
<p>Anyway, it\&rsquo;s fair to assume that we can\&rsquo;t use Youtube any more.</p>
<p>Youtube was always a flaky, halfassed solution anyway: for the last
three years, we\&rsquo;ve been <a href="https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2014/12/05.html">webcasting <em>silent</em>
video</a> through
Youtube while simulcasting the audio from our own server, and having
your web browser press play on both streams at the same time. Which is
awful because it means audio and video can never, ever be in sync. But
if we ever allow Youtube to hear our audio, their robots <a href="https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2014/09/03.html">completely
freak out</a> and
shut us down because they have <em>no mechanism</em> to understand that, as a
nightclub, we are, in fact, fully licensed to play Other People\&rsquo;s
Music.</p>
<p>So. Do you watch our webcast? Would you like to continue doing so? Then
help me figure out how to solve this problem without spending any money.</p>
<p>Here are some possibilities, unlikely though they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Befriend someone inside Youtube who can make this go away. (Right.)</li>
<li>Find me some service who will rebroadcast my video stream for free,
<sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. They need to support video ingestion via RTMP, not a custom
app, or I probably can\&rsquo;t make it work.</li>
<li>Show me instructions for installing free software on a CentOS 6.9
system that will let me run my own RTMP-based video rebroadcaster.
Bonus points if you have <em>actually done this successfully yourself</em>.
Going this route will probably require massively throttling the
number of simultaneous viewers.</li>
<li>You pay for it! Set up an EC2 or DO server running the
aforementioned RTMP server, let me broadcast through, and and let\&rsquo;s
just put the bandwidth bill on your credit card instead of mine, ok?</li>
</ol>
<p>Long shots, I know. But absent something like that, I guess the plug on
the video has finally been pulled.</p>
