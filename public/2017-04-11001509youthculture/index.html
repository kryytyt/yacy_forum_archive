question mark

<blockquote>
<p>\&lsquo;Emo might have been the last subculture,\&rsquo; says Jamie Brett, a
former emo himself who now works for Youth Club Archive, an
organisation that collects images of the numerous youth subcultures
that broke out in the UK between the 1950s and 2010.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think what that actually says is, \&rdquo;<strong>[MEMBER</strong> <strong>OF DEFUNCT
SUBCULTURE]</strong> says <strong>[MY DEFUNCT SUBCULTURE]</strong> was the End of
History.\&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So where have all the tribes gone? While old scenes -- goth, mod,
skinheads -- still survive, there have been no unique youth tribes
since emo and Nu Rave in the mid 2000s. There\&rsquo;s a sense that this
ties in with the rise of the internet, with a more interconnected
society removing that need for intensely localised scenes, which often
coalesced around a single record or clothes shop or a particular club
or band. The wide availability of music allows young people to explore
sounds across genres and timeframes, which could also disrupt that
need for a tribal identity -- and music is central to the tribes
covered by Youth Club.</p>
<p>\&lsquo;There are still elements of copying each other, especially things
like make-up, which is massive with teenagers, but there aren\&rsquo;t those
identifiable tribe aesthetics that you got from face-to-face
contact,\&rsquo; says Brett. \&lsquo;They say club culture has gone underground
again because it is so expensive for young people to go out and so
many clubs are being closed, so house parties are what\&rsquo;s happening.
Maybe now they are taking things into their own hands something will
emerge. We are also experiencing a demand for the tangible in the form
of vinyl and I wonder if that will create more movements.\&rsquo; Until
then, we are left only with our past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I dunno, that all sounds fairly \&ldquo;old man yells at cloud\&rdquo; and that\&rsquo;s a
lot of assertions without any support, let alone evidence. But maybe it
has \&ldquo;truthiness\&ldquo;.</p>
<p>I am forever reminding people that <a href="https://www.dnalounge.com/">DNA
Lounge</a>\&rsquo;s competition is not the bar down
the street, it\&rsquo;s Netflix.</p>
<p>Also, \&ldquo;Nu Rave\&ldquo;? Come on, that was never actually a thing, any more
than \&ldquo;Seapunk\&rdquo; was. They were punchlines in fashion magazines and
Tumblr posts, not subcultures.</p>
