<p><a href="http://sleepmode.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/inzkyuf.gif" alt="" /></a><a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2010/10/im-on-a-boathhhhhhhhh-in-a-museum/"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/museum.jpg" alt="" /></a><a href="http://sleepmode.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en"><em>Sleep
Mode: The Art of the
Screensaver</em></a> is an
exhibition curated by RafaÃ«l Rozendaal at Rotterdam\&rsquo;s <a href="http://hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en/museum">Het Nieuwe
Instituut</a> from January 27 until
June 25.</p>

<p>I think this is awesome, because screen savers don\&rsquo;t get the respect
that they deserve.</p>

<p>There are some from <a href="https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/">XScreenSaver</a> in
there but I\&rsquo;m not sure exactly which. I\&rsquo;m also really curious what the
physical exhibition space looks like, but there aren\&rsquo;t any photos of it
yet.</p>

<p><a href="http://sleepmode.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en/interview">He says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What fascinates me is that so many people saw screensavers on a daily
basis, without really looking at them carefully. I found it
interesting that the images could lodge themselves subconsciously in
our brains. It was a matter of recognising something you were never
fully conscious of. You never wondered where it came from or who made
it, or what their intention was. That is why I didn\&rsquo;t search for
obscure examples, but stuck to familiar screensavers.</p>

<p>For me the idea of staring is very important. When you are tired and
just gazing blankly at what is in front of you. Most of the things we
do on the computer are done with a purpose in mind, but screensavers
relate to a very different part of your brain. That is why I like the
title Sleep Mode. Most art is best experienced by just looking at it
without thinking too much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He interviewed me and five other screen saver makers about the purpose
and history of screen savers. I am saddened to report that I\&rsquo;m the only
one of them who actually <em>uses</em> a screen saver any more! What a world,
what a world. In the interview one of the questions he asked was, <a href="http://sleepmode.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en/screensaver-makers">\&ldquo;Do
you see a future for
screensavers?\&rdquo;</a>
and I am afraid that I felt obliged to deploy the snark:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any time some pedantic jerk says \&ldquo;YOU KNOW, screen savers aren\&rsquo;t
really NECESSARY with modern monitors\&rdquo; I want to ask them \&ldquo;How awful
is it to have been born without a soul?\&rdquo; Screen savers are art. As
long as computers have screens, people will make art for them. I also
find it amusing when I am in an art museum or gallery and see a
\&ldquo;digital installation\&rdquo; where the only difference between that work
and a \&ldquo;screen saver\&rdquo; is that they wrote an \&ldquo;artist\&rsquo;s statement\&rdquo;
about how it explores the dichotomy between whatever -- and/or
someone gave them a grant for it.\&rdquo;</p>
