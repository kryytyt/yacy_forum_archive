<a href="http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/news-san-francisco-chemtrails-conspiracy-activism-airplanes-weather-climate-geoengineering-protest/Content?oid=3955115&amp;showFullText=true">How is this koo-koo krazypants getting a cover
story?</a></p>
<p>I mean, I love apocalyptic illuminati conspiracy fiction as much as the
next guy -- ok, a lot more than the next guy, because that guy\&rsquo;s a
sheeple -- but come on.</p>
<p>Slow news week? Ran out of Dirt Rave stories already?</p>
<p>We should <em>be so lucky</em> as to have a vast, faceless meta-governmental
conspiracy that was competent enough to pull this off. It would mean
that <em>adults</em> were in charge. Or Gods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A thumbnail sketch of the science behind chemtrails is difficult
because there are competing theories about what that science entails.
But most activists, including Roddie, agree that curbing global
warming seems to be the purpose. In layman\&rsquo;s terms, chemtrails are
believed to be an aerosol that contains aluminum (which deflects
sunlight), as well as a cocktail of other toxic elements such as
barium and strontium. According to Roddie, this aerosol has insidious
side effects, including Alzheimer\&rsquo;s, autism, asthma, respiratory
failure, pulmonary failure, and stroke.</p>
<p>Another major side effect: California\&rsquo;s historic drought. [...]</p>
<p>Hall says she protects herself as best she can, but as a gardener, she
works outside every day and is vulnerable. She no longer drives with
her windows down, she says, and she bought a water filter to sift out
impurities. Occasionally, she detoxes from the heavy metals in her
blood by taking supplements such as chlorella, zeolite powder, and
bentonite clay. She also eats as much cilantro as she can, which
assuages metallic contamination, she claims.</p>
<p>Rumors of sickness and bodily mutation run rampant through the
chemtrails community. Hall mentions a fellow activist who tested her
dog\&rsquo;s blood for heavy metals and discovered thorium, a radioactive
element that has been used as nuclear fuel.</p>
<p>She also mentions Morgellons, a controversial condition -- classified
by most physicians as a delusional parasitosis -- in which people
develop sores they believe to be caused by parasites, insects, or
invasive synthetic fibers. In 2008, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention investigated Morgellons among patients in Northern
California, a hotbed of self-reported Morgellons diagnoses, and
concluded there was \&ldquo;no infectious cause and no evidence of an
environmental link.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hall is unconvinced. \&ldquo;All of us have fibers in us because they spray
them in the sky, and they\&rsquo;re all over the ground, and they\&rsquo;re in the
soil, and they\&rsquo;re in the water,\&rdquo; she says. <strong>\&ldquo;These fibers are
self-replicating nanotechnology. To me, those are the scariest words
I\&rsquo;ve ever heard in my life.\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Marsha Dawson, a North Bay activist who works with Roddie and Hall,
agrees that chemtrails exact a disastrous human toll. She says she
experiences \&ldquo;memory problems\&rdquo; and lung pain because of her exposure.
Dawson drinks Fiji and Volvic water constantly because both contain
silica that, she claims, loosens the aluminum particles in her body.
She also finds relief in black cherry bark syrup from Whole Foods.
[...]</p>
<p>The scope of the program Herndon envisions is mind-boggling. According
to him, the fly ash is transported on railways that connect coal
plants to military and civilian airports across the country. The ash
is loaded onto a fleet of 1,000 or more planes, he estimates, all of
which fly off-the-radar, often at night, without transponders or
flight plans. These ghost planes, Herndon says, have poisoned the
country and induced California\&rsquo;s drought. He alleges that certain
leafy plants in the Golden State now exhibit high concentrations of
thallium -- Saddam Hussein\&rsquo;s favorite poison for political
assassinations. [...]</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Pretty much one hundred percent of people who believe in chemtrails
will believe that <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> was an inside job and the World Trade Center
was pre-rigged with explosives,\&rdquo; West says. (In fact, prior to
becoming a chemtrails activist, Roddie was involved in We Are Change,
a \&ldquo;nonpartisan, independent media organization\&rdquo; that promotes the
idea of a <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> cover-up.) [...]</p>
<p>As West points out, the scope of the program that Herndon suggests
would implicate every meteorologist, airline pilot, and climate
scientist in the world, plus a significant chunk of the Pentagon,
Congress, Cabinet, and White House -- and numerous other governments
and industries worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least chemtrails are vegan. Better drink Pepsi-branded bottled water,
though, just to be safe. STAY VIGILANT.</p>
