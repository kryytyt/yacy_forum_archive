Headcanon:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>That Federation vessels in Star Trek seem to experience bizarre
malfunctions with such overwhelming frequency isn\&rsquo;t just an artefact
of the television serial format. Rather, it\&rsquo;s because the Federation
as a culture are a bunch of deranged hyper-neophiles, tooling around
in ships packed full of beyond-cutting-edge tech they don\&rsquo;t really
understand. Endlessly frustrating if you have to fight them, because
they can pull an effectively unlimited number of bullshit space-magic
countermeasures out of their arses - but they\&rsquo;re as likely as not to
give themselves a lethal five-dimensional wedgie in the process. All
those rampant holograms and warp core malfunctions and
accidentally-traveling-back-in-time incidents? That doesn\&rsquo;t actually
happen to anyone else; it\&rsquo;s literally just Federation vessels that go
off the rails like that. And they do so on a fairly regular basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Getting a link to a whole thread on Tumblr seems to be an impossibility,
but
<a href="http://beka-tiddalik.tumblr.com/post/150425828285/roachpatrol-deadcatwithaflamethrower">these</a>
are some amusing replies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So to everyone else in the galaxy, all humans are basically Doc Brown.</p>

<p>Aliens who have seen the Back to the Future movies literally don\&rsquo;t
realise that Doc Brown is meant to be funny. They\&rsquo;re just like \&ldquo;yes,
that is exactly what all human scientists are like in my experience\&ldquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vulcan Science Academy: Why do you need another warp core</p>

<p>Humans: We\&rsquo;re going to plug two of them together and see if we go
twice as fast</p>

<p>VSA: Last time we gave you a warp core you threw it into a sun to see
if the sun would go twice as fast</p>

<p>Humans: Hahaha yeah</p>

<p>Humans: It did tho</p>

<p>VSA: IT EXPLODED</p>

<p>Humans: It exploded twice as fast</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Klingons: Okay we don\&rsquo;t get it</p>

<p>Vulcan Science Academy: Get what</p>

<p>Klingons: You Vulcans are a bunch of stuffy prisses but you\&rsquo;re also
tougher, stronger, and smarter than Humans in every single way</p>

<p>Klingons: <em>Why do you let them run your Federation</em></p>

<p>Vulcan Science Academy: Look</p>

<p>Vulcan Science Academy: This is a species where if you give them two
warp cores they don\&rsquo;t do experiments on one and save the other for if
the first one blows up</p>

<p>Vulcan Science Academy: This is a species where if you give them two
warp cores, they will ask for a third one, immediately plug all three
into each other, punch a hole into an alternate universe where humans
subscribe to an even more destructive ideological system, fight
everyone in it because they\&rsquo;re offended by that, steal <em>their</em> warp
cores, plug <em>those</em> together, punch their way back here, then try to
turn a nearby sun into a torus because that was what their initial
scientific experiment was for and they didn\&rsquo;t want to waste a trip.</p>

<p>Vulcan Science Academy: They did that last week. We have the write-up
right here. it\&rsquo;s getting published in about six hundred scientific
journals across two hundred different disciplines because of how many
established theories their ridiculous little expedition has just
called into question. Also, they <em>did</em> turn that sun into a torus, and
no one actually knows how.</p>

<p>Vulcan Science Academy: <em>This is why we let them do whatever the hell
they want.</em></p>

<p>Klingons: .&hellip; Can we be a part of your Federation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let\&rsquo;s talk about the <em>USS Fucking Pegasus,</em> testbed for the first
Starfleet cloaking device. Here we have a handful of humans working in
secret to develop a cloaking device in violation of a treaty with the
Romulans. They\&rsquo;re playing catchup trying to develop a technology
other species have had for a century. And what do they do? Do they
decide to duplicate a Romulan cloaking device precisely, just see if
they can match what other species have? Nope. They decide, hey, while
we\&rsquo;re at it, while we\&rsquo;re building our <em>very first one of these
things,</em> just to find out if this is possible, <em>let\&rsquo;s see if we can
make this thing phase us out of normal space so we can fly through
planets while we\&rsquo;re invisible.</em></p>

<p>\&ldquo;But why\&rdquo; said the one Vulcan in the room.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;Because that would <em>fucking rule</em>\&rdquo; said the Humans, high-fiving
each other and slamming cans of 24th-century Red Bull.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humans get mildly offended by the way they are presented in non-human
media.</p>

<p>Like: \&ldquo;Guys, we totally wouldn\&rsquo;t do that!\&rdquo; But this always fails to
get much traction, because the authors can always say: \&ldquo;You totally
did.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>\&ldquo;That was ONE TIME.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>There\&rsquo;s that movie where humans invented vaccines by just testing
them on people. Or the one about those two humans who invented powered
flight by crashing a bunch of prototypes. Or the one about
electricity.</p>

<p>And human historians go, \&ldquo;Oh, uh, this is historically accurate, but
also kind of boring.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.metafilter.com/162913/MacGyver-is-the-equivalent-of-Vulcan-vintage-human-horror-television#6763353">But when the Vulcans made first
contact</a>
with Earth - \&ldquo;what the hell is that insane thing these aliens here
have built, let\&rsquo;s go look at it\&rdquo; - humans didn\&rsquo;t look at them as an
enemy or a resource or even an asset. No, the very first time humans
met Vulcans, they tried to do the Vulcan hand thingy and they
couldn\&rsquo;t do it so they just offered a handshake, and then said
\&ldquo;let\&rsquo;s get drunk and party.\&rdquo; THIS IS ACTUAL LITERAL CANON,
REMEMBER.</p>

<p>Further in this vein:</p>

<p>I will never be over the fact that during first contact a human
offered their hand to a vulcan and the vulcan was just like \&ldquo;wow
humans are fucking wild\&rdquo; and took it</p>

<p>Note: Vulcan hand / finger touching is a sex thing.</p>

<p><a href="https://roachpatrol.tumblr.com/post/139802211452/my-headcanon-for-startrek-is-that-humans-look-to">My headcanon for
startrek</a>
is that humans look, to vulcans, like a dog frathouse. Like signing on
to a human ship is exactly that thrillingly loud and frustrating and
fast and stupid and fun. The humans are going to dash off to a new
sector to see if there are friends there and then they will jump up
and down with delight and stuff their faces up against their new
friends\&rsquo; genital array. The humans are going to bark for ten minutes
at a rock. The humans want to chase things they can\&rsquo;t possibly catch
just because they like running around. The humans are madly passionate
about their arbitrary group identities. The humans can be divided into
new arbitrary group identities which they will then be passionate
about. The humans want to stick their heads out of the window of their
starship and go \&lsquo;wheee!\&lsquo;. If you step on a human\&rsquo;s paw they will
act like you just killed them for about thirty seconds and then want
more headpats. The humans can be immediately distracted from crucial
duties by the appearance of a small animal. If you howl all the humans
in earshot will howl louder just to show off. A human just humped your
leg. \&lsquo;Don\&rsquo;t make it weird bro\&rsquo; the human says. Later the human will
dig a weird bug out of the ground and eat it.</p>
