<p>Hello paleolas,<br />
from the moment a web resource is indexed in at least one YaCy peer
reachable from other peers in the \&lsquo;freeworld\&rsquo; network, one can
consider that this resource has entered the YaCy peer-to-peer network.<br />
But from that moment, if you pick a random YaCy peer and search for a
term present in that web resource, this one will not necessarily appears
immediately in the results, as the corresponding index entry has not yet
been propagated to other peers.<br />
<br />
As I see it, there are some key steps for a web resource initially
unkown to the YaCy p2p network to then appear in most peers search
results.<br />
<br />
[First indexing. ]{style=&ldquo;font-weight: bold&rdquo;}<br />
Here are some possible example scenarios :<br />
- someone running a YaCy node explicitely crawls that unkown web
resource. This can eventually be the owner of the resource that would
like it appears in the YaCy network.<br />
- during a crawl on a YaCy node, a resource linking to the unkown web
resource is encountered, and the crawl profile permits following that
link and continue crawling on it<br />
- someone using the YaCy proxy navigation feature encounter a resource
linking to the unknown resource and follows the link<br />
- the unknown resource is indexed by a website or search engine
supporting the OpenSearch specification, that last one is configured as
an alternative source by a YaCy peer (in its Heuristics configuration),
and someone searches on that YaCy peer for term(s) present in the
unknown web resource.<br />
<br />
For all these examples, the prerequisite is that the initially unkown
web resource is not blocked by each considered YaCy peer blacklist.<br />
One can also easily see that except when a YaCy peer owner already knows
the new resource, the more resources links to it, the more there are
chances for a new resource to be introduced in the YaCy p2p network.<br />
<br />
[Propagation. ]{style=&ldquo;font-weight: bold&rdquo;}<br />
Again, some possible scenarios :<br />
- the new index entry is distributed when the first YaCy peer which
holds it applies the scheduled background distribution algorithm and
eventually transfers it to another peer<br />
- someone searches on a YaCy peer for term(s) present in the new index
entry, the peer that holds it is selected by the remote peers selection
algorithm, and the new entry is duplicated on the searching peer local
data. The peers selection algorithm does not necessarily selects all
peers holding index entries matching the searched term(s), but likely
only a subset of them. So even if the new entry contains popular terms,
it will not be immediately distributed this way.<br />
<br />
Again, during propagation, each peer custom blacklist rules apply. So in
a situation where every YaCy peers blacklist blocked the new entry, it
would never be propagated.<br />
We also see here that there are more chances for the new entry to be
propagated if the first peer that holds it runs continuously 24 hours a
day.<br />
<br />
[Ranking.]{style=&ldquo;font-weight: bold&rdquo;}<br />
Ok, so now multiple YaCy peers have a copy of the new entry in their own
local index or in their own part of the globally distributed index. If
you search for term(s) present in the new resource on each of them, the
resource entry will probably be each time in a different position in the
search results, because :<br />
- each peer can define its own custom ranking rules<br />
- each peer has a different local index and local parts of the globally
distributed index<br />
<br />
[Maintaining in indexes.]{style=&ldquo;font-weight: bold&rdquo;}<br />
Of course each YaCy peer has only a limited amount of dedicated disk
space available. To prevent unlimited index growing size, some may be
configured to regularly delete the oldest entries. In the end, if no
peer at all recrawl our newly indexed entry, it may eventually
completely disappear from the network.<br />
So to maintain its presence in the YaCy p2p network, a given resource
must be regularly recrawled, by at least one peer, explicitely or
indirectly, with the same possible scenarios as described in the \&lsquo;First
indexing\&rsquo; step.<br />
Again, the various custom blacklists are to consider, and the more
resources links to the resource, the more there are chances for it to be
regularly recrawled and thus maintained in the YaCy p2p network.<br />
<br />
I hope I didn\&rsquo;t forget too many important points, and it will help
having a more clear view of the global process.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day</p>
