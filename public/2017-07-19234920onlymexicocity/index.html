<blockquote>
<p>So before nuclear war ends all life on Earth, for shits \&lsquo;n giggles,
why not have this artwork displayed on billboards right where much of
this world altering nuttiness occurs, Washington DC? The people must
be alerted, and they won\&rsquo;t even need the glasses!</p>

<p>It turned out to be a little more difficult than I imagined.. The
first billboard company, \&lsquo;Clear Channel\&lsquo;, was good to go. I had it
all planned out with them before I started the crowd funding. They had
seen the \&ldquo;Make America Great Again/They Live\&rsquo; art and didn\&rsquo;t voice
any objections. When I was ready to give them the money to actually
install the Washington billboard they got cold feet and changed their
minds.</p>

<p>\&lsquo;Outfront Media\&rsquo; was the next company that respond to my inquiries.
Again, I showed them the art first. They explained the no way in hell
was this going to fly in Washington, so I went with a Chicago
billboard that was around 25 by 30\&rsquo; for \$2800. I redesigned the art
to fit but just as I finished they also emailed with second thoughts
and backed out.</p>

<p>I went to \&lsquo;Interstate Outdoor Advertising\&rsquo; and sent them the art.
Again, no problem. What I could get for our \$3000 was a 14 by 48\&rsquo;
billboard outside of Chicago on I-55. I again redrew the art to fit,
signed the contracts and sent them my payment information. Then they
came to their senses and said no-go.</p>

<p>I went back to \&lsquo;JCDecaux\&rsquo; a company I had sounded out earlier that
only offered those 5\&rsquo; high panels on the side of bus stops in
Chicago. At this point, I\&rsquo;m open to most anything. For \$3000 I could
have one on Michigan Ave for a month, but a day later this was waiting
in my inbox \&ldquo;I\&rsquo;m afraid that since this is political in nature,
especially with the bad press Kathy Griffin gave recently, the City
will turn down your ad copy\&rdquo; was their thanks but no thanks response.</p>

<p>In all I think I contacted over thirty billboard companies, some that
had thousands of ones for rent, and many that had only a few regional
offerings. Most didn\&rsquo;t even respond to multiple inquiries. The ones
that did, started to realize that this is a President that, in all
likelihood, will make it a personal vendetta to destroy whatever
company dares mock him. Others were more upfront with their reasoning,
\&ldquo;Thanks for your e-mail. I will discuss your artwork and idea with
the owner of our company on Monday. However, I need to let you know
that we are all huge Trump supporters and we would not post anything
on our billboards that would appear to disparage the President in any
way. Love Donald Trump!!!!\&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, I don\&rsquo;t think much of Donald Trump, but I soft-selled this as
much as humanly possible when making the pitch to anyone I could find,
but it was a no-go TO EVERY SINGLE BILLBOARD COMPANY IN THE UNITED
STATES! I thought that was the end of it. But then, cue music, the
brave folks across the border, the upstanding heroic citizens of
Mexico that Trump based his campaign on objectifying as rapists and
criminals, had the cojones to give Trump the FU.</p>

<p>God Bless Mexico, the only country left that has the freedom to
display the The Trump / They Live Billboard!</p>
