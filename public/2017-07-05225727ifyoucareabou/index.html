<p>Date: 2017-07-05 22:57:27</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-campus/"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/winters_wired_aerial_6526.jpg" alt="" />The new
headquarters Apple is building in Cupertino has the absolute best door
handles. The greatest!</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple\&rsquo;s new HQ is a retrograde, literally inward-looking building
with contempt for the city where it lives and cities in general.
[...] By building a mega-headquarters straight out of the middle of
the last century, Apple has exacerbated the already serious problems
endemic to 21st-century suburbs like Cupertino -- transportation,
housing, and economics. Apple Park is an anachronism wrapped in glass,
tucked into a neighborhood. [...]</p>

<p>Ten percent of people working in Cupertino means that 90 percent of
the people in the Spaceship will commute. Most of them live in San
Jose (10 miles east) and San Francisco (45 miles north). The lack of a
cohesive regional transportation network in the Bay Area privileges
cars, which is why Google and other tech companies started fielding
their own buses in the last few years. [...]</p>

<p>Still, though...Apple has \$250 billion in cash. Against that, these
community benefits feel small. The company could have chipped in to
double the frequency of CalTrain\&rsquo;s commuter rail. It could have built
a transit center in Cupertino, which, unlike Mountain View and Palo
Alto, has none. \&ldquo;Apple could have done anything. Money was no
object,\&rdquo; says Allison Arieff, editorial director for the San
Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association and lead
author of its recent report on corporate campuses. \&ldquo;They want to be
innovative in everything, and they\&rsquo;re not innovative in this thing.\&rdquo;
Apple is instead making significant improvements to roads and
highways. \&ldquo;If the intractable problems of the region are housing and
congestion, they\&rsquo;re giving the finger to all that,\&rdquo; Arieff says.
[...]</p>

<p>So what could Apple have built? Something taller, with mixed-use
development around it? Cupertino would never have allowed it. But
putting form factor aside, the best, smartest designers and architects
in the world could have tried something new. Instead it produced a
building roughly the shape of a navel, and then gazed into it.</p>
