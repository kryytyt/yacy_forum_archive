A Paper On Nuclear Physics Accepted At A Scientific
Conference</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Automatically generating scientific articles has become easy with
dedicated software such as SCIgen. Even a paper that only repeated the
sentence <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/25/journal-accepts-paper-requesting-removal-from-mailing-list">\&ldquo;Get me of your fucking mailing
list\&rdquo;</a>
was recently accepted for publication. Today I received an invitation
from the <a href="http://atomic-nuclearphysics.conferenceseries.com/">International Conference on Atomic and Nuclear
Physics</a> to submit
a paper. Since I have practically no knowledge of Nuclear Physics I
resorted to iOS auto-complete function to help me writing the paper. I
started a sentence with \&ldquo;Atomic\&rdquo; or \&ldquo;Nuclear\&rdquo; and then randomly
hit the auto-complete suggestions. The text really does not make any
sense. After adding the first illustration on nuclear physics from
Wikipedia, some references and creating a fake identity (Iris Pear,
aka Siri Apple) I submitted the
<a href="http://www.bartneck.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/atomicphysics-2016-6992-abstract-template-iris-pear.pdf">paper</a>
which was
<a href="http://www.bartneck.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/acceptance-notification.pdf">accepted</a>
only three hours later! I know that iOS is a pretty good software, but
reaching tenure has never been this close.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Atomic Physics and I shall not have the same problem with a separate
section for a very long long way. Nuclear weapons will not have to
come out the same day after a long time of the year he added the two
sides will have the two leaders to take the same way to bring up to
their long ways of the same as they will have been a good place for
a good time at home the united front and she is a great place for a
good time. The atoms of a better universe will have the right for
the same as you are the way we shall have to be a great place for a
great time to enjoy the day you are a wonderful person to your great
time to take the fun and take a great time and enjoy the great day
you will be a wonderful time for your parents and kids. Molecular
diagnostics will have been available for the rest by a single day
and a good day to the rest have a wonderful time and aggravation for
the rest day at home time for the two of us will have a great place
for the rest to be great for you tomorrow and tomorrow after all and
I am a very happy boy to the great day and I hope he is wonderful.
Nevertheless I have to go back home to nuclear power to the united
way she is to be the first woman united to work on their own and the
rest will be the same way as she will have to come back to work and
we are still not the way we shall have the united side and we are
not the same way she is the way she said the same as she was a good
time. Physics are great but the way it does it makes you want a good
book and I will pick it to the same time I am just a little more
than I can play for later and then it is very very good for a good
game. Nuclear energy is not a nuclear nuclear power to the nuclear
nuclear program he added and the nuclear nuclear program is a good
united state of the nuclear nuclear power program and the united way
nuclear nuclear program nuclear. Scientist and I have been very good
to me today I hope I have to work on tomorrow after work today so
far but I\&rsquo;m still going for tomorrow night at work today but I\&rsquo;m
not going home said I am a good friend and a great time for the rest
I have been doing. Physics are great but the same as you have been
able and the same way to get the rest to your parents. Atoms for a
play of the same as you can do with a great time to take the rest to
your parents or you will be nucleus a great time for a great place.
Power is not a great place for a good time.</p>
