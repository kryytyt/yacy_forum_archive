Or, \&ldquo;Old Man Yells at Cloud Hosting\&ldquo;.</p>
<p>Currently I host all of my various web sites and services (business and
personal) on a single physical Linux box leased from a small ISP.
That\&rsquo;s been working out fine for me for many years. However, of late my
ISP has become so non-responsive to support requests that I can\&rsquo;t
interpret that any way other than, \&ldquo;We are no longer interested in
being an ISP\&ldquo;.</p>
<p>So, sadly, I think I need to find new hosting.</p>
<p>My initial instinct, because I am an unfrozen caveman, and your modern
ways frighten and confuse me, is to find someone else to rent me a 1U
server. But those appear to be nearly nonexistent these days, because in
this modern world, That Is Simply Not Done.</p>
<p>(And though there are a few companies that do this, the fact that there
are so few makes me suspect that they won\&rsquo;t be in business at all a
couple years from now.)</p>
<p>So I\&rsquo;m looking at virtualization options from Amazon and Digital Ocean
and whatnot, and it\&rsquo;s all very confusing. In particular, figuring out
how much my performance, storage and bandwidth requirements are
<em>actually going to cost</em> is absurdly complicated.</p>
<p>Here\&rsquo;s what I have now, that I need to replace with
equivalent-or-better:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 core 2GHz (faster would be nice)</li>
<li>32 GB RAM</li>
<li>2 TB disk</li>
<li>a backup of that disk</li>
<li>Outbound bandwidth: 2 TBytes / month</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now I\&rsquo;m paying \$300 / month for that.</p>
<p>So it looks to me like Digital Ocean and Amazon are the closest
replacements for that, but it\&rsquo;s hard to tell. I <em>think</em> that the
closest options are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/">Digital Ocean</a>: Their \$240
option (32 GB RAM, 4 core, 90 GB storage, 7TB transfer) looks close,
but that\&rsquo;s not nearly enough storage, and they charge \$100/TB, so
that brings it to \$440/month. Also they don\&rsquo;t specify how fast
those cores are.</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/pricing/">Amazon</a>:
The m4.2large option (32 GB RAM, 8 core, no storage) looks close, at
\$258 (paid a year in advance); plus 2TB storage at \$200/month. So
that puts us at \$458/month already. They also don\&rsquo;t specify core
speed, and that\&rsquo;s for 1Gbps, and if I\&rsquo;m doing my math right,
2TB/month is 6.1Mbps, and I can\&rsquo;t even tell what they charge for
that.</li>
</ul>
<p>It blows my mind how much they want to charge for disk. I can buy a
physical 2TB drive that will last 5+ years for \$80, but these jokers
want me to pay \$200/month for that. That is a markup of 150x! What the
hell!</p>
<p>Options I am not interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to get 2TB of bandwidth into the DNA Lounge building and manage
my own high availability data center, for a single server.</li>
<li>Rewrite 20+ years of code that is in a variety of languages into
whatever toy-du-jour Google insists things be written in to take
advantage of their hosting option.</li>
<li>\&ldquo;Virtual hosts are great because when you realize you need more,
you can instantly upgrade them and start paying more!\&rdquo; I know this
excites many of you, so much, but this feature is completely
uninteresting to me because my requirements are static and because I
prefer to know what I\&rsquo;m paying ahead of time.</li>
<li>Also, just to head this off too: I realize that many people are of
the opinion, \&ldquo;You should run each web site, and each service, on
its own virtual server\&ldquo;, and while that sounds sensible to me in
principle, it sounds less good when each of those virtual servers is
an additional \$250/month. At that price, I\&rsquo;ll run all of my sites
out of the same Apache instance, thanks.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what should I do?</p>
