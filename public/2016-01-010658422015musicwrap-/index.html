<p>Date: 2016-01-01 06:58:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dnalounge.com/webcast/mixtapes/"><img src="https://www.dnalounge.com/webcast/vhs.gif" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>In only approximate order of favoriteness -- and for the <em>thirteenth</em>
year in a row -- here is my year-end wrap-up. As usual, a few of the
entries on the following list were released earlier than 2015, but that
is when I discovered them, so I\&rsquo;m allowing some slack. Though most were
actually released in 2015.</p>
<p>This year I acquired around 80% as much new music as <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/12/2014-music-wrap-up-and-mixtape-147/">last
year</a>:
roughly 60 new releases, almost all released within the last 3 years,
more than half released in 2015. That\&rsquo;s down 50% from
<a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/12/2013-music-wrap-up-and-mixtape-136/">2013</a>.</p>
<p>Number of those bands that I saw perform this year: 15.<br />
Number of those bands that performed at DNA Lounge this year: 5.<br />
Go Team. Both of those numbers are down too.</p>
<p>So I am officially in a rut.</p>
<p>I haven\&rsquo;t commented on all of these because I still find it <em>really
hard</em>. Don\&rsquo;t hold it against them. Listen to the mixtape!</p>
<p>I like these things. You should like them too. Here\&rsquo;s your shopping
list:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.verucasalt.com/">Veruca Salt</a> - \&ldquo;Ghost Notes\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>This album sounds like they could have made it in 1998 -- which is
totally fine by me. It\&rsquo;s really, really great: <em>Triage</em> and <em>The
Museum of Broken Relationships</em> are as good as anything they\&rsquo;ve
ever done. In case you haven\&rsquo;t heard, this is the band\&rsquo;s original
lineup, producer and all. They broke up in 1998, and Louise released
two and a half albums on her own, but now everybody\&rsquo;s happy so they
can get back to writing angry songs about miserable relationships!</p>
<p>I think it\&rsquo;s kind of weird that most of the reviews I\&rsquo;ve read of
it have pretty much pretended that Louise\&rsquo;s \&ldquo;solo\&rdquo; Veruca Salt
albums don\&rsquo;t even exist. I think <em>Resolver</em> is very nearly as good
an album as <em>Eight Arms To Hold You</em> was -- I love every track. And
the later releases were also pretty good: maybe not up to that
standard as whole albums, but they contained some great stuff:
<em>Damage Done</em>, <em>Officially Dead</em>, <em>Closer</em>, <em>Save You</em>...</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.megmyers.com/">Meg Myers</a> - \&ldquo;Sorry\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>More angry songs about terrible relationships! Yay!</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.chvrch.es/">Chvrches</a> - \&ldquo;Every Open Eye\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>I\&rsquo;d say that overall the tracks on this album are consistently
better than on <em>The Bones of What You Believe</em>, but that one had
some better stand-out tracks. By the way, if you haven\&rsquo;t heard
their covers of <em>I Would Die 4 V</em> and <em>Bela Lugosi\&rsquo;s Dead</em>, you
really should.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.youwillloveeachother.com/">Health</a> - \&ldquo;Death Magic\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>This album has a very unusual style: the music is <em>heavy as fuck</em>,
sometimes sounding a bit metal, sometimes a bit industrial, but just
<em>so heavy</em>, and then the vocals come in and he\&rsquo;s singing in this
airy synthpoppy style. It sounds like that would be a complete mess,
but it\&rsquo;s not! Also this was probably the second best show I saw all
year -- and they only came in second to Lydia Lunch, and she\&rsquo;s
hard to top.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.ilovemetric.com/">Metric</a> - \&ldquo;Pagans in Vegas\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>This is a really good album, but I keep wanting them to release
<em>Fantasies</em> again... and it\&rsquo;s not quite <em>Fantasies</em>. But, I felt
the same way about <em>Synthetica</em> too, and that grew on me eventually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.vanbotmusic.com/">Vanbot</a> - \&ldquo;Perfect Storm\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>This album makes me feel sad, and cold, and sad. Ok, I\&rsquo;m really
cold right now. But that\&rsquo;s not why.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/">The Chemical Brothers</a> -
\&ldquo;Born in The Echoes\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Better than <em>Further</em>, definitely, but they are kind of repeating
themselves. <em>Go</em> is probably the best track, and its awesome, but
it\&rsquo;s basically the same as <em>Galvanize</em> (which to me I will always
hear as the <em>Galvanize the Empire</em> mash-up, dammit). <em>Taste of
Honey</em> could be a Recoil song.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.shriekback.com/">Shriekback</a> - \&ldquo;Without Real String
or Fish\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>The first Shriekback album in five years! Three quarters of the
original lineup. It\&rsquo;s definitely a return to their 80s form, much
more in the <em>Oil and Gold</em> vein than <em>Sacred City</em> or <em>Naked Apes</em>.
Of the recent albums, I would still rate <em>Glory Bumps</em> slightly
above this, but it\&rsquo;s very good. I got the <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/03/without-real-string-or-fish/">special edition that
came with a 3d-printed fish and little bits of
string.</a>
Their merch game is very strong.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.happyfangsmusic.com/">Happy Fangs</a> - \&ldquo;Capricorn\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><em>\&ldquo;Excuse me Sir, do you have a minute to talk about rock and
roll?\&rdquo;</em> They are awesome, and I\&rsquo;m glad we have booked them as
often as we have. Though it has been a while.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.fightlikeapesmusic.com/">Fight Like Apes</a> - \&ldquo;Fight
Like Apes\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Even though it\&rsquo;s self-titled, it\&rsquo;s their third or fourth album,
depending on how you count. It\&rsquo;s great, though not as funny as
previous releases. But it\&rsquo;s hard to top song titles like
<em>Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues</em>, <em>Come On Let\&rsquo;s Talk About Our
Feelings</em>, <em>Pull Off Your Arms and Let\&rsquo;s Play In Your Blood</em> (from
<em>\&ldquo;The Body of Christ and the Legs of Tina Turner\&rdquo;</em>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.fiveknivesmusic.com/">Five Knives</a> - \&ldquo;Savages\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Like I said when reviewing their first album, this band is what
Shiny Toy Guns should have been but weren\&rsquo;t. Their lyrics are like,
the <em>brattiest</em> stuff I\&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://wolfalice.co.uk/">Wolf Alice</a> - \&ldquo;My Love Is Cool\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>A little shoegazey, a little grungey. Bellly meets L7?</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.publicservicebroadcasting.net/">Public Service
Broadcasting</a> - \&ldquo;The
Race For Space\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>All of their albums are built around newsreels and old radio
broadcasts. This one is about the space race, obviously. The songs
are not as gimicky as that sounds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.meetmeinorbit.com/">Meet Me In Orbit</a> -
\&ldquo;Traveller\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Synthy, mostly instrumental, and possibly from the
<a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2012/10/19a0/">19A0s</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.jesikavonrabbit.com/">Jesika von Rabbit</a> - \&ldquo;Journey
Mitchell\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>A more electronic album by the singer of Gram Rabbit, a longtime
favorite. It\&rsquo;s goofy. She\&rsquo;s a wonderful goofball.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.speedyortiz.com/">Speedy Ortiz</a> - \&ldquo;Foil Deer\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>This sounds so much like if Liz Phair made records that I actually
like! Wait, that didn\&rsquo;t come out quite right. No, actually, it did.
The Phair is strong in this one, but better. <em>\&ldquo;Sorry I made out
with your friends. I\&rsquo;m not that sorry, I\&rsquo;m never that sorry.\&rdquo;</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.shriekback.com/">Barry Andrews</a> - \&ldquo;Haunted Box of
Switches, Vol. 2\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>The singer of Shriekback does his \&ldquo;crooning with a piano\&rdquo; bit.
Volume 1 was superior, but this makes a good counterpoint to that
copy of <em>\&ldquo;Without Real String or Fish\&rdquo;</em> you were gonna pick up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.sayhitoyourmom.com/">Say Hi</a> - \&ldquo;Bleeder\&rsquo;s Digest\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>More sad songs about vampires! That\&rsquo;s right, it\&rsquo;s the sequel to
<em>Impeccable Blahs</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.sleepthieves.net/">Sleep Thieves</a> - \&ldquo;You Want The
Night\&rdquo;</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.priestofficial.com/">Priest</a> - \&ldquo;Priest\&rdquo;</strong></p></li>
