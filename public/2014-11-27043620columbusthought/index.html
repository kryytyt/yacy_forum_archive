<p><a href="http://archive.org/stream/selectlettersofc00colu/selectlettersofc00colu_djvu.txt"><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/fig089.jpg" alt="" />And the Garden of Eden was at
the top of the
nipple.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have always read, that the world comprising the land and the water
was spherical, and the recorded experiences of Ptolemy and all others,
have proved this by the eclipses of the moon, and other observations
made from east to west, as well as by the elevation of the pole from
north to south. But as I have already described, I have now seen so
much irregularity, that I have come to another conclusion respecting
the earth, namely, that it is not round as they describe, but of the
form of a pear, which is very round except where the stalk grows, at
which part it is most prominent; or like a round ball, upon one part
of which is a prominence like a woman\&rsquo;s nipple, this protrusion being
the highest and nearest the sky, situated under the equinoctial line,
and at the eastern extremity of this sea -- I call that the eastern
extremity, where the land and the islands end.</p>

<p>Ptolemy and the other philosophers, who have written upon the globe,
thought that it was spherical, believing that this hemisphere was
round as well as that in which they themselves dwelt, the centre of
which was in the island of Arin, which is under the equinoctial line
between the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Persia; and the circle passes
over Cape St. Vincent, in Portugal, westward, and eastward, by Cangara
and the Seras, in which hemisphere I make no difficulty as to its
being a perfect sphere as they describe; but this western half of the
world, I maintain, is like the half of a very round pear, having a
raised projection for the stalk, as I have already described, or like
a woman\&rsquo;s nipple on a round ball.</p>

<p>Ptolemy and the others who have written upon the globe, had no
information respecting this part of the world, which was then
unexplored; they only established their arguments with respect to
their own hemisphere, which, as I have already said, is half of a
perfect sphere. [...]</p>

<p>On these grounds, therefore, I affirm, that the globe is not
spherical, but that there is the difference in its form which I have
described; the which is to be found in this hemisphere, at the point
where the Indies meet the ocean, the extremity of the hemisphere being
below the equinoctial line. And a great confirmation of this is, that
when our Lord made the sun, the first light appeared in the first
point of the east, where the most elevated point of the globe is; and
although it was the opinion of Aristotle, that the antarctic pole, or
the land under it, was the highest part of the world, and the nearest
to the heavens, other philosophers oppose him, and say, that the
highest part was below the arctic pole, by which reasoning it appears,
that they understood, that one part of the world must be loftier, and
nearer the sky, than the other; but it never struck them that it might
be under the equinoctial, in the way that I have said, which is not to
be wondered at, because they had no certain knowledge respecting this
hemisphere, but merely vague suppositions, for no one has ever gone or
been sent to investigate the matter, until now that your Highnesses
have sent me to explore both the sea and the land.</p>
