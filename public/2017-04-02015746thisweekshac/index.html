<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The United States Senate continues the war against their own
users. One Hackernews suspects some kind of massive federal
conspiracy to censor comments on reddit.com. Another suddenly
realizes that people might disagree about things for reasons other
than ignorance, and becomes distressed. The rest of the comments
are people arguing about technical methods to work around the
user-tracking they implement in their day jobs.</li>
<li>Google continues the war against their own users. The XMPP
Memorial Society trades barbs about whose fault it is that a
misdesigned overengineered shitshow of a protocol failed to gain
traction amongst non-erlang enthusiasts. Every single messaging
platform in current existence is held up as Obviously The Future.
Hackernews tries to figure out what Google\&rsquo;s master plan is, and
why Google is working so hard to make it look like aimless
poorly-managed floundering. IRCv3 continues to be a retarded pile
of solutions to the wrong problems.</li>
<li>The United States House of Representatives continues the war
against their own users. Hackernews is outraged, presumably
because the rules will now enable other companies to compete with
Google in the lucrative Fuck Everybody\&rsquo;s Privacy market sector.
The entire comment thread is just Hackernews arguing about
political shit and deciding which elected officials are betraying
the American people. Not a single goddamn Hackernews makes the
obvious connection to the shit they do at work all day for a
living. The tacit consensus: Hackernews isn\&rsquo;t bad for creating
the tools of surveillance capitalism; Congress is bad for letting
people use them.</li>
<li>Some academics figure out how to make shit in pictures look like
shit in other pictures. One Hackernews notices that the machine
learning papers have largely stopped relying on mathematics or any
other scientific endeavor; the others are ready with reassurances
that someone will get around to formal research sooner or later.
All this stuff is super worthwhile in the meantime because we can
just keep passing around training sets verbatim and treating them
as infallible, just like we do with node.js libraries! Both the
machine learning community and the web development community are
completely free of charlatans! Scout\&rsquo;s honor!</li>
</ul>
