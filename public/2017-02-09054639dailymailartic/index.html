<p>Date: 2017-02-09 05:46:39</p>

<p><a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/melania-trump-lawsuit-daily-mail-damage-opportunity-profit-first-lady"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/donald_trump_doesn_27t_love_his_wife.jpg" alt="" />World\&rsquo;s
smallest violin plays for non-former-escort Melania
Trump.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Melania Trump\&rsquo;s lawyers alleged in a lawsuit filed Monday that the
First Lady\&rsquo;s \&ldquo;unique once-in-a-lifetime\&rdquo; opportunity to profit from
her White House role was damaged by a Daily Mail article claiming she
once worked as an escort.</p>

<p>The suit, filed in New York State Supreme Court against the tabloid\&rsquo;s
owner, Mail Media, seeks compensatory and punitive damages of at least
\$150 million.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;Plaintiff had the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as an
extremely famous and well-known person, as well as a former
professional model and brand spokesperson, and a successful
businesswoman, to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple
product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million
dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which
plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world. These
product categories would have included, among other things, apparel,
accessories, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care, skin care and
fragrance.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The lawsuit alleges that Trump\&rsquo;s reputation was undermined at a
particularly opportune moment by the Mail article, which published
unsubstantiated allegations from a Slovenian magazine that the First
Lady had worked for an escort service. That article was eventually
retracted.</p>

<p>The First Lady\&rsquo;s lawyer, Charles Harder, announced on Tuesday that
she had agreed to settle for a \&ldquo;substantial sum\&rdquo; with a Maryland
blogger who also published a post about the escort allegations. In a
statement provided to TPM by Harder\&rsquo;s office, blogger Webster Tarpley
said his story was \&ldquo;replete with false and defamatory statements\&rdquo;
that he \&ldquo;fully\&rdquo; retracted.</p>

<p>Harder has been retained by many high-profile clients, includuing
disgraced Fox News CEO Roger Ailes. Last year, Trump ally Peter Thiel
paid Harder to represent former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan, whose given
name is Terry Bollea, in an invasion-of-privacy suit against Gawker
Media. The suit resulted in the media company\&rsquo;s bankruptcy.</p>
