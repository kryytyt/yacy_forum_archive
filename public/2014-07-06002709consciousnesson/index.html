<p><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329762.700-consciousness-onoff-switch-discovered-deep-in-brain.html?full=true#.U7h4U2K9KK1"><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/tumblr_m2qclrxuqt1qe0eclo1_r8_500.gif" alt="" />For
the first time, researchers have switched off consciousness by
electrically stimulating a single brain
area.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The woman has epilepsy so the team were using deep brain electrodes to
record signals from different brain regions to work out where her
seizures originate. One electrode was positioned next to the
claustrum, an area that had never been stimulated before.</p>
<p>When the team zapped the area with high frequency electrical impulses,
the woman lost consciousness. She stopped reading and stared blankly
into space, she didn\&rsquo;t respond to auditory or visual commands and her
breathing slowed. As soon as the stimulation stopped, she immediately
regained consciousness with no memory of the event.</p>
<p>To confirm that they were affecting the woman\&rsquo;s consciousness rather
than just her ability to speak or move, the team asked her to repeat
the word \&ldquo;house\&rdquo; or snap her fingers before the stimulation began.
If the stimulation was disrupting a brain region responsible for
movement or language she would have stopped moving or talking almost
immediately. Instead, she gradually spoke more quietly or moved less
and less until she drifted into unconsciousness. [...]</p>
<p>Anil Seth, who studies consciousness at the University of Sussex, UK,
warns that we have to be cautious when interpreting behaviour from a
single case study. The woman was missing part of her hippocampus,
which was removed to treat her epilepsy, so she doesn\&rsquo;t represent a
\&ldquo;normal\&rdquo; brain, he says.</p>
<p>However, he points out that the interesting thing about this study is
that the person was still awake. \&ldquo;Normally when we look at conscious
states we are looking at awake versus sleep, or coma versus vegetative
state, or anaesthesia.\&rdquo; Most of these involve changes of wakefulness
as well as consciousness but not this time, says Seth. \&ldquo;So even
though it\&rsquo;s a single case study, it\&rsquo;s potentially quite informative
about what\&rsquo;s happening when you selectively modulate consciousness
alone.\&rdquo;</p>
