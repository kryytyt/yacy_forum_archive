photograph teen\&rsquo;s erection in sexting case commits
suicide</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Detective David Edward Abbott, a member of the Northern
Virginia-Washington DC Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force,
last year had obtained a warrant to inject a young boy with a drug
that would cause an erection. Abbott wanted to photograph that
erection and compare it with photos found on a 15-year-old girl\&rsquo;s
phone. Amid a public outcry, the Manassas City police eventually
decided against doing that. The 17-year-old boy got a year of
probation for sexting his teen girlfriend. [...]</p>
<p>The authorities went to arrest Abbott, 39, on Tuesday. [...] Abbott
had an inappropriate relationship with a boy, now 13, police alleged.
He was accused of soliciting sexual acts on the phone, via text
messages and social media. Abbott was also accused of having an
\&ldquo;inappropriate relationship with a second male victim\&rdquo; affiliated
with the Prince William County hockey league.</p>
<p>The Manassas City Police Department, Abbott\&rsquo;s employer, lauded the
officer, saying in a statement:</p>
<p>This is a tragic and sad day for the Abbott family, the juvenile
victims and their families, the Manassas City Police Department, and
our community. In spite of these recent developments regarding the
serious allegations against him, we are grateful for the contributions
Det. Abbott made during his time with Manassas City Police, to include
the prosecution and conviction of hundreds of criminals. His family
and peers request privacy during this time as we grieve and struggle
to accept the realities of such a loss.</p>

and later tripped and fell on her as she lay asleep, accidentally
penetrating her vagina with his penis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The LAPD received 1,356 complaints of \&ldquo;biased policing\&rdquo; (AKA racial
profiling) from 2012-2014, but after investigating them, the
investigating officials decided that their co-workers had done nothing
wrong -- ever.</p>
