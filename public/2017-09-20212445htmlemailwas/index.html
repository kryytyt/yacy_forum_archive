<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I\&rsquo;m trying to figure out when HTML e-mails were first sent. Do you
happen to know if the Netscape Mail and News clients that you worked
on were the first MUAs to render HTML?</p>
<p>This question is in the context of struggling to craft an HTML
e-mail that looks \&ldquo;good\&rdquo; in every possible stupid mail program
that anyone could possibly still be using in the year 2011.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know, my gut reaction is that the answer to this question is
\&ldquo;no\&ldquo;, but after some digging, I have yet to find any evidence of a
mail reader that can display inline HTML messages (email or USENET)
that predates Netscape 2.0!</p>
<p>So, maybe?</p>
<p>If you find out for sure, please let me know!</p>
<p>I think there may have been closed systems inside Compuserve and
Outlook that supported rich text messages (in formats other than
HTML).</p>
<p>The Andrew Message System at CMU and MIT supported WYSIWYG rich
messages, including inline images and audio attachments, as early as
1985. Not HTML or MIME, but a predecessor to MIME, as the architect of
that was Nathaniel Borenstein who wrote the first MIME RFC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My other project is a time machine of course. First application:
preventing HTML e-mail from ever happening.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, go back to chipping your USENET posts out with a piece of flint,
why don\&rsquo;t you.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn\&rsquo;t the first, Netscape Mail was probably the first
mail reader that put the ability to easily <em>*view*</em> HTML messages in
front of more than a million users.</p>
<p>I know that Eudora 4 supported display of HTML email, and possibly
composition of it, but I\&rsquo;m not sure when that was released.</p>
<p>Qualcomm/Eudora spent a while trying to push text/enriched (RFC 1523,
published late 1993 -- not sure when Eudora first supported it) as an
alternative to HTML, but that went nowhere. Early versions of Netscape
(at least 1.1, I think possibly earlier) supported display of
text/enriched, but just about nobody was even aware of that because
nobody ever used it.</p>
<p>We also supported display of text/richtext, which was an HTML-like
SGML dialect with only a few tags. In 2.0b1 or possibly earlier. I
added that just to placate the peanut gallery, not because I expected
anyone to actually use it.</p>
<p>I think the only person who really used text/enriched was Brad
Templeton through ClariNet, where you could subscribe to USENET
newsgroups of the UPI/AP feeds that were formatted with it.</p>
<p>From Mosaic Netscape 0.9 through Netscape Navigator 1.1 (1994), there
was a mail composition window which allowed one to attach external
URLs. They were attached as MIME multipart/mixed attachments with
proper Content-Type and Content-Transfer-Encoding (using
quoted-printable to ensure short lines).</p>
<p>You could also \&ldquo;attach\&rdquo; things with \&ldquo;Include Document Text\&rdquo; which
would suck them in as plain-text with \&rdquo;&gt;\&rdquo; at the beginning of each
line, wrapped at 72 columns.</p>
<p>There was also a USENET news reader and composer built-in. The USENET
reader\&rsquo;s display of MIME documents was remedial at best. The
composition tool only allowed plain-text. Version 0.9 displayed any
part of a message between &lt;HTML&gt; and &lt;/HTML&gt; as such, even if
there was no Content-Type header. That was removed some time before
2.0. Back then, you couldn\&rsquo;t actually rely on a Content-Type header
propagating through multiple USENET hops -- bnews would strip out any
headers it didn\&rsquo;t know about!</p>
<p>(Remember that 1.1\&rsquo;s big innovation was <em>*tables*</em>. 1.0 didn\&rsquo;t
have \&lsquo;em!)</p>
<p>2.0 contained the mail reader, with full MIME support (which was also
a news reader, replacing the minimalist one that 1.0 had). So that
showed up in 1.22b or so, mid 1995, I guess?</p>
<p>I believe 3.0 was the first version with WYSIWYG HTML composition,
early 1996. To accomplish that in 2.0, you had to attach an HTML file.
If there was only one attachment, it was sent as the single MIME part.</p>
<p>Forwarded messages were attachments of type message/rfc822 and
included full headers, which were hidden upon inline display. Nobody
does that any more because now the world sucks.</p>
<p>There was the IETF MHTML working group as early as 1995. I can\&rsquo;t find
a working archive of the mailing list, but it was run by a fellow
named Jacob Palme --
<a href="http://people.dsv.su.se/~jpalme/ietf/jp-ietf-home.html">http://people.dsv.su.se/~jpalme/ietf/jp-ietf-home.html</a></p>
<p>Microsoft Outlook Express shipped in 2005 and did not support HTML,
but later versions (2006? Maybe 2008?) posted HTML <em>*by default*</em> to
both mail and news. This angered many. Outlook Express is also where
the blight of top-posting originated, those monsters.</p>
<p>Here, this may be helpful too:
