<p>Date: 2017-11-09 03:19:53</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/08/ashamed-to-work-in-silicon-valley-how-techies-became-the-new-bankers"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/2016/featured_games.jpg" alt="" />{sizes=&ldquo;(max-width: 660px) 50vw, 36em&rdquo;
srcset=&ldquo;https://www.jwz.org/images/2016/featured_games.jpg 490w, https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/360/2016/featured_games.jpg 360w&rdquo;}Wall
Street has long been the industry people love to hate. But as big
tech\&rsquo;s reputation plummets, suddenly a job at Facebook doesn\&rsquo;t seem so
cool.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;I would never say I worked at Facebook,\&rdquo; said one 30-year-old
software engineer who left the company last year to pursue an
alternative career. Instead, at dinner parties he would give
purposefully vague responses and change the subject. \&ldquo;There\&rsquo;s this
song and dance you learn to play because people are quick to judge.\&rdquo;
[...]</p>

<p>\&ldquo;We have this habit of highlighting and celebrating brilliant
assholes like Steve Jobs and Travis Kalanick, when the reality is they
are awful human beings,\&rdquo; said Greg, head of technology at e-commerce
startup Brandless, adding that it is women and people of colour who
tend to bear the brunt of their behaviour. [...]</p>

<p>Some of this behaviour stems from the hubris that positions
profit-seeking corporations as benevolent forces in the world.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;You are selling ads, you\&rsquo;re not really making the world a better
place,\&rdquo; noted the former Facebooker. \&ldquo;But most people drank the
Kool-aid.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>It\&rsquo;s a view echoed by one current Googler in her 20s, who is
embarrassed by tech companies\&rsquo; cluelessness about their reputation
outside of the Silicon Valley bubble.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;Internally I don\&rsquo;t think they have a good read on how they\&rsquo;re
perceived,\&rdquo; she said, citing the backlash after it was discovered
that ads were appearing around videos promoting extremist views on
YouTube or the investigation into possible Russian interference in the
US election, including buying ads on Google, Facebook and Twitter.</p>

<p>\&rdquo;[Googlers] will say \&lsquo;why are the papers making a big deal out of
this, I don\&rsquo;t get it\&lsquo;. Are you fucking joking? These people don\&rsquo;t
realise the scale of what they are doing,\&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;Some of these folks aren\&rsquo;t the most socially gifted people and
therefore suddenly having a culture encouraging this experience for
them bleeds into everything, giving them a sense of self-importance
and entitlement. It\&rsquo;s effectively like dealing with children all the
time,\&rdquo; Greg said, referencing his time at Dropbox when people would
\&ldquo;fly around the office on these stupid scooters and skateboards\&ldquo;.
[...]</p>

<p>All of this feeds into the perception that techies are, according to
the former Facebooker, \&ldquo;pod people\&rdquo; who aren\&rsquo;t part of the
community.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;You wake up, get the shuttle bus, go to the bubble of campus and
order food via an app when you get home. You are not a citizen, just a
bizarre leech who makes money,\&rdquo; he explained.</p>
