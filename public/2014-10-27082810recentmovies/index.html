<p><strong>Third Person:</strong> Well acted, but the schtick of \&ldquo;Look at these
unrelated stories we\&rsquo;re going to eventually tie together!\&rdquo; is pretty
tired. I admit that I completely failed to notice the <em>surprise twist</em>
at the end, but then, I also didn\&rsquo;t care. Every character in this movie
is a terrible person and I didn\&rsquo;t care about any of them. Dear writers:
please stop writing about writers.</p>

<p><strong>Maps to the Stars:</strong> It\&rsquo;s Cronenberg, so it\&rsquo;s creepy and well made,
but again, every single character in this movie is a terrible person and
I didn\&rsquo;t care about any of them. Dear Hollywood celebrities: please
stop writing about Hollywood celebrities.</p>

<p><strong>Zero Theorem:</strong> An autistic guy sits in his underwear playing
Minecraft on the set of <em>12 Monkeys</em> while extras from <em>The Fifth
Element</em> stop by to fuck with him. Nothing happens. Gilliam, what
happened to you?</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Peabody and Sherman:</strong> I needed to get the bad aftertaste of those
last three out of my system, ok? This was actually a lot funnier than it
had any right to be. And it took a weirdly dark turn at one point with
talking-dog/human racial politics.</p>

<p><strong>John Wick:</strong> This is fantastic! It\&rsquo;s basically <em>Red</em> if it was
directed by John Woo. The fight scenes are great, and people actually
run out of bullets.</p>

<p><strong>The Great Martian War:</strong> Apparently the Hitler Channel does low budget
SF now. It\&rsquo;s cute, some of the effects are good.</p>

<p><strong>Appleseed Alpha:</strong> I barely remember the first Appleseed, but I guess
this is a prequel? It blows up real good. The valley is getting less
uncanny. They ordered up most of the characters by calling Central
Casting and saying \&ldquo;send us the Luc Besson kit.\&rdquo; (Which is fine.)</p>

<p><strong>Life After Beth:</strong> Aubrey Plaza is a zombie. If you\&rsquo;re not sold by
that, I can\&rsquo;t help you. It\&rsquo;s pretty funny, using the <em>Shawn of the
Dead</em> formula of putting a screwball comedy in the middle of a
non-comedic zombie apocalypse.</p>

<p><strong>Constantine,</strong> s01e01: I am utterly shocked to report that this
didn\&rsquo;t suck. It\&rsquo;s very pilot-y, in that it\&rsquo;s full of exposition and
has too much tell-don\&rsquo;t-show, but I think it\&rsquo;s got potential. The
effects are great. Much zalgo, wow.</p>

<p><strong>Gotham,</strong> s01e01-05: I\&rsquo;ve watched the first few episodes of this even
though, as a police procedural, it\&rsquo;s Against Policy (\&ldquo;never watch
shows about doctors, lawyers or cops\&ldquo;) but it\&rsquo;s mean-spirited enough
that it has sucked me in. Gordon is a hat-rack that walks, but Oswald
Cobblepot is <em>fantastic</em>.</p>
