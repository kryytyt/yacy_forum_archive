<p>this asks more questions than it answers. they don\&rsquo;t really have
vestigial legs, like those aren\&rsquo;t even motile fins, so why do they
still have fully formed hips, why hasn\&rsquo;t the pelvic bone changed
significantly? and where did the tail come from?</p>
<p>[proto whale]</p>
<p>[orca skelly]</p>
<p>whales as we know them evolved from land animals that went back out to
sea, and it\&rsquo;s all spine all the way down to the tail fin. the pelvis
is vestigial to the point of being tiny and unrecognizable, and the
rear leg structure is <em>gone</em>. and by the time they evolved all that,
their forelegs had turned into proper fins and they didn\&rsquo;t have
hourglass figures, because they built up walls of insulating fat and
blubber where it was needed most - around the vital organs.</p>
<p>[walrus skelly]</p>
<p>which brings us to the walrus. as you can see the skeletal structure
and the external appearance are fairly ursiform - the rear legs are
basically still in there forming the tail, and the pelvis is intact,
and above that it may as well still be a land animal. if mermaids did
exist, as hominids who went back out to sea, and if they hadn\&rsquo;t
evolved into basically dolphins,
<a href="https://twitter.com/GuyP/status/591270054538412036"><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/beachbodyready.jpg" alt="" /></a>
then a walrus skeletal system, complete with vestigial thigh bones
inside a kind of muscle skirt, and with significant fat and blubber
deposits <em>on the main body</em> would be most likely. which is to say,
mermaids with human torsos and seagoing lower bodies would waddle
around on their tails, have clearly defined thigh structures, and
would be a hell of a lot rounder above and about the waist than
they\&rsquo;re usually depicted.</p>
<p>which begs the question, then, if you see a mermaid and it\&rsquo;s a skinny
little thing with a slinky waist and an eel-like tail and a perfect
bosom and a coy smile, <em>why does it look like that</em>? because whatever
that is? it is not a land animal that readapted to the sea. it is not
your distant kin. it is a sea creature that adapted <em>to get your
attention</em>.</p>
<p>maybe it\&rsquo;s all an illusion, a frilly mane, an hourglass shape, and
narrow antennae that mimic the shape of human arms, waving lonely
sailors into the water, only to realize too late the bioluminescent
patterns of lipstick and pert breasts are to distract from what lies
behind them - viselike jaws and row after row of stiletto teeth.</p>
<p>or maybe it\&rsquo;s all soft tissue, the gelatinous bell of a jellyfish
folded into a pleasing shape, luring the unwary down to be caught up
in a tail that is nothing more than thousands of barbed lines of
stinging neurotoxin cells.</p>
<p>or it could be that the tail goes deep into a shadowy well, and the
beautiful woman is a mask for a single enormous jaw, the internal
skeleton just the endless spine and ribs of a vast and hungry sea
snake.</p>
<p>or, perhaps most terrifyingly, the face is real but not the face of
the eyes looking out of it - a human mask for an intelligence both
cold and calculating, wearing an inviting smile to bring you within
reach of the dagger behind it\&rsquo;s back. waiting to slice the skin off
of you because it needs a new disguise, because it is shaped like you
but does not look like you, because it must pass as you so it can go
among you, so that by starlight it may go on land and into town, where
your kin are sleeping, unsuspecting.</p>
