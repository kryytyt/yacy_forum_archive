<p><a href="http://uncannymagazine.com/article/city-villains-dont-trust-batman/"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/4315967815_64407ab5c2_o.jpg" alt="" />Imagine that
you live in a city of
villains.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your city has a billionaire playboy. He lives on top of the hill. You
don\&rsquo;t know much about him, other than what you read in the papers
about his romantic exploits and elaborate black-tie parties. You had a
gig once offloading decorative antique suits of armor at his mansion
up on the hill. You wanted to sign up for the gig offloading slabs of
marble to be installed in his ballroom, but you hurt your back and got
fired.</p>
<p>You met the billionaire playboy once. You grew up in one of his
orphanages, after your Pop was killed by a villain and your Ma ran off
to make her fortune robbing banks in a souped-up mech suit. The
orphanage was nice, nicer than home even, because nobody there was
squirreling away your lunch money to pay for mech suit parts. You met
the billionaire playboy when he came through the orphanage to inspect
the place. There was a woman with a clipboard trailing behind him, and
she smiled at you. The billionaire ran his hands across the rows of
bedposts and looked into the distance, and you couldn\&rsquo;t catch his
eye.</p>
<p>After you hurt your back, your buddy tells you about a job he\&rsquo;s got
working in-house security at some guy\&rsquo;s warehouse downtown. You live
downtown. It would be nice to work close to where you live -- you
wouldn\&rsquo;t have to sit on the half-the-time-broke-down trolley that
goes from just outside the slums to the canning district, which is
your other employment option.</p>
<p>The billionaire playboy owns a lot of real estate in the city. That,
you learn through your buddy as you walk together to the security job,
is how the billionaire playboy\&rsquo;s family amassed their fortune. They
owned all the land before the city became a bustling urban metropolis.</p>
<p>You\&rsquo;re not sure whether he owns the slum where you live. You wonder
if your rent money pays for decorative antique suits of armor.</p>
