<p><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/they-live-poster_660.jpg" alt="" />Today in the bar
I was bitching to a friend about how HDMI is first a <em>restraint</em> and
only <em>second</em> a means of moving bits from point A to B, because it was
built with DRM from the ground up and therefore its designers notion of
fail [safe]{.underline} is that if there is any glitch at all, deliver
black rather than accidentally delivering something <em>unpermitted</em>, it
being a technology beholden to the media cartels, and if someone was
trying to design something that does what HDMI actually <em>succeeds at</em>
that thing would be called \&ldquo;ethernet\&ldquo;, oh, wait, that actually exists.</p>
<p>You know... bar talk...</p>
<p>And this fellow comes in and tells me that he knows exactly what I mean,
because the secret aliens who rule the world want to keep us helpless in
bondage and they use these technologies to keep us distracted.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Oh yeah?\&ldquo;, I said. I was intrigued by this alien business.</p>
<p>And he went on at some length, and I can\&rsquo;t say I really disagreed with
any of it, except that where he said \&ldquo;aliens\&rdquo; the words I would have
used would have been \&ldquo;corporations\&rdquo; or \&ldquo;Capitalism\&ldquo;. Terminology,
right? \&ldquo;You shouldn\&rsquo;t worry about TVs\&ldquo;, he said, \&ldquo;just put in a pool
table and teach the drunks geometry.\&rdquo; I mean, who can argue with that?
\&ldquo;I very much enjoy geometry, but music videos are pretty cool too,\&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>I think <em>They Live</em> was a brilliant movie, but I suspect that where this
fellow and I differ is that I <del>don\&rsquo;t think it was a documentary</del>...
no wait, I <em>absolutely do</em> think it was a documentary, I just think it
was a <em>metaphor</em>.</p>
<p>Or maybe I\&rsquo;m just woozy, because for decades they have been turning
<em>our</em> atmosphere into <em>their</em> atmosphere.</p>
