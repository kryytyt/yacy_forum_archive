<h1 id="standing-desk">Standing desk</h1>

<p>Date: 2014-06-22 00:10:31</p>

<p><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/desk.jpg" alt="" />A couple of months ago, I
switched to a standing desk. I figured I\&rsquo;d give it a try, after so many
years of reading how <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5879536/how-sitting-all-day-is-damaging-your-body-and-how-you-can-counteract-it">sitting will kill
you</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, I like it. It didn\&rsquo;t take any time at all for me to get used to
it, I don\&rsquo;t get tired or sore standing for hours at a time, and I\&rsquo;ve
noticed that my neck is basically never stiff any more. So it seems like
a solid plan!</p>

<p>I find that it makes me pace around a lot more. Without the overhead of
having to actually <em>lift my ass out of the chair</em>, I wander more when
I\&rsquo;m thinking, and I take my hands off the keys more often when I\&rsquo;m not
actually typing.</p>

<p>The biggest downside is that I couldn\&rsquo;t figure out a way to continue
using my beloved and long-discontinued <a href="http://www.jwz.org/images/img_1738.jpg">Kinesis
Evolution</a> chair-arm-mounted
keyboard (what with there no longer being a chair). I tried attaching it
to an arm, but that didn\&rsquo;t work out. The whole contraption was too
wobbly. So currently I\&rsquo;m using a <a href="https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-for-mac/">Kinesis
Freestyle2</a>, but
I don\&rsquo;t like it very much. The layout is ok, but the keys are mushy.</p>

<p>For the keyboard tray, I got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CM9NG1W/">Vivo laptop
arm</a>, which is adequate. I
got a 3\&lsquo;×1\&lsquo;×&frac12;\&rdquo; piece of plastic from
<a href="http://www.tapplastics.com/product/plastics/cut_to_size_plastic/abs_sheets/524">Tap</a>
to make it be wide enough for the hand separation I like.</p>

<p><strong>And now, for what I did wrong:</strong></p>

<p>Look, if you\&rsquo;re thinking of switching to a standing desk, don\&rsquo;t try to
do it halfway. Just commit. Raise the legs on your existing desk, or go
to Ikea and get an end-table that\&rsquo;s about the right size, cut its legs
to fit, and set that on top of your existing desk. Just do the obvious,
easy thing.</p>

<p>I decided that I should come up with something adjustable, in case some
days I wanted to sit. So I wanted to be able to bring my monitors and
keyboard back down to desk height as needed.</p>

<p>Well first of all, after standing at this desk for months, I have never
wanted to do that, so that was a waste of time.</p>

<p>There are motorized desks out there, but they look like slow, noisy and
expensive pieces of shit, so instead I went with monitor arms, thinking,
hey, just grab the thing and pull it to the position you want it in.</p>

<p>First problem: there aren\&rsquo;t very many monitor arms that will support a
35 pound iMac. The most promising-looking was the <a href="http://www.ergotechgroup.com/freedom-arm-imac.html">Ergotech Freedom
Arm</a>. That\&rsquo;s what I
got. Do not under any circumstances buy this. Here\&rsquo;s why it sucks:</p>

<ol>
<li>The mounting pole is too short. At maximum extension, it will only
bring the bottom edge of your monitor about 12\&rdquo; above the desk,
which isn\&rsquo;t nearly high enough to turn a sitting desk into a
standing desk. They don\&rsquo;t sell a longer pole. If you were designing
this product, you\&rsquo;d just use commodity threaded plumbing stock,
right? Of course they didn\&rsquo;t. I managed to find some pipe of the
right diameter, and with a second pipe inside and a bunch of duct
tape was able to shim it, and make it extend to the 20\&rdquo; I needed,
but that was a pain in the ass.</li>

<li><p>With the longer arm, you can\&rsquo;t just grab the monitor and move it
from \&ldquo;sitting\&rdquo; to \&ldquo;standing\&rdquo; height anyway. It doesn\&rsquo;t extend
that far. To change it that much, you\&rsquo;d need to undo the set screw
and re-adjust. So that was a waste of effort.</p></li>

<li><p>They have two models, one for iMacs and one with standard VESA
screws. If you were designing this product, you\&rsquo;d make one arm, and
ship a mounting shim with the Mac version (like, say,
<a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD179ZM/A/vesa-mount-adapter-kit-for-imac-andled-cinemaor-applethunderbolt-display">this</a>).
Of course they didn\&rsquo;t. They have a custom iMac-only head-end on the
arm, and it\&rsquo;s riveted in. So you can\&rsquo;t ever use the iMac version
with a non-iMac.</p></li>

<li><p>Oh guess what, by \&ldquo;iMac version\&rdquo; they mean \&ldquo;discontinued iMac
version\&ldquo;. Because you see, the old iMacs let you remove the leg to
mount this thing, but any iMac manufactured after 2011 no longer has
a removable leg! You have to order a different Mac with VESA screws
and no leg for that. And it\&rsquo;s not an option on the standard Apple
order-configuration page. There\&rsquo;s a <em>completely separate page</em> for
the VESA-screws iMac, with all the same configuration options as the
normal page.</p></li>

<li><p>And then -- it turns out that the VESA version of the Ergotech arm
can\&rsquo;t actually support the weight of an iMac. I don\&rsquo;t even
understand why this is, because they look physically identical,
except for the mount point, but it seems to be the case. Maybe they
put a wimpier spring in it or something. I had to splint it into the
fully-extended position with a piece of plumbing strap and a random
steel bar. Oh, the indignity.</p></li>

<li><p>So now you\&rsquo;ve got an old 2010 iMac to use as a hand-me-down at the
office. You take off the arm and put the leg back on. Oops, no you
don\&rsquo;t. The leg doesn\&rsquo;t go back on after the arm has had its way
with it. So now both your old and your new Mac are arm-only models.
Get used to it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What I\&rsquo;m saying is, forget the arms, just make your desk taller
somehow. This was a dumb mistake, even though it gives me more surface
area to clutter up. Also, the monitors wobble a little bit when I type,
which is irritating.</p>

<p>But, standing good!</p>
