<p>Date: 2016-10-13 02:54:10</p>

<p><a href="http://brokeassstuart.com/blog/2016/10/12/the-recall-ed-lee-campaign-has-officially-begun/"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/edleechrisgasconpostersdefaced.jpg" alt="" />The
Recall Ed Lee Campaign Has Officially
Begun:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Department of Elections just finally released the Official
Petition to Recall Ed Lee after 5 separate tries. The recall attempt
is now beginning in earnest. They need to get 60,000 signatures in the
next 160 days.</p>

<p>Let\&rsquo;s get this out of the way right here and now: Ed Lee\&rsquo;s time as
mayor of San Francisco has had the effect of being the fourth horseman
of the apocalypse for San Francisco. Under his watch, rents skyrocket
upwards, long-time residents of the city are being evicted, and
homelessness is reaching epidemic proportions. If Lee has been at war
with the soul of San Francisco, it could not be more apparent. For a
man who was handed the coveted title of Mayor of San Francisco by
Gavin Newsom, Lee opted to fuck a gift horse in the mouth in his
process of snuggling up to criminals and big businesses and turning
his back on the residents of San Francisco. [...]</p>

<p>Are you an SF resident and want to help the Recall Ed Lee Campaign?
It\&rsquo;s as easy as lending your signature to the recall petition! They
will be collecting them in front of the San Francisco Public Library
Wednesday to Saturday from noon to five. You can also get involved and
stay up to date by joining the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/recallmayorlee2016/">Recall Mayor Ed Lee FB
page</a>. Let\&rsquo;s get
this shit bag out so we can restore our magnificent home to its
gleaming glory.</p>

Billionaire Ron Conway Getting \&ldquo;Every Tech Employer\&rdquo; To Send Workers
His Voter
Guide:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday Joe Eskenazi <a href="https://twitter.com/EskSF/status/785968620509630466">tweeted this
email</a> from Ron
Conway in which Conway tries to use his weight to get every tech
employer to vote his way. This is not the first time he\&rsquo;s done this.
SF Magazine <a href="http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/ron-conway-emails-voter-guide-ceos-fails-grasp-ranked-choice-voting">reported
on</a>
the same scheme last year. [...]</p>

<p>While yes it is technically legal it is <em>hella</em> shady. The main
difference between an activist group or a union sending out a voter
guide is that they do not employ the people they are targeting. Ron
Conway has invested in over 500 tech companies and while none of those
are listed in the letter, the \&ldquo;and many others\&rdquo; obviously implies he
will be sending this to the CEOs of the companies who need Ron
Conway\&rsquo;s money for more backing. That is some fucked up shit!</p>

<p>It\&rsquo;s also shady that he\&rsquo;s asking the CEOs pretend that it\&rsquo;s just
some random voter guide they came across instead of one sent to them
BY THE GUY WHO PAYS THEM MONEY. Come on Ron we knew you were a slimy
creep but this is taking it too far.</p>

<p>What kind of slimy creep? I\&rsquo;m glad you asked! Ron Conway is also the
guy who bank rolled Ed Lee\&rsquo;s Reelection campaign -- after Ed Lee
enacted tax breaks for the companies Ron Conway invests in (like
twitter and AirBnB). Ron Conway also drops hundreds of thousands of
dollars into local campaigns to smear the reputations of solid
progressive candidates who are running against people Conway backs.
Independent expenditure committees funded by Conway have put out
propaganda in this election suggesting that a vote for Jane Kim is an
endorsement of domestic violence. He did the same thing against David
Campos in 2014.</p>
