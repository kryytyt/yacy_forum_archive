<p>Remember last month, when I was working on a screen saver and I
<a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/08/hellraiser/">reviewed all nine <em>Hellraiser</em>
movies</a> and made <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHyFLEMDXDQ">a
supercut of every on-screen appearance of the Lament
Configuration</a>?</p>

<p>As soon as I posted it, it was immediately blocked with seven content-ID
matches. So I filed a DMCA fair-use counter-claim, because this video
-- made of dozens of 5 second clips from these films for the purpose of
analyzing the special-effects techniques that went into them -- is
clearly fair use.</p>

<p>Well, yesterday they finally replied, and I thought you\&rsquo;d be interested
to know what that looks like, because it is the excrement of a bull and
it stinketh:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/copynotice?video_id=xHyFLEMDXDQ">Copyright Notice: The Lament Configuration,
Supercut</a></p>

<p>Your video may include clips that are owned by a third party. To watch
the matched clips please play the video on the right. The video will
play from the point where the matched content was identified.</p>

<p>Your video is blocked in some countries.</p>

<p>Copyright details:</p>

<ul>
<li>1:53: Visual content administered by:<br />
Starz Media LLC: <strong>Claim released.</strong></li>

<li><p>10:18: Visual content administered by:<br />
MegaTube: <strong>Claim released.</strong><br />
Miramax : <strong>Dispute rejected, claim has been reinstated.</strong></p></li>

<li><p>0:17: Visual content administered by:<br />
Starz Media LLC: -</p></li>

<li><p>8:10: Visual content administered by:<br />
MegaTube: <strong>Claim released.</strong></p></li>

<li><p>4:05: Visual content administered by:<br />
egeda: <strong>Dispute rejected, claim has been reinstated.</strong><br />
Image Entertainment: <strong>Dispute rejected, claim has been
reinstated.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have no idea who \&ldquo;MegaTube\&rdquo; is (those words are impossible to search
for) but I\&rsquo;m guessing they\&rsquo;re one of those companies that just files
copyright claims on <em>everything</em> in order to get adwords on it, and give
up as soon as someone complains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the others, and to nobody\&rsquo;s great surprise, how this works is you
say <em>\&ldquo;Fair use!\&rdquo;</em> and Youtube asks their corporate overlords what they
think. Then MPAA content mafia then replies, <em>\&ldquo;Well yes, that looks
like fair use to me, too! We\&rsquo;re so sorry that our robot, with no human
oversight, accused you of being a dirty thief.\&rdquo;</em> Just kidding, they
don\&rsquo;t even believe in the <em>concept</em> of fair use, so they say \&ldquo;no\&ldquo;.</p>

<p>The conversation we just had (and by \&ldquo;we\&rdquo; I mean \&ldquo;me and the
robots\&ldquo;) is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Robot: YOU ARE A THIEF</li>
<li>Me: This is fair use because XYZ</li>
<li>Robot: NO</li>
</ul>

<p>Nice that there is no explanation or justification for their opinion.</p>

<p>So after that, you have three options you can click:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>OK, got it</strong> (in a giant box, bigger than the other links below
it)</li>
<li>If you think this is an invalid claim, you can file a dispute.</li>
<li>If you still think this is an invalid claim, you can file an appeal.</li>
</ol>

<p>I already clicked #2 last time, so I don\&rsquo;t know why it\&rsquo;s still there,
so let\&rsquo;s see what happens when you click #3... You get a page that
has an \&ldquo;Error Dialog\&ldquo;-style box, with a big yellow MTA \&ldquo;warning
triangle\&rdquo; and everything, that says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Appeal reinstated claim</p>

<p><strong>Are you sure you want to appeal?</strong></p>

<p>You will be required to provide your contact information to the
claimant.</p>

<p>An appeal will result in either:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <strong>release of a claim on your video</strong></li>
<li>OR <strong>a legal copyright notification from the claimant.</strong> In this
event your <strong>video will be taken down</strong> and <strong>you will receive a
copyright strike</strong> on your account. If you have received
additional copyright strikes, this may suspend your YouTube
account <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000?hl=en">Learn
more</a></li>
</ul>

<p>OH NOES! If I dare to dispute their rejection of my claim, they\&rsquo;re
going to <em>know who I am</em> and there\&rsquo;s going to be a <em>legal hoo-ha
something-or-other!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, first of all, it\&rsquo;s obvious that they\&rsquo;re just trying to scare
people with the way they\&rsquo;re phrasing this here. \&ldquo;If you click this
button, terrible things will happen to you! The sky will darken with
lawyers!\&rdquo; They <em>intend</em> most people reading this, who don\&rsquo;t understand
how this works, to interpret that as \&ldquo;if you click this button,
someone\&rsquo;s going to sue you.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>But second, let\&rsquo;s look at the proposition they are actually making to
me right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Me: I believe this video is fair use.</li>
<li>Youtube: Other corporations disagree, and we trust them implicitly.
Your choices:
A.  Agree with us that you are a dirty lying dirty thief, and we\&rsquo;ll
    still allow it to play in <em>some</em> countries.
B.  Disagree with us, and <em>we\&rsquo;re going to take it down everywhere
    forever.</em> And I hope you know that <em>this will go down on your
    permanent record.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>How does that make any sense at all? If <em>today</em> it\&rsquo;s reasonable for it
to be un-blocked in some countries, how does my filing of an appeal
change that?</p>

<p>That\&rsquo;s just them being vindictive, and trying to discourage anyone from
ever filing an appeal.</p>

<p>So let\&rsquo;s ride this turd-train to the end and see what happens. I
clicked continue, and got this form:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your full name and contact information will be shared with Image
Entertainment,egeda.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your full legal name</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Street address, City, State/Province, ZIP/Postal code, Country</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You originally disputed the claim based on fair use. Please explain

<ul>
<li>Purpose and character of use:<br />
<em>(I said: \&ldquo;Nonprofit, educational use. It is an analysis of how
certain visual affects were achieved in nine different films.\&ldquo;)</em></li>

<li><p>Nature of copyrighted work:<br />
<em>(I said: \&ldquo;The material examined is from all of the nine
\&ldquo;Hellraiser\&rdquo; films.\&ldquo;)</em></p></li>

<li><p>The amount and substantiality of the portion used:<br />
<em>(I said: \&ldquo;Each clip is extremely short, roughly 5-20 seconds
each.\&ldquo;)</em></p></li>

<li><p>The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of,
the original work:<br />
<em>(I said: \&ldquo;None.\&ldquo;)</em></p></li>

<li><p>Please confirm your agreement with the following statement:<br />
I acknowledge that filing an appeal may lead to legal proceedings
between me and the complaining party to determine ownership. I am
aware that there may be adverse legal consequences in my country
if I make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process. I
understand the personal contact information I provided above will
be shared with the complaining party for purposes of my appeal and
consent to this disclosure. I acknowledge that this information
may be transmitted outside my home country as part of this
process.</p></li>

<li><p>Type your full name to serve as your electronic signature</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Incidentally, one of the countries in which this video is now blocked is
The United States of America. I wonder what countries it is <em>not</em>
blocked in?</p>
