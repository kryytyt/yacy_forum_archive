bugged <em>typewriters</em> in the US Embassy from 1976 through
1984.</a></p>
<p><em>This is an amazing story, and I also love that one of the players in
this drama is named \&ldquo;Bob Surprise\&ldquo;.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The typewriter bugs marked a new level of sophistication because they
were electromechanical. For the first time, the Soviets gathered
information from a piece of equipment that held written plain text
information. Prior to the discovery of these bugs, the U.S. believed
that the Russians had only used room audio bugs with micro- phones or
listening devices to eavesdrop on American embassy activities.
[...]</p>
<p>A total of sixteen bugs were found in twelve IBM Selectric II
typewriters and four IBM Selectric III typewriters. Common features
were found in all sixteen typewriters: six ferromagnetic magnetizable
balls were replaced with six nonferromagnetic nonmagnetizable balls
with a very strong magnet in the tip; all the typewriters contained a
modified comb support bar which housed the bug; all used burst
transmissions at the 30, 60, or 90 MHz range via radio frequency.
[...]</p>
<p>Each implant had a magnetometer that converted the mechanical energy
of key strokes into local magnetic disturbances. The electronics
package in the implant responded to these disturbances, categorized
the underlying data, and transmitted the results to a nearby listening
post. Data were transmitted via radio frequency. The implant was
enabled by remote control. Another advantage of these bugs was easy
installation. Engineers estimated that a skilled technician could
install an implant in a typewriter in a half hour. The integrated
circuits were very sophisticated for that time period. The circuits
contained one bit core memory, an advancement that NSA engineers had
never seen. [...]</p>
<p>In reality, the movement of the balls determined which character had
been typed because each character had a unique binary movement
corresponding to the balls. The magnetic energy picked up by the
sensors in the bar was converted into a digital electrical signal. The
signals were compressed into a four-bit frequency select word. The bug
was able to store up to eight four-bit characters. When the buffer was
full, a transmitter in the bar sent the information out to Soviet
sensors.</p>
<p>There was some ambiguity in determining which characters had been
typed. NSA analysts using the laws of probability were able to figure
out how the Soviets probably recovered text. Other factors which made
it difficult to recover text included the following: The implant could
not detect characters that were typed without the ball moving. If the
typist pressed space, tab shift, or backspace, these characters were
invisible to the implant. Since the ball did not move or tilt when the
typist pressed hyphen because it was located at the ball\&rsquo;s home
position, the bug could not read this character either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you enjoy this kind of thing, you should watch <em>The Americans</em>. It\&rsquo;s
a really fun show. There were times when I was watching <em>Agent Carter</em>
and I forgot which show I was watching because they\&rsquo;re basically both
about the Hydra Black Widow Program, but one of them has more boning and
the other has more kung fu.</p>
