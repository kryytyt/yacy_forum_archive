<p><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/30/how-growers-gamed-california-s-drought.html?via=desktop&amp;source=twitter"><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/road_warrior_lord_humongous.jpg" alt="" />Consuming
80 percent of California\&rsquo;s developed water but accounting for only 2
percent of the state\&rsquo;s GDP, agriculture thrives while everyone else is
parched.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Agriculture is the heart of California\&rsquo;s worsening water crisis, and
the stakes extend far beyond the state\&rsquo;s borders. Not only is
California the world\&rsquo;s eighth largest economy, it is an agricultural
superpower. It produces roughly half of all the fruits, nuts, and
vegetables consumed in the United States -- and more than 90 percent
of the almonds, tomatoes, strawberries, broccoli and other specialty
crops -- while exporting vast amounts to China and other overseas
customers.</p>
<p>But agriculture consumes a staggering 80 percent of California\&rsquo;s
developed water, even as it accounts for only 2 percent of the
state\&rsquo;s gross domestic product. Most crops and livestock are produced
in the Central Valley, which is, geologically speaking, a desert. The
soil is very fertile but crops there can thrive only if massive
amounts of irrigation water are applied.</p>
<p>Although no secret, agriculture\&rsquo;s 80 percent share of state water use
is rarely mentioned in media discussions of California\&rsquo;s drought.
Instead, news coverage concentrates on the drought\&rsquo;s implications for
people in cities and suburbs, which is where most journalists and
their audiences live. Thus recent headlines warned that state
regulators have ordered restaurants to serve water only if customers
explicitly request it and directed homeowners to water lawns no more
than twice a week. The San Jose Mercury News pointed out that these
restrictions carry no enforcement mechanisms, but what makes them a
sideshow is simple math: During a historic drought, surely the sector
that\&rsquo;s responsible for 80 percent of water consumption --
agriculture -- should be the main focus of public attention and
policy.</p>
<p>The other great unmentionable of California\&rsquo;s water crisis is that
water is still priced more cheaply than it should be, which encourages
over-consumption. \&ldquo;Water in California is still relatively
inexpensive,\&rdquo; Heather Cooley, director of the water program at the
world-renowned Pacific Institute in Oakland, told The Daily Beast.</p>
<p>One reason is that much of the state\&rsquo;s water is provided by federal
and state agencies at prices that taxpayers subsidize. A second factor
that encourages waste is the \&ldquo;use it or lose it\&rdquo; feature in
California\&rsquo;s arcane system of water rights. Under current rules, if a
property owner does not use all the water to which he is legally
entitled, he relinquishes his future rights to the unused water, which
may then get allocated to the next farmer in line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>If it makes you feel better about yourself, go ahead and let your
toilet stink or take shorter showers, but don\&rsquo;t pretend that will have
any kind of measurable effect. It\&rsquo;s nearly as pointless a placebo as
separating your trash is. All aggregate personal use can\&rsquo;t hope to even
compare to what is done at industrial scales. Remember: the damage that
BP did in the Gulf every five seconds completely obviated all the
recycling you personally ever did in your life.</em></p>
