<p><a href="http://www.keepgoing.org/issue20_giant/the_big_fish.html"><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/971125a.gif" alt="" /></a>Hey,
remember
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010709043951/%20http://www.suck.com/daily/1995/08/31/">Suck</a>?
This article is <em>ten years old</em> and is about a defunct web site <em>ten
years older than that</em>, but Suck was one of the best things to climb out
of the slime of the primordial web, and this retro-retrospective made me
all nostalgic.</p>
<p>Somewhere around a year in to Suck\&rsquo;s lifetime I was on \&ldquo;vacation\&rdquo; and
I read the whole site from the beginning in one sitting, and then sent
them a rambling stream-of-consciousness fan letter that didn\&rsquo;t have
much in the way of sentence- or paragraph breaks. Carl said, \&ldquo;You read
<em>all</em> of Suck? Even we don\&rsquo;t have the courage to do that,\&rdquo; and then he
sent me a t-shirt.</p>
<p>The other day this guy was interviewing me and we talked about Suck and
how it had managed to capture a snapshot of the festering shitstain that
passed for \&ldquo;tech culture\&rdquo; -- \&ldquo;Way better than fucking <em>Dilbert</em>
did\&ldquo;, I said -- and we laughed a dejected laugh.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.keepgoing.org/issue20_giant/the_big_fish.html">The Big Fish</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anuff learned that HotWired was hiring, and was soon invited for an
interview with Steadman and Bayers. \&ldquo;I don\&rsquo;t know what Carl saw in
me, other than somebody who probably believed in too many things, and
I think Carl relished the opportunity to crush those beliefs.\&rdquo;
[...]</p>
<p>Like Polly, the Suck office in Filler was a nastier, more contentious
place than its real-world counterpart, but not by much. \&ldquo;I\&rsquo;d say a
lot of it was driven by actual true stuff,\&rdquo; says Anuff. \&ldquo;I don\&rsquo;t
know if it was verbatim true. Heather is one colicky baby. She was
fighting with everybody. She used to go at it with Ana, with Carl,
with me, with Terry, with Matt. Oh my god, Matt Beer. And then Ana, of
course, is a terror, too. What a bunch of fucking babies. In some
sense it was the most unprofessional group of crybabies, prima donnas,
and problem employees. Everybody there was a problem. I don\&rsquo;t even
think I knew any better, because I was a problem too.\&rdquo;</p>
