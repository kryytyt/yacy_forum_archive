want to build. They\&rsquo;re in the
408.\&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>San Francisco lets Silicon Valley push it around like the school bully
in an \&lsquo;80s teen comedy. We\&rsquo;re at each other\&rsquo;s throats trying to
cope with soaring housing costs, while Silicon Valley gets off
scot-free for creating problems we get to solve.</p>

<p>Local governments dump housing problems onto the places that do build,
mostly San Francisco and Oakland. For example, late last year,
Mountain View approved plans to add 3.4 million square feet of office
space around the Google and LinkedIn fortresses, adding 20,000 jobs.
No new housing. Supposedly the newly elected City Council eventually
will vote to allow 1,500 to 5,000 units in the area, but the other
15,000 are San Francisco\&rsquo;s problem by default.</p>

<p>Sunnyvale, Milpitas, Palo Alto, Santa Clara and all these tedious
South Bay hamlets debase themselves to offer tech titans expansion
upon expansion to corporate campuses without any new housing. One UC
Davis study suggested those cities have a combined below-market-rate
housing deficit of 20,000 units. Mayor Ed Lee, I found locations for
the 30,000 units you want to build. They\&rsquo;re in the 408.</p>

<p>San Francisco should sue Mountain View and the rest of these fools.
San Francisco could challenge all these cities to adopt a Jobs-Housing
Linkage Program like we did years ago, to comply with their own
housing elements. Even to the point of bringing dreaded California
Environmental Quality Act lawsuits against big office projects that
don\&rsquo;t mitigate the housing problems they send us.</p>

<p>A relevant precedent is Urban Habitat v. the City of Pleasanton. State
law requires local governments to adopt a housing element with
land-use regulations to meet local housing needs. Pleasanton didn\&rsquo;t
comply with its own housing element and used a bunch of obscure zoning
gimmicks to prevent new housing from being built, especially
below-market-rate housing. Pleasanton lost in 2010 and had to rezone
and allow more below-market-rate housing. San Francisco could adapt
this approach to sue over the refusal to build in the deep south.</p>

<p>We progressives are accused of being NIMBYs, of reflexively opposing
higher density new development. I support lots of it. In Silicon
Valley. Build all the market-rate housing you want down there. I\&rsquo;ve
been to Mountain View. There\&rsquo;s nothing there worth preserving, except
Taqueria La Bamba on Rengstorff Avenue. Their carnitas is the rapture.
When I started stand-up, the bar Ron\&rsquo;s Farmhouse in Mountain View had
a weekly comedy night. That fetid hole of regret closed. Build a
50-story luxury condo tower there.</p>

<p>The reason these adorable towns resist more housing is basically
racism. It\&rsquo;s in the guise of alarms about \&ldquo;preserving neighborhood
character,\&rdquo; \&ldquo;school overcrowding\&rdquo; and \&ldquo;crime,\&rdquo; but that\&rsquo;s all
code for poor brown people. They moved to a subdivision in 65 percent
white Palo Alto to enjoy good schools and make little James Francos in
peace. Fine!</p>

<p>South Bay: You left a lot of your rich white people here in San
Francisco. Please come collect them. In San Francisco, we\&rsquo;re upset
about the displacement of working-class communities of color. You can
preserve your historic landmark whiteness and we\&rsquo;ll happily welcome
\&ldquo;those people\&rdquo; here. Bring your people home. That\&rsquo;s a win-win.</p>

<p>I know the techies in San Francisco feel embattled and beleaguered.
They\&rsquo;re blamed for things that are out of their control. I\&rsquo;m here
for you, Google Bus riders. I\&rsquo;m concerned that all the hours you
spend commuting are bad for your health. I want you to live close
enough to bike to work. Santa Clara and Sunnyvale are both
\&ldquo;All-America Cities.\&rdquo; There\&rsquo;s a sign on the freeway saying so. I
don\&rsquo;t know what that means, but I want you to have down time after
work to find out. You deserve linguica from Neto\&rsquo;s in Santa Clara.
Help me help you.</p>
