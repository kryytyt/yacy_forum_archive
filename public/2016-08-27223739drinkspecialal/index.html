juice:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>First mixed in World War II, it is made from pineapple juice and the
180-proof grain alcohol fuel used in United States Navy torpedo
motors. Various poisonous additives were mixed into the fuel alcohol
by Navy authorities to render the alcohol undrinkable, and various
methods were employed by the U.S. sailors to separate the alcohol from
the poison. Aside from the expected alcohol intoxication and
subsequent hangover, the effects of drinking torpedo juice sometimes
included mild or severe reactions to the poison, and the drink\&rsquo;s
reputation developed an early element of risk.</p>
<p>In the first part of the Pacific War, U.S. torpedoes were powered by a
miniature steam engine burning 180- or higher-proof ethyl alcohol as
fuel. The ethyl alcohol was denatured by the addition of 5 -- 10%
\&ldquo;pink lady\&ldquo;, a blend of dye, methanol and possibly other
ingredients. Methanol causes blindness when ingested, and cannot be
made non-poisonous. The methanol was said to be (largely) removed by
filtering the fuel mix through a compressed loaf of bread.</p>
<p>Later, a small amount of Croton oil was added to the neutral grain
spirits which powered U.S. torpedoes. Drinking alcohol with the oil
additive caused painful cramps, internal bleeding and a violent
emptying of the bowels. It was intended as a replacement for methanol
which had caused blindness in some sailors. To avoid the Croton oil,
sailors devised crude stills to slowly separate the alcohol from the
poison, as alcohol evaporated at a lower temperature than Croton oil.</p>

<p>Survey time!</p>
<p>Let\&rsquo;s say you had a device that used sugar for fuel. And you found that
your employees were putting some of that sugar in their coffee instead.
Would you:</p>
<p>A.  Implement better inventory control; or
B.  Cut the sugar with rat poison?</p>
<p>And if you chose B -- and you were <em>not</em> the government of a country
descended from religious fundamentalists and run by moralistic
prohibitionists -- how many consecutive life sentences do you think you
would serve in prison for attempted murder?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2245188/pagenum/all/">The Chemist\&rsquo;s War: The little-told story of how the U.S. government
poisoned alcohol during Prohibition with deadly
consequences:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frustrated that people continued to consume so much alcohol even after
it was banned, federal officials had decided to try a different kind
of enforcement. They ordered the poisoning of industrial alcohols
manufactured in the United States, products regularly stolen by
bootleggers and resold as drinkable spirits. The idea was to scare
people into giving up illicit drinking. Instead, by the time
Prohibition ended in 1933, the federal poisoning program, by some
estimates, had killed at least 10,000 people.</p>
<p>Although mostly forgotten today, the \&ldquo;chemist\&rsquo;s war of Prohibition\&rdquo;
remains one of the strangest and most deadly decisions in American
law-enforcement history. As one of its most outspoken opponents,
Charles Norris, the chief medical examiner of New York City during the
1920s, liked to say, it was \&ldquo;our national experiment in
extermination.\&rdquo; [...]</p>
<p>Industrial alcohol is basically grain alcohol with some unpleasant
chemicals mixed in to render it undrinkable. The U.S. government
started requiring this \&ldquo;denaturing\&rdquo; process in 1906 for
manufacturers who wanted to avoid the taxes levied on potable spirits.
[...] By mid-1927, the new denaturing formulas included some
notable poisons -- kerosene and brucine (closely related to
strychnine), gasoline, benzene, cadmium, iodine, zinc, mercury salts,
nicotine, ether, formaldehyde, chloroform, camphor, carbolic acid,
quinine, and acetone. The Treasury Department also demanded more
methyl alcohol be added -- up to 10 percent of total product. It was
the last that proved most deadly.</p>
