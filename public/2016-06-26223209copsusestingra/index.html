<p>Date: 2016-06-26 22:32:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160507/11342334371/your-tax-dollars-work-cops-use-stingray-to-almost-track-down-suspected-fast-food-thief.shtml"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/this_phone_is_tapped.jpg" alt="" />\&ldquo;When a cell
site simulator is deployed, it gathers cell phone info from everyone in
the surrounding area, including those whose chicken wings have been
lawfully
purchased.\&rdquo;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Annapolis\&rsquo; log shows police located their target in seven of the 17
cases in which the [Stingray] equipment was used since late 2011.</p>
<p>Annapolis Police couldn\&rsquo;t find their target in the case of a Pizza
Boli\&rsquo;s employee who reported being robbed of 15 chicken wings and
three subs while out on delivery in March. In that case, police got
a court order, according to the police log.</p>
<p>The value of the wings and subs totaled \$56.77.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Law enforcement spokespeople will often point to the handful of
homicide or kidnapping investigations successfully closed with the
assistance of cell site simulators, but they\&rsquo;ll gloss over the
hundreds of mundane deployments performed by officers who will use
anything that makes their job easier -- even if it\&rsquo;s a tool that\&rsquo;s
Constitutionally dubious.</p>
<p>Don\&rsquo;t forget, when a cell site simulator is deployed, it gathers cell
phone info from everyone in the surrounding area, including those
whose chicken wings have been lawfully purchased. And all of this data
goes... somewhere and is held onto for as long as the agency feels
like it, because most agencies don\&rsquo;t seem to have Stingray data
retention policies in place until after they\&rsquo;ve been
FOIA\&lsquo;ed/questioned by curious legislators.</p>
<p>Regular policework -- which seemed to function just fine without cell
tracking devices -- now apparently can\&rsquo;t be done without thousands
of dollars of military equipment. And it\&rsquo;s not just about the chicken
wing thieves law enforcement can\&rsquo;t locate. It\&rsquo;s about the murder
suspects who are caught but who walk away when the surveillance device
wipes its feet on the Fourth Amendment as it serves up questionable,
post-facto search warrants and pen register orders.</p>
