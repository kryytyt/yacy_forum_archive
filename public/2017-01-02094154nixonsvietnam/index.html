<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/07/he-was-a-crook/308699/"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/600px-pbreak-00022.jpg" alt="" /></a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/opinion/sunday/nixons-vietnam-treachery.html">Now
we know Nixon
lied.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A newfound cache of notes left by H. R. Haldeman, his closest aide,
shows that Nixon directed his campaign\&rsquo;s efforts to scuttle the
[Vietnam] peace talks, which he feared could give his opponent, Vice
President Hubert H. Humphrey, an edge in the 1968 election. On Oct.
22, 1968, he ordered Haldeman to \&ldquo;monkey wrench\&rdquo; the initiative.</p>
<p>The 37th president has been enjoying a bit of a revival recently, as
his achievements in foreign policy and the landmark domestic
legislation he signed into law draw favorable comparisons to the
presidents (and president-elect) that followed. [...] Haldeman\&rsquo;s
notes return us to the dark side. Amid the reappraisals, we must now
weigh apparently criminal behavior that, given the human lives at
stake and the decade of carnage that followed in Southeast Asia, may
be more reprehensible than anything Nixon did in Watergate. [...]</p>
<p>In a conversation with the Republican senator Everett Dirksen, the
minority leader, Johnson lashed out at Nixon. \&ldquo;I\&rsquo;m reading their
hand, Everett,\&rdquo; Johnson told his old friend. \&ldquo;This is treason.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;I know,\&rdquo; Dirksen said mournfully.</p>
<p>Johnson\&rsquo;s closest aides urged him to unmask Nixon\&rsquo;s actions. But on
a Nov. 4 conference call, they concluded that they could not go public
because, among other factors, they lacked the \&ldquo;absolute proof,\&rdquo; as
Defense Secretary Clark Clifford put it, of Nixon\&rsquo;s direct
involvement.</p>
<p>Nixon was elected president the next day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/07/he-was-a-crook/308699/">Maybe now\&rsquo;s a good time to re-read Hunter S. Thompson obituary of this
fine
American:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the right people had been in charge of Nixon\&rsquo;s funeral, his casket
would have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that
empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a
man and a jabbering dupe of a president. [...] Let there be no
mistake in the history books about that. Richard Nixon was an evil man
-- evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality
of the Devil can understand it. He was utterly without ethics or
morals or any bedrock sense of decency. Nobody trusted him -- except
maybe the Stalinist Chinese, and honest historians will remember him
mainly as a rat who kept scrambling to get back on the ship. [...]</p>
<p>Some people will say that words like <em>scum</em> and <em>rotten</em> are wrong for
Objective Journalism -- which is true, but they miss the point. It
was the built-in blind spots of the Objective rules and dogma that
allowed Nixon to slither into the White House in the first place. He
looked so good on paper that you could almost vote for him sight
unseen. He seemed so all-American, so much like Horatio Alger, that he
was able to slip through the cracks of Objective Journalism. You had
to get Subjective to see Nixon clearly, and the shock of recognition
was often painful. [...]</p>
<p>Nixon\&rsquo;s spirit will be with us for the rest of our lives -- whether
you\&rsquo;re me or Bill Clinton or you or Kurt Cobain or Bishop Tutu or
Keith Richards or Amy Fisher or Boris Yeltsin\&rsquo;s daughter or your
fiancee\&rsquo;s 16-year-old beer-drunk brother with his braided goatee and
his whole life like a thundercloud out in front of him. This is not a
generational thing. You don\&rsquo;t even have to know who Richard Nixon was
to be a victim of his ugly, Nazi spirit.</p>
<p>He has poisoned our water forever. Nixon will be remembered as a
classic case of a smart man shitting in his own nest. But he also shit
in our nests, and that was the crime that history will burn on his
memory like a brand. By disgracing and degrading the Presidency of the
United States, by fleeing the White House like a diseased cur, Richard
Nixon broke the heart of the American Dream.</p>
