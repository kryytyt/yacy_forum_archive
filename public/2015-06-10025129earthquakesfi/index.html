<p><a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-tech-money-is-destroying-the-streets-of-san-francisco-2015-06-08"><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/bath-d-new.jpg" alt="" />Back in my day, we washed
our hands in a different room from the one we pooped in, and we <em>liked</em>
it that
way!</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;People are buying Victorians and they are going super modern,\&rdquo; said
Scott Bowles, former manager of San Francisco Victoriana, a supplier
of building materials for restoring Victorian homes, which closed in
April. \&ldquo;They are ruining the city.\&rdquo; [...]</p>

<p>Victorian-era architecture is not unique to San Francisco, of course.
But many of the city\&rsquo;s wooden homes with turrets and gingerbread
details produced at the state\&rsquo;s redwood mills were often designed by
local architects, built by the same group of developers, or assembled
from parts ordered from the Sears catalog. They often have distinct
features and only -- in -- San Francisco traits, such as their bay
windows, and are staggered up the city\&rsquo;s hills. Some of the most
over-the-top designs and extraneous details were ridiculed in their
own time, it should be noted.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;It seems somehow cruel that many Victorians with intact interiors,
that survived earthquakes, fires and hippies are having their stuffing
ripped out so that the new owners can have a house that looks like a
condo in Foster City,\&rdquo; said Christopher VerPlanck, principal of
VerPlanck Historic Preservation Consulting in San Francisco. [...]</p>

<p>Many owners want to create open floor plans, just like their tech
offices, a design which is in sharp contrast to the narrow Victorian
layouts of the late 1880s and early 1900s, which comprise many small
rooms, each with their own fireplaces and heavy pocket doors, designed
to keep in the heat.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;I have to ask why they seem to target Victorians when there are lots
of more contemporary buildings that they could [apply] this
treatment to,\&rdquo; VerPlanck added. \&ldquo;When the remodel is done, often the
only thing left is the facade, which they may or may not do a nice job
of restoring. ... As more of these happen, San Francisco is turing
into a Potemkin Village of itself. No history. No patina. Nothing is
lived-in. Everything looks like a Dwell magazine spread.\&rdquo;</p>
