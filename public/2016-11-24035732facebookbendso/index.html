<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/technology/facebook-censorship-tool-china.html?_r=4">Facebook: Still Literally the
Worst</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The social network has quietly developed software to suppress posts
from appearing in people\&rsquo;s news feeds in specific geographic areas,
according to three current and former Facebook employees, who asked
for anonymity because the tool is confidential. The feature was
created to help Facebook get into China, a market where the social
network has been blocked, these people said. Mr. Zuckerberg has
supported and defended the effort, the people added. [...]</p>

<p>Facebook does not intend to suppress the posts itself. Instead, it
would offer the software to enable a third party -- in this case,
most likely a partner Chinese company -- to monitor popular stories
and topics that bubble up as users share them across the social
network, the people said. Facebook\&rsquo;s partner would then have full
control to decide whether those posts should show up in users\&rsquo; feeds.
[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>\&rdquo;<em>We</em> won\&rsquo;t actually censor anything -- we\&rsquo;ll just give unfettered
access and control to the Chinese government.\&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The suppression software has been contentious within Facebook, which
is separately grappling with what should or should not be shown to its
users after the American presidential election\&rsquo;s unexpected outcome
spurred questions over fake news on the social network. Several
employees who were working on the project have left Facebook after
expressing misgivings about it, according to the current and former
employees. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>\&ldquo;Several Facebook employees discovered that they do, in fact, have
ethics, claim anonymous sources.\&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some analysts have said Facebook\&rsquo;s best option is to follow a model
laid out by other internet companies and cooperate with a local
company or investor. Finding a partner -- and potentially allowing it
to own a majority stake in Facebook\&rsquo;s China operation -- would take
the burden of censorship and surveillance off the Silicon Valley
company. It would also let Facebook rely on a local company\&rsquo;s
government connections and experience to deal with the difficult task
of communicating with Beijing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>\&ldquo;When an American company wants to cave to the demands of a foreign
totalitarian regime, it always plays better in the media to do so
through a shell company.\&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/23/facebook-china-censorship-is-a-huge-betrayal-commentary.html">Facebook\&rsquo;s descent into the rabbit hole of censorship is
suicidal:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the intent here is the real problem. In the first place, it shows
a decidedly broken moral compass. You know how they keep telling us
that open and free trade and relations with totalitarian countries
will someday soon lead to more freedom in those countries as its
people become more and more exposed to our way of life?</p>

<p>All of that goes out the window when the businesses and politicians
trading and dealing with those countries agree to censor the things
that make free society free in the first place. Facebook is guilty of
this every time it agrees to erase even the evidence of American
political free speech with censorship. Politicians are guilty of this
every time a female American envoy agrees to ignore our firm belief in
religious pluralism by donning a hijab when visiting even
non-religious sites in a Muslim country. The list goes on, but the
exchange of free ideas and principles is killed by these kinds of
unjustified concessions and they destroy the very best reasons for
international relations.</p>

<p>Hey, remember when <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2012/02/twitters-pr-department-is-more-skilled-than-i-thought/">Twitter pulled this same
shit</a>
and nobody cared?</p>
