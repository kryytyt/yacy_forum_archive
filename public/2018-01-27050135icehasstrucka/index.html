<p>Date: 2018-01-27 05:01:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/26/16932350/ice-immigration-customs-license-plate-recognition-contract-vigilant-solutions">The system gives the agency access to billions of license plate records
and new powers of real-time location
tracking.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vigilant Solutions has amassed a database of more than 2 billion
license plate photos by ingesting data from partners like vehicle
repossession agencies and other private groups. Vigilant also partners
with local law enforcement agencies, often collecting even more data
from camera-equipped police cars. The result is a massive
vehicle-tracking network generating as many as 100 million sightings
per month, each tagged with a date, time, and GPS coordinates of the
sighting.</p>
<p>ICE agents would be able to query that database in two ways. A
historical search would turn up every place a given license plate has
been spotted in the last five years, a detailed record of the
target\&rsquo;s movements. That data could be used to find a given
subject\&rsquo;s residence or even identify associates if a given car is
regularly spotted in a specific parking lot. [...]</p>
<p>ICE agents can also receive instantaneous email alerts whenever a new
record of a particular plate is found [...] With sightings flooding
in from police dashcams and stationary readers on bridges and toll
booths, it would be hard for anyone on the list to stay unnoticed for
long. [...]</p>
<p>The biggest concern for critics is the sheer scale of Vigilant\&rsquo;s
network, assembled almost entirely outside of public accountability.
\&ldquo;If ICE were to propose a system that would do what Vigilant does,
there would be a huge privacy uproar and I don\&rsquo;t think Congress would
approve it,\&rdquo; Stanley says. \&ldquo;But because it\&rsquo;s a private contract,
they can sidestep that process.\&rdquo;</p>

ICE
Raids:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly planning
massive sweeps in Northern California in response to Gov. Jerry
Brown\&rsquo;s signing of the California Values Act, a law that prohibits
the use of local and state tax dollars to assist in federal civil
immigration enforcement. [...]</p>
<p>\&ldquo;ICE\&rsquo;s threats are outrageous and designed to terrorize immigrant
community members. But we will not be afraid. Our highly trained staff
stands ready to defend the rights of all San Franciscans regardless of
immigration status,\&rdquo; said Adachi.</p>
<p>There is no evidence to support claims made by ICE officials that
sanctuary policies compromise public safety, and a host of studies,
including one from the Journal of Law and Economics, that found no
correlation between public safety and increased deportation. There is
little dispute that immigrants commit fewer crimes than citizens. And,
the Center of American Progress found that sanctuary jurisdictions are
actually safer than those without sanctuary policies.</p>
<p>ICE regularly engages in enforcement action without any judicial
oversight. Under the Bush Administration, ICE agents routinely raided
homes without warrants, where they arrested people on sight, often
breaking up families in the middle of the night. ICE often acts in
secret, and provides very little information to the public about their
operations.</p>
