<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brick-brick/201507/steve-albini-shows-punk-rock-ethics-are-good-business"><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/screen_shot_2015-07-07_at_9.38.41_am.png" alt="" />\&ldquo;If
you start from the premise of refusing to be an asshole, then a lot of
other decisions kind of make
themselves.\&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;There are kind of two perspectives on business. One of them is that
a business exists to make money for the investor class that has a
stake in that business. That\&rsquo;s one perspective. So, from a
stock-market perspective, from a shareholder perspective, from an
investor perspective, that from any publicly held company\&rsquo;s
perspective, the company\&rsquo;s reason to exist is to make money for those
people,\&rdquo; he explained. \&ldquo;And if you\&rsquo;re not making money, you\&rsquo;re a
failing company. If its share price doesn\&rsquo;t go up, then the
company\&rsquo;s failing, whether you\&rsquo;re making a profit or not. The idea
is that the fundamental reason for that company to be there is to make
money.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>Albini contrasts this approach to how he runs his business. \&ldquo;From an
entrepreneurial standpoint, from someone like me -- someone who
builds a business for a reason -- the reason my company exists is to
make recordings of music. And in so doing, every now and again we\&rsquo;ll
turn a profit. But that\&rsquo;s not why we\&rsquo;re in business. We\&rsquo;re not in
business so that we can make money. And there\&rsquo;s a pretty strong
argument that most businesses that are not part of the public sphere,
not part of the investment transaction or equity management or
whatever, most businesses operate on that level,\&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;Like a bakery opens because a guy wants to make bread. A tavern
opens because a guy wants to serve beer to people. That\&rsquo;s why people
start businesses. It\&rsquo;s because they want to do something with their
time. They want that enterprise to be how they spend their days. But
from an academic standpoint or from an analytical standpoint or from
the standpoint of publicly held companies and investment class and
everything, the reason the company started is meaningless. All they
want to know is the share price going up. And for people like me that
seems insane.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>\&ldquo;It\&rsquo;s like defining a marriage by the size of the house it occupies
as opposed to defining the marriage by the love between two people and
the life they build for themselves and the experience they share as
part of the marriage. [...]</p>

<p>\&ldquo;If I see a competitor studio that\&rsquo;s having trouble with something
that\&rsquo;s a problem that we\&rsquo;ve solved here at Electrical Audio, I\&rsquo;m
not going to keep that information to myself and watch them flounder.
I\&rsquo;m going to share that information with them. And that from a
\&lsquo;business\&rsquo; standpoint is a mistake -- from a corporate thinking Art
of War, Sun Tzu bullshit kind of scenario -- that\&rsquo;s a mistake.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>\&ldquo;But from being a decent person seeing someone else in trouble and
helping them out standpoint, that\&rsquo;s just being a decent person. And
that\&rsquo;s where I feel like if your basic principles are based in these
business precepts, you\&rsquo;re prevented from being the best possible
person. You\&rsquo;re prevented from being a good guy.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>\&ldquo;I think that it\&rsquo;s an ethical way to conduct myself; otherwise, I
wouldn\&rsquo;t do it. I do think it\&rsquo;s ethically sound to treat everyone
fair and to be open and equal in your treatment of everybody and to be
inclusive of everybody. I think that is an ethical thing to do,\&rdquo; he
said. \&ldquo;And I have less respect for the profit motive. In fact, I kind
of feel like the profit motive is a pathology, because it engenders
sociopathic behavior, and on a corporate scale, the profit motive is
extraordinarily destructive. So I don\&rsquo;t have respect for it. But
because of the way capitalism has been portrayed in this country, I
don\&rsquo;t expect other people to think that way.\&rdquo;</p>
