<p>Date: 2015-10-26 05:25:15</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/exxon-knew-everything-there-was-to-know-about-climate-change-by-the-mid-1980s-and-denied-it/"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/140319173806-exxon-oil-04-restricted.jpg" alt="" />And
thanks to their willingness to sucker the world, the world is now a
chaotic
mess.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This one comes from months of careful reporting by two separate teams,
one at the Pulitzer Prize-winning website <a href="http://insideclimatenews.org/news/18092015/exxon-confirmed-global-warming-consensus-in-1982-with-in-house-climate-models">Inside Climate
News</a>,
and the other at the <a href="http://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-arctic/">Los Angeles
Times</a> (with an assist from
the Columbia Journalism School). Following separate lines of evidence
and document trails, they\&rsquo;ve reached the same bombshell conclusion:
ExxonMobil, the world\&rsquo;s largest and most powerful oil company, knew
everything there was to know about climate change by the mid-1980s,
and then spent the next few decades systematically funding climate
denial and lying about the state of the science. [...]</p>
<p>A few observers, especially on the professionally jaded left, have
treated the story as old news -- as something that even if we didn\&rsquo;t
know, we knew. \&ldquo;Of course they lied,\&rdquo; someone told me. That
cynicism, however, serves as the most effective kind of cover for
Exxon (right alongside the tired argument that it\&rsquo;s \&ldquo;not the fault
of the companies -- they\&rsquo;re just meeting demand from all of us\&ldquo;).
What\&rsquo;s beginning to sink in is the horrible impact of their lies:
Exxon, had its leaders merely stated directly what they knew to be
true, could have ended the pretend debate over climate change as early
as the 1980s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2015_10/exxon_feeling_the_heat_for_cov058170.php">Washington
Monthly:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fossil fuel company intentionally and knowingly obfuscating research
into climate change constitutes criminal negligence and malicious
intent at best, and a crime against humanity at worst. The Department
of Justice has a moral obligation to prosecute Exxon and its
co-conspirators accordingly.</p>
