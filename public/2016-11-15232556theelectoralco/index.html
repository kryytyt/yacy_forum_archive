<h1 id="the-electoral-college-was-designed-to-prevent-trump-you-can-make-this-happen">The Electoral College Was Designed To Prevent Trump. You Can Make This Happen.</h1>

<p>Date: 2016-11-15 23:25:56</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/douglas-anthony-cooper/the-electoral-college-was_b_12897066.html">Trump can still be stopped. The Founding Fathers foresaw just this
catastrophe, and built a fail-safe into the
Constitution.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It\&rsquo;s called the Electoral College. Alexander Hamilton was explicit:
this mechanism was designed to ensure that \&ldquo;the office of president
will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree
endowed with the requisite qualifications.\&rdquo; In short, it was designed
to prevent just this situation: the rise of an unqualified demagogue
like Donald Trump.</p>

<p>You can make it do what it was meant to do.</p>

<p>The requirement here is modest: a small group of Republican electors
must be persuaded to vote their conscience. No question that many of
these are appalled at the prospect of a Trump presidency; surely a few
are courageous enough to cast a vote for someone else. (Most if not
all would vote for another Republican, of course; it doesn\&rsquo;t seem
likely that many would choose Hillary Clinton.) Depending upon how
current recounts turn out, somewhere between a minimum of ten and a
maximum of thirty-seven electors would have to defect in order to
bring Trump\&rsquo;s count down to less than 270.</p>

<p>If neither party ends up with 270 votes, then the decision passes to
the House of Representatives, and a vote in that chamber determines
the winner. The House is permitted to choose from among the three
candidates who receive the most votes in the Electoral College. Hence,
dissenting electors can rest assured that they -- and the voters they
represent -- will end up with a Republican president. [...]</p>

<p>Why should Democrats fight for this? Because any conceivable choice on
the part of the Electoral College and the House, however extreme,
would be preferable to Trump.</p>

<p>This would not be an abuse of the Constitution. Quite the opposite, as
I say: it would be the proper use of the Constitution to prevent the
abuse of a general election. The Founding Fathers would have approved.
More: they would have been distressed to see this not happen, given
the circumstances. They chose to found a republic that was not a
direct democracy, and this is why: a simple binding majority vote
provides no check upon the election of a tyrant. (This election was an
exception, ironically: Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, and
direct democracy would have spared the world the terrifying promise of
a Trump presidency.) [...]</p>

<p>So, how do you accomplish this? The process is simple: write to
electors in states that went red, and beg them to vote their
conscience. The complete list of relevant electors can be found here,
with contact information: <a href="http://flipthe37.blogspot.com/">\&ldquo;Flip the
37.\&rdquo;</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/electoral-college-electors-electoral-college-make-hillary-clinton-president-on-december-19">Change.org Petition: Electoral College Electors: Make Hillary Clinton
President on December
19</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states\&rsquo; votes and cast
their ballots for Secretary Clinton. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. Trump is unfit to serve. His scapegoating of so many Americans,
and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual
assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the
Republic.</p>

<p>Secretary Clinton won the popular vote and should be President.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>idea</em> behind the Electoral College is that the people can\&rsquo;t be
directly trusted, and instead appoint a set of grown-ups to make the
actual decisions for them. It\&rsquo;s the same reason we have a Congress and
Senate instead of just letting everyone vote on laws directly.</p>

<p>However, in <em>practice</em> what the Electoral College does is disenfranchise
huge parts of the country, because its dynamics ensure that Presidential
campaigns only really happen in about six contentious states, which are
neither the most populous nor the most typical. The candidates focus
their campaigns on those states, and the topics that resonate most with
those states, and ignore the rest of the country. That\&rsquo;s why Ohio and
Florida get to decide who our President is, and California largely
doesn\&rsquo;t matter, despite having more than twice their combined
population.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.nationalpopularvote.com/pages/faqitem.php?f=4">What are the Major Shortcomings of the Current System of Electing the
President?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, voters are effectively disenfranchised in two thirds of the
states in presidential elections. Under the now-prevailing statewide
winner-take-all rule, presidential candidates do not campaign in
states in which they are far ahead because they do not receive any
additional electoral votes by winning such states by a larger margin.
Similarly, candidates ignore states where they are far behind because
they have nothing to gain by losing those states by a smaller margin.
Instead, presidential candidates concentrate their public appearances,
organizational efforts, advertising, polling, and policy attention on
states where the outcome of the popular vote is not a foregone
conclusion. In practical political terms, a vote matters in
presidential politics only if it is cast in a closely divided
battleground state. To put it another way, the question of whether a
voter matters in presidential politics depends on whether other voters
in the voter\&rsquo;s own state happen to be closely divided. In the five
most recent presidential elections (1988 -- 2004), about two thirds
of the states have been non-competitive, including six of the
nation\&rsquo;s 10 most populous states (California, Texas, New York,
Illinois, New Jersey, and North Carolina), 12 of the 13 least populous
states; and the vast majority of medium-sized states.</p>

<p>Second, the current system does not reliably reflect the nationwide
popular vote. The statewide winner-take-all rule makes it possible for
a candidate to win the Presidency without winning the most popular
votes nationwide. This has occurred in one of every 14 presidential
elections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this is why I hold two opinions that the simpleminded might see as
contradictory:</p>

<ol>
<li>Given that the Electoral College exists, it would be right and
proper, not to mention legal, to use that system to keep a fascist,
racist rapist out of office.</li>
<li>The Electoral College is a bad system and should be replaced with a
national popular vote.</li>
</ol>

<p>There\&rsquo;s an interesting approach underway in an attempt to make this
happen without having to go the full route of a Constitutional
amendment: states are individually passing laws saying \&ldquo;our electors
pledge to follow the popular vote, but only as soon as enough other
states have also signed on.\&rdquo; (Game theory!)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/written-explanation">Agreement Among the States to Elect the President by National Popular
Vote</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The National Popular Vote bill would guarantee the Presidency to the
candidate who receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and the
District of Columbia.</p>

<p>The bill has been enacted by 11 jurisdictions possessing 165 electoral
votes -- 61% of the 270 electoral votes necessary to activate it.
[...]</p>

<p>Because of these state winner-take-all statutes, presidential
candidates have no reason to pay attention to the issues of concern to
voters in states where the statewide outcome is a foregone conclusion.
As shown on the map, two-thirds of the 2012 general-election campaign
events (176 of 253) were in just 4 states (Ohio, Florida, Virginia,
and Iowa). Thirty-eight states were ignored.</p>

<p>State winner-take-all statutes adversely affect governance.
\&ldquo;Battleground\&rdquo; states receive 7% more federal grants than
\&ldquo;spectator\&rdquo; states, twice as many presidential disaster
declarations, more Superfund enforcement exemptions, and more No Child
Left Behind law exemptions.</p>
</blockquote>

of Presidential Campaign Is in Just 6
States</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two-thirds (273 of 399) of the general-election campaign events in the
2016 presidential race were in just 6 states (Florida, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, and Michigan).</p>

<p>94% of the 2016 events (375 of the 399) were in 12 states (the 11
states identified earlier in the year as \&ldquo;battleground\&rdquo; states by
Politico and The Hill and Arizona. This fact validates the statement
by former presidential candidate and Governor Scott Walker of
Wisconsin on September 2, 2015, that \&rdquo;\&ldquo;The nation as a whole is not
going to elect the next president. Twelve states are.\&rdquo;</p>
