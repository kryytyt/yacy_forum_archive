shitting</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even more alarming was the bathroom culture. I can only speak to the
men\&rsquo;s room, most of which each had two urinals and two stalls. I come
from a background where a bathroom is a place where you do a certain
kind of business, in silence, and you leave. At Amazon, the men\&rsquo;s
room is an extension of the office. People chitchat about work in the
bathroom, as if it is just another meeting room where you can piss
everywhere.</p>
<p>The most horrifying moment of my employment at Amazon was the time I
was using the toilet and a coworker began talking from the stall next
to me. He asked me why I had not responded to his very pressing email.
I closed my eyes and pretended this wasn\&rsquo;t happening. What email
could be so important that it could not wait five minutes for me to
use the bathroom? He began tapping on the wall between our stalls,
asking why I wouldn\&rsquo;t respond, as if inter-stall conversation should
be a totally normal, not disgusting means of communication.</p>
<p>He became more specific about what he needed -- referencing a project
I\&rsquo;d never heard of, nor would I ever have involvement in -- and I
realized he had misidentified me from my shoes. (Many brown dress
shoes look alike, apparently.) We both exited our stalls around the
same time, and he realized his mistake. He didn\&rsquo;t apologize, only
explained that he thought I was someone else. As we washed our hands,
he just laughed, and I vowed I would never use the stalls on that
floor again.</p>
