<p><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/3007279563_37d3c47789_z.jpg" alt="" />I just watched
all nine <em>Hellraiser</em> movies. No, I didn\&rsquo;t know there were nine of them
either.</p>
<p>The decision-making process went something like this:</p>
<p>\&ldquo;There is some unfinished business in my <em>Lament</em> <a href="http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/">screen
saver</a>. I really ought to add the last
few moves to that.\&rdquo;<br />
\&rdquo;...Hmm, I guess I need to watch the movie again to make sure I got it
right.\&rdquo;<br />
\&rdquo;...Hmm, I wonder if any of the later movies added new cube
behaviors?\&rdquo;</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser">Hellraiser</a></strong></p>
<p>Wow, is this movie dated! It\&rsquo;s so 80s, with its giant shoulder pads
and nuclear family and unfamiliarity with guys in gimp suits with
lots of piercings. I remember this being a lot gorier and more
shocking than it seems now. Some of the practical effects hold up
reasonably well, but it\&rsquo;s really not that great a movie.</p>
<p>The cube goes through the four basic moves, plus there\&rsquo;s an
impossible shape during the scuffle at the end. It looks like they
broke two of the models and just glued them together randomly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser_2">Hellbound</a></strong></p>
<p>At the time, I remember thinking this wasn\&rsquo;t as good as the first
one, but now I think it\&rsquo;s a lot better. The Channard and Tiffany
characters are pretty interesting, and the whole Leviathan situation
is pretty cool. There\&rsquo;s really a lot more running and screaming
than there needed to be.</p>
<p>Two new cube behaviors: the opening door, and the transformation
into Leviathan. The Leviathan transformation annoys me because some
of the pieces of the cube just fade away in a jump cut, and it
doesn\&rsquo;t even remotely conserve mass. But they are in a hell
dimension at the time, so... ok. Also, they changed the orientation
of the faces. I assume that was an accident.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser_III:_Hell_on_Earth">Hell On
Earth</a></strong></p>
<p>This movie is absolutely terrible. They even made the \&ldquo;evil owner
of an evil nightclub\&rdquo; boring. (<em>The Crow</em> did that trope much
better.) They turned the Cenobites into low-rent late-period Freddy
Krugers. This one dimensional character is a cameraman, let\&rsquo;s stick
a camera in his head. This guy\&rsquo;s a DJ, he can shoot CDs out of his
mouth. Oh, and since we have a female lead, don\&rsquo;t skimp on the
daddy issues! Ugh. This is definitely the second worst of the entire
series.</p>
<p>One new cube behavior: a tower pops up and zap, zap, zaps Cenobites.
Also, instead of having six distinct faces, the cube only has three
faces that are duplicated. Come on, guys, can nobody keep track of
the original props?</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser:_Bloodline">Bloodline</a></strong></p>
<p>Overall, this movie is awful, but it has some good scenes. I really
enjoyed the fifteen minutes or so about Lemarchand creating the box,
and the Angelique character is kind of interesting, as a Cenobite
who predates the gimp-suit fashion trend taking over the hell
dimensions. The rest of it is crap: the 90s plot is crap, the
<em>Hellraiser In Space</em> plot is crap. I liked the idea of the office
building that was itself a Lament Configuration, though they didn\&rsquo;t
do much with that. Directed by Alan Smithee: probably his finest
work since <em>Dune</em>.</p>
<p>One new cube behavior: instead of the door opening as a square, it
opens as a pointy octagon. Nothing special.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser:_Inferno">Inferno</a></strong></p>
<p>This movie is not bad. But it\&rsquo;s only barely a Hellraiser movie.
It\&rsquo;s a noir-ish story about a dirty detective chasing a serial
killer who (dum dum dum) <em>might be himself</em>. The extremely small
amount of Hellraiser fu in it leads me to believe that the first
draft of this script wasn\&rsquo;t a Hellraiser movie at all, before they
re-tooled it.</p>
<p>No new box behaviors, since the box barely appears.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser:_Hellseeker">Hellseeker</a></strong></p>
<p>Oh, hey, Kirsty\&rsquo;s back! This one is pretty good. Probably the best
one so far. Kirsty\&rsquo;s jerk husband finds the box, hallucinates
wildly, and maybe murders a bunch of his friends. Nice twist at the
end.</p>
<p>One new box behavior, which might have been a dream: it starts out
as a sphere, and then turns into a cube. Whatever.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser:_Deader">Deader</a></strong></p>
<p>Deader? They actually called the movie <em>Deader?</em> This is another
script that pretty clearly started out its life as
not-a-Hellraiser-story, but I think it was pretty good. It\&rsquo;s kind
of <em>Flatliners Go Romania</em>. How do you run a nightclub in a subway
car? Note to self, look in to that.</p>
<p>One new cube behavior: when the chains come out, the whole top of
the box breaks open. Dumb.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser:_Hellworld">Hellworld</a></strong></p>
<p>This is one of the worst movies I\&rsquo;ve ever seen. This is some shitty
student film that they somehow got Lance Henriksen to be in. This
movie is so bad, I think I liked it better when it was called <em>House
of Wax</em> and starred Paris Hilton. There are a bunch of assholes who
play an online Hellraiser game and someone invites them to a party
and kills them all. There\&rsquo;s a reason but you will never care even
remotely what it is. Or whether any of them live.</p>
<p>One new cube behavior: nails come out of it. But it wasn\&rsquo;t a real
Lament Configuration so it doesn\&rsquo;t count.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser:_Revelations">Revelations</a></strong></p>
<p>Despite the reviews, I must say, I enjoyed this one! Maybe I was a
little punch-drunk by the time I made it this far, though. And
anything would be a step up from <em>Hellworld</em>. It starts off with
some shaky-cam nonsense, but fortunately they didn\&rsquo;t keep that up.
A couple of jerky bro teens go to Mexico, murder a hooker, and pick
up a Lament Configuration from some dude in a bar, you know, like
you do. Most of the movie is told as a flashback at a dinner party
with their jerky family, when one of them escapes from hell and
shows up skinless on the veranda. Antics ensue.</p>
<p>The box barely moves at all, but the glowing effects are much
better. Oh, and the guy who plays Pinhead is the worst. <em>The worst.</em></p></li>

<p>As soon as I posted it, it was immediately blocked with five or six
content-ID matches. So I filed a DMCA fair-use counter-claim, and
whattayaknow, it was back up less than a day later. I assumed they just
ignored those...</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Oh, I see that it says the counter-claim is still \&ldquo;being
examined\&ldquo;. So you\&rsquo;d better <a href="http://www.jwz.org/hacks/#youtubedown">download a copy of
it</a> in case they change their
mind.</p>
