Your Pet
Everywhere:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What a wonderful time it is for the scammer, the conniver, and the
cheat: [...] simply by claiming that the creatures are their
licensed companion animals and are necessary to their mental
well-being. No government agency keeps track of such figures, but in
2011 the National Service Animal Registry, a commercial enterprise
that sells certificates, vests, and badges for helper animals, signed
up twenty-four hundred emotional-support animals. Last year, it
registered eleven thousand. [...]</p>
<p>Contrary to what many business managers think, having an
emotional-support card merely means that one\&rsquo;s pet is registered in a
database of animals whose owners have paid anywhere from seventy to
two hundred dollars to one of several organizations, none of which are
recognized by the government. (You could register a Beanie Baby, as
long as you send a check.) Even with a card, it is against the law and
a violation of the city\&rsquo;s health code to take an animal into a
restaurant. Nor does an emotional-support card entitle you to bring
your pet into a hotel, store, taxi, train, or park.</p>
<p>No such restrictions apply to service dogs, which, like Secret Service
agents and Betty White, are allowed to go anywhere. In contrast to an
emotional-support animal (E.S.A.), a service dog is trained to perform
specific tasks, such as pulling a wheelchair and responding to
seizures. The I.R.S. classifies these dogs as a deductible medical
expense, whereas an emotional-support animal is more like a blankie.
[...]</p>
<p>Why didn\&rsquo;t anybody do the sensible thing, and tell me and my turtle
to get lost? The Americans with Disabilities Act allows you to ask
someone with a service animal only two questions: Is the animal
required because of a disability? What work or task has the animal
been trained to perform? Specific questions about a person\&rsquo;s
disability are off limits, and, as I mentioned, people are baffled by
the distinction between service animals and emotional-support animals.
[...]</p>
<p>Through a site called ESA Registration of America, I found a clinical
social worker in California who, at a cost of a hundred and forty
dollars, agreed to evaluate me over the phone to discuss the role of
Augustus, the snake, in my life. [...]</p>
<p>\&ldquo;How does Augustus help you with your problems?\&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Um, he provides unconditional love, and I feel safe when he\&rsquo;s
around,\&rdquo; I said. \&ldquo;He\&rsquo;s a good icebreaker, too, if I\&rsquo;m feeling
shy.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;You want to have more ease outside the house,\&rdquo; the therapist summed
up. \&ldquo;Now I want to do a generalized-anxiety screening with you,\&rdquo; she
said. \&ldquo;In the last fourteen days, have you felt anxious or on edge
nearly every day, more than seven days, or less than seven days?\&rdquo;
[...]</p>
<p>People with genuine impairments who depend on actual service animals
are infuriated by the sort of imposture I perpetrated with my phony
E.S.A.s. Nancy Lagasse suffers from multiple sclerosis and owns a
service dog that can do everything from turning lights on and off to
emptying her clothes dryer. \&ldquo;I\&rsquo;m shocked by the number of people who
go online and buy their pets vests meant for working dogs,\&rdquo; she told
me. \&ldquo;These dogs snarl and go after my dog. They set me up for
failure, because people then assume my dog is going to act up.\&rdquo;
[...]</p>
<p>Corey Hudson, the C.E.O. of Canine Companions for Independence, a
nonprofit provider of trained assistance animals, told me that he has
\&ldquo;declared war on fake assistance dogs.\&rdquo; Earlier this year, his
organization submitted a petition, which has now been signed by
twenty-eight thousand people, to the Department of Justice, requesting
that it consider setting up a registration -- \&ldquo;like the Department
of Motor Vehicles\&rdquo; -- to test and certify assistance dogs and to
regulate the sale of identification vests, badges, and so forth.
\&ldquo;They responded that they think the law is adequate.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*We have to deal with these entitled, lying shitheels at the club and
restaurant all the time. It is especially infuriating at the club,
because -- in my humble but correct opinion -- bringing a dog into a
nightclub is just straight-up animal abuse. That animal is going to go
<strong>deaf</strong>. So our staff strictly comply with the letter of the law --
and ensure that these people do as well. After their little snookums has
inevitably hopped up onto the bar, humped a stranger\&rsquo;s leg, or run
wild, this usually results in a 30 minute conversation ending with,
\&ldquo;You are welcome to sue us, or call the police, but right now, you have
to leave.\&rdquo; So far, they\&rsquo;ve been all bark and no bite.*</p>
