<p><a href="http://sf.streetsblog.org/2016/07/13/collecting-data-to-push-for-safer-biking-on-valencia/"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/img_20160712_184721-580x329.jpg" alt="" />50 cars
took turns blocking the bike lane on the west side of Valencia between
16th and 17th at the peak hour Tuesday
night.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>During yesterday evening\&rsquo;s rush hour, safe streets advocates [...]
started collecting hard data about how often the bike lanes on
Valencia Street are blocked by motorists. Take a wild guess what they
found: the bike lanes are a de facto loading-and-drop-off zone for
cars. [...]</p>

<p>Things picked up -- and got more dangerous -- as the evening
progressed. During the last hour, from 6-7 p.m. (Orland calls this the
\&ldquo;death trap\&rdquo; hour) 205 bikes had to swerve into traffic on that same
stretch of Valencia, thanks to 53 cars that blocked the bike lane --
remember, that\&rsquo;s just one block of Valencia, and just one side of the
street.</p>

<p>Although not officially counted, the volunteers reported most of the
cars had Uber or Lyft symbols on them. It should be noted that
Streetsblog observed several police cars passing by, and two cops
passing by on foot, but (no surprise) no citations were issued. That
said, some drivers of the illegally parked cars seemed wary of the
attention -- one BMW driver drove off, but not before gesturing
unkindly at Maureen Persico, a Bernal Heights resident and one of the
counters. [...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The West side of Valencia between 16th and 17th saw some of the most
flagrant disregard for safe operation of motor vehicles between 6
and 7pm. During the 6pm hour, on the West side of Valencia between
16th and 17th, motorists double parked at least once every two
minutes. Furthermore, according to the data we collected, over 61
percent of traffic in the 6 to 7pm hour is comprised of cyclists.
205 cyclists were forced to merge into the vehicle travel lane
during this hour, compromising their safety and forcing them to
squeeze into a narrow travel lane alongside faster moving vehicular
traffic. On multiple occasions, we observed cyclists taking evasive
action and being forced to quickly maneuver out of the bike lane to
avoid collisions with motorists who pulled over or pulled out
abruptly, without signaling. This compelling data paints a clear
picture of the threat to public safety posed by cars double parking
in bicycle lanes. I hope that city officials and SFPD will carefully
study this data and take action to ramp up enforcement -- and
prevent inevitable tragedy on this high injury corridor -- before
it is too late.</p>
