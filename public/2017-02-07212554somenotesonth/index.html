<p>Date: 2017-02-07 21:25:54</p>

<p><a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2017/02/some-notes-on-the-worst-case-s.html"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/148848_slide.jpg" alt="" /><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/trump_1.jpg" alt="" />We
are looking at an administration that is very clearly being operated on
behalf of carbon extraction
industries.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a huge asset bubble tied up in uncombustable fossil fuels --
the carbon bubble. In addition, there is a base of approximately
\$70Tn (\$70,000 billion--let that sink in for a moment) of installed
infrastructure for processing fossil fuels and petrochemicals [...]
It follows logically that if you have heavily invested in fossil
fuels, time is running out to realize a return on your investment.
Buying a US administration tailored to maximize ROI while fighting a
rear-guard action against action on climate change and roll-out of a
new, rival energy infrastructure is therefore rational (in business
terms). Russia and the Putin angle is best understood as part of this.
[...]</p>

<p>Note that climate change denialism is a flag of convenience for the
folks at the top. It\&rsquo;s a loyalty oath and a touchstone: they don\&rsquo;t
necessarily believe it, but it\&rsquo;s very convenient to fervently preach
it in public if you want to continue to turn a profit.</p>

<p>If you believe in anthropogenic climate change but dare not admit it,
you cannot be seen to do anything obvious to remediate it. But there
is one remediation tactic you can deploy deniably: genocide.</p>

<p>We are on course to hit 10 billion people by the end of the 21st
century, and although the second derivative of the curve of population
increase is flat, our peak population won\&rsquo;t begin to decline at this
rate until well into the 22nd century. [...]</p>

<p>While the gas chambers and extermination camps of the Final Solution
get the most attention, people tend to forget that a large chunk of
Hitler\&rsquo;s plan for conquest, Generalplan Ost, relied in the short term
on the Hunger Plan -- to kill 20-30 million people in Eastern Europe
and Russia by systematically stealing their food. [...]</p>

<p>But the Neo-Nazi International won\&rsquo;t need death camps in the 2020s to
2030s if their goal is to cut the world population by, say, 50%.
Climate change and a clampdown on international travel will do the job
for them. [...]</p>

<p>Never say Nazis don\&rsquo;t learn the lessons of history. This time round,
the Final Solution to Anthropogenic Climate change will be entirely
deniable! There are no gas chambers or Einsatzgruppen involved: any
bullets will be fired by autonomous robots, without a human finger on
the trigger, and will be an automatic reaction to an attempted border
crossing, so not the fault of the perpetrators. The victims will have
only themselves to blame, for being born in the wrong place, in the
wrong century, and for failing to adapt, and for starving themselves,
and for inviting the attention of the border patrol drones. It will be
a slow-motion atrocity on a scale that dwarfs the Holocaust. And it is
the logical conclusion of the policies our new fascist international
overlords appear to be working towards implementing.</p>
