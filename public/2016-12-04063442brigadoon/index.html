The Time
Machine</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brigadoon isn\&rsquo;t a love story -- I mean, it is, of course, because
it\&rsquo;s a musical, but it really shouldn\&rsquo;t be. It\&rsquo;s a horror movie, a
grotesquerie, a terrifying sci-fi cautionary tale with extraordinarily
threatening religious undertones. It shouldn\&rsquo;t be a lushly produced,
Vincente Minelli-directed Cinemascope tentpole with an iconic
Lerner-and-Loewe book and score (respectively), it should be a deeply
chilling, very special episode of the <em>Twilight Zone.</em> [...]</p>

<p>First: Effectively, the residents of Brigadoon are experiencing a
normal, continuous life, going to bed and then waking up, except that
when they wake up, it\&rsquo;s 100 years later than when they fell asleep.
Where the village goes when it disappears, and whether the residents
literally sleep for 100 years without aging or whether they in fact
are in a Brigadoon-effect bubble of time dilation and sleep for just
one night is unclear, but since the source of the village\&rsquo;s magic in
this world is actually, literally, Yaweh the Judeo-Christian god,
let\&rsquo;s just wave away the question and file it under \&ldquo;omnipotence,
idk.\&rdquo; Functionally, when you go to sleep in Brigadoon, you wake up a
century in the future.</p>

<p>Second: If the village was <del>cursed</del> blessed with its time-dilation
bubble 200 years ago, and it\&rsquo;s on a century cycle, that means that
this is only the second time ever that the village has reappeared.
More to the point, because the Brigadoonians experience time
continuously, it\&rsquo;s only two days later for them. The priest prayed
his magic wish-prayer and it was granted by apparently Loki-Yahweh or
someone and the entire town is trapped in a time-dilation bubble and
it\&rsquo;s ONLY BEEN TWO DAYS and they are all SHOCKINGLY CALM ABOUT THIS
which is ABSOLUTELY INSANE. [...]</p>

<p>More to the point, though, <em>how is this nightmare reality in which
they now live not the entire focus of the story?</em> [...] It seems to
me that a foundational allure of creating a world in which magic/weird
science/God-induced miracles exists would be sitting down and seeing
what the logical consequences are of your authorial tweak to the
fabric of reality. (For example, I am constantly annoyed whenever
characters in stories encounter ghosts or the spirits of dead people,
and don\&rsquo;t <em>immediately</em> reassess their metaphysical understanding of
reality, particularly their own corporeal forms, and also just
completely recalibrate their own fear of death. Wouldn\&rsquo;t you?)</p>

<p>But seriously. If you\&rsquo;re going to create a world where an entire town
of Puritanical eighteenth-century Scots(wo)men have their town
converted into a forward-motion-only time machine that will, in the
span of just one year in their eyes, deposit them in the year 38235
-- that\&rsquo;s <em>thirty-eight thousand two hundred thirty five</em> -- in
what frickin universe does it make any sense whatsoever to make your
story about a guy one of the village girls develops a crush on, on day
goddamn <em>two!?!</em></p>
