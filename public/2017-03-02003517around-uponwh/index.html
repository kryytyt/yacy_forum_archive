<p>Date: 2017-03-02 00:35:17</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/deleteuberphonescreenshot-488.jpg" alt="" />Maybe
you deleted the Uber app when they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/02/01/deleteuber-is-introducing-a-new-generation-to-the-horror-of-scabbing/">scabbed the deportation
protest</a>
in New York, then re-installed it the next day because convenience
outweighed your momentary dalliance with having principles. So here\&rsquo;s a
brief round-up of reasons why you should have stopped giving them your
money years ago.</p>

<p>I had hoped that I could just find someone else\&rsquo;s round-up of all the
reasons, but now I understand why I couldn\&rsquo;t: there are <em>so many</em> and
it\&rsquo;s <em>such a moving target</em>.</p>

<p>Let\&rsquo;s dive right in:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>2017: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/in-video-uber-ceo-argues-with-driver-over-falling-fares">Uber CEO Argues With Driver Over Falling Fares. Travis
Kalanick tells a driver to take responsibility for his problems and
boasts about a tough
culture:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;Bullshit. You know what? Some people don\&rsquo;t like to take
responsibility for their own shit. They blame everything in their
life on somebody else. Good luck!\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>Oh, but <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/uber-suffers-scandal-after-scandal-in-very-bad-stretch-171933284.html">he
fauxpologized:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the video quickly made the media rounds, Uber publicly
posted a short email Kalanick sent to all employees. Kalanick
apologized to the driver, and added, \&ldquo;I must fundamentally change
as a leader and grow up.\&rdquo; He also appeared to congratulate
himself for his apology: \&ldquo;This is the first time I\&rsquo;ve been
willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get
it.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>2017: <a href="http://www.recode.net/2017/2/20/14666572/uber-sexism-susan-fowler-delete-uber">Susan Fowler published an essay alleging that Uber\&rsquo;s human
resources representatives ignored multiple reports of sexual
harassment and sexism during her year-long stint at the
company:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fowler <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/2/19/14665076/ubers-travis-kalanick-susan-fowler-sexual-harassment-investigation">also
wrote</a>
that her manager threatened to fire her if she ever reported his
boss to HR again -- which is called retaliation and is illegal
according to equal employment laws. Fowler also wrote that she
made the company\&rsquo;s chief technology officer, Thuan Pham, aware
that her manager was threatening retaliation -- which he
acknowledged was illegal. However, nothing was done about it,
Fowler wrote.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>2017: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/24/uber-says-its-absolutely-not-behind-a-smear-campaign-against-ex-employee-susan-fowler-rigetti/">Uber says it\&rsquo;s \&lsquo;absolutely not\&rsquo; behind a smear campaign
against ex-employee Susan Fowler
Rigetti:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rigetti took to Twitter this morning to post that people were
being contacted for \&ldquo;personal and intimate info\&rdquo; about her,
causing many to conclude Uber was behind these actions.</p>

<p>It\&rsquo;s an easy assumption to make, given the company has said it
would be holding an independent investigation into the claims and
has used similar tactics before. In
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/nyregion/investigation-of-conservationist-conducted-on-ubers-behalf-crossed-the-line-judge-rules.html">2015</a>,
Uber hired a CIA-linked intelligence firm Ergo to look into the
background of a conservationist suing the company. It used the
same firm in
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/7/10/12127638/uber-ergo-investigation-lawsuit-fraud-travis-kalanick">2016</a>
to look into the backgrounds of the plaintiffs in a class-action
lawsuit against the company.</p>

<li><p>2017: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/technology/uber-workplace-culture.html">Inside Uber\&rsquo;s Aggressive, Unrestrained Workplace
Culture:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When new employees join Uber, they are asked to subscribe to 14
core company values, including making bold bets, being
\&ldquo;obsessed\&rdquo; with the customer, and \&ldquo;always be hustlin\&lsquo;.\&rdquo; The
ride-hailing service particularly emphasizes \&ldquo;meritocracy,\&rdquo; the
idea that the best and brightest will rise to the top based on
their efforts, even if it means stepping on toes to get there.
[...]</p>

<p>As chief executive, Mr. Kalanick has long set the tone for Uber.
[...] Mr. Kalanick, 40, has made pointed displays of ego: In a
GQ article in 2014, he referred to Uber as \&ldquo;Boob-er\&rdquo; because of
how the company helped him attract women.</p>

<p>That tone has been echoed in Uber\&rsquo;s workplace. At least two
former Uber workers said they had notified Thuan Pham, the
company\&rsquo;s chief technical officer, of workplace harassment at the
hands of managers and colleagues in 2016. One also emailed Mr.
Kalanick.</p>

<p>Uber also faces at least three lawsuits in at least two countries
from former employees alleging sexual harassment or verbal abuse
at the hands of managers, according to legal documents reviewed by
The Times. Other current and former employees said they were
considering legal action against the company.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>Oh yeah, that: <a href="http://www.gq.com/story/uber-cab-confessions">Uber Cab
Confessions:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the way he talks now -- which is large -- he\&rsquo;s surely
making up for lost time. When I tease him about his skyrocketing
desirability, he deflects with a wisecrack about women on demand:
Yeah, we call that Boob-er.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>2016: Uber\&rsquo;s process of background checks and accountability
remains top notch: <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/uber-drivers-accused-of-32-rapes-and-sex-attacks-on-london-passengers-a7037926.html">Uber drivers accused of 32 rapes and sex attacks
on London passengers over the past
year:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freedom of Information data obtained by The Sun newspaper revealed
32 assault claims were made against employees of the taxi-hailing
app in London over the past twelve months, equal to one every
eleven days. The figure represents more than a fifth of all claims
against taxi and car-hire drivers filed to 14 UK police forces
last year, which totalled at 154 allegations including attacks in
minicabs and chauffeur vehicles.</p>

assaults</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>2016: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/technology/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-trump-advisory-council.html">Uber collaborated with Trump, but only until they suffered
financially from that
decision:</a></p>

<p>\&ldquo;We\&rsquo;ll partner with anyone in the world as long they\&rsquo;re about
making transportation in cities better, creating job opportunities,
making it easier to get around, getting pollution out of the air and
traffic off the streets,\&rdquo; Kalanick told employees. [...]</p>

<p>Outside of the internal pressure, Uber faced other fallout from Mr.
Kalanick\&rsquo;s stance. More than 200,000 customers had deleted their
accounts.</p></li>

<li><p>2015: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/nyregion/investigation-of-conservationist-conducted-on-ubers-behalf-crossed-the-line-judge-rules.html">Thinking About Suing Uber? Let This Be a
Warning:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>After learning of Mr. Meyer\&rsquo;s background as a conservationist,
Ergo\&rsquo;s investigator, Miguel Santos-Neves, misrepresented himself
as he conducted interviews [...] All the \&ldquo;sources believe that
I am profiling Meyer for a report on leading figures in
conservation,\&rdquo; Mr. Santos-Neves said in a message to a superior.
[...]</p>

<p>\&ldquo;The court cannot help but be troubled by this whole dismal
incident,\&rdquo; the judge added, later noting that the secret
investigation had also delved into the background of Mr. Meyer\&rsquo;s
lawyer, Andrew Schmidt.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Uber and Mr. Kalanick declined to comment.</p>

<li><p>2016: <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/12/uber-is-now-literally-trying-to-murder-me/">Uber <em>illegally</em> launched self-driving cars on the streets of
SF, immediately running red lights and literally trying to murder
me.</a></p></li>

<li><p>2017: They claimed that the red-light-running was \&ldquo;human error\&ldquo;,
and that the cars were not in self-driving mode when that happened.
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/technology/anthony-levandowski-waymo-uber-google-lawsuit.html">They
lied.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>But even though Uber said it had suspended an employee riding in
the Volvo, the self-driving car was, in fact, driving itself when
it barreled through the red light, according to two Uber
employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they
signed nondisclosure agreements with the company, and internal
Uber documents viewed by The New York Times.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>2017: Oh gosh, that\&rsquo;s too bad: <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/googles-robocar-lawsuit-kill-ubers-future-send-execs-prison/">Google\&rsquo;s Robocar Lawsuit Could
Kill Uber\&rsquo;s Future and Send Execs to

<p>The lawsuit, which Waymo filed Thursday, alleges former Google
engineer Anthony Levandowski secretly downloaded 14,000
proprietary technical files before leaving [...] \&ldquo;From a
criminal perspective, I would be surprised if the FBI weren\&rsquo;t
looking into this.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>2014: <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/uber-executive-suggests-digging-up-dirt-on-journalists">A senior executive at Uber suggested that the company should
consider hiring a team of opposition researchers to dig up dirt on
its critics in the media -- and specifically to spread details of
the personal life of a female journalist who has criticized the
company:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over dinner, he outlined the notion of spending \&ldquo;a million
dollars\&rdquo; to hire four top opposition researchers and four
journalists. That team could, he said, help Uber fight back
against the press -- they\&rsquo;d look into \&ldquo;your personal lives,
your families,\&rdquo; and give the media a taste of its own medicine.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/enhanced-15222-1413917765-8.png" alt="" />
Michael was particularly focused on one journalist, Sarah Lacy,
the editor of the Silicon Valley website PandoDaily, a sometimes
combative voice inside the industry. Lacy recently accused Uber of
\&ldquo;sexism and misogyny.\&rdquo; <a href="http://pando.com/2014/10/22/the-horrific-trickle-down-of-asshole-culture-at-a-company-like-uber/">She

that she was deleting her Uber app after <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/french-uber-bird-hunting-promotion-pairs-lyon-riders-with-a">BuzzFeed News
reported</a>
that Uber appeared to be working with a French escort service. \&ldquo;I
don\&rsquo;t know how many more signals we need that the company simply
doesn\&rsquo;t respect us or prioritize our safety,\&rdquo; she wrote.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>Oh yeah, that: <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/french-uber-bird-hunting-promotion-pairs-lyon-riders-with-a">Sexist French Uber Promotion Pairs Riders With \&ldquo;Hot
Chick\&rdquo; Drivers. \&ldquo;Who said women don\&rsquo;t know how to drive?\&rdquo; the
Uber blog post
asks.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to a media backlash, the creepy promo never actually rolled
out. \&ldquo;They didn\&rsquo;t anticipate the reaction of Uber US,\&rdquo; said
Pierre Garonnaire, co-founder of Avions de Chasse, the escort
service that co-sponsored the idea.\&ldquo;In the US, you are more
Puritan. For me and most of the people of France, it was a good
[idea]. It was fun.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>2014: <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/08/you-stay-klassy-uber/">Lyft: \&ldquo;Uber scheduled, canceled 5,000 rides to hassle
us\&rdquo;:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>CNN reports that people associated with car-on-demand service Uber
have been attempting to sabotage an Uber competitor, Lyft, by
ordering and canceling as many as 5,000 rides since October 2013.
Lyft drivers have also complained that Uber employees will call
them to take \&ldquo;short, low-profit rides largely devoted to luring
them to work for Uber.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lyft claims to have sussed out the fake requests using phone
numbers used by \&ldquo;known Uber recruiters.\&rdquo; Lyft claims that one
Uber recruiter requested and canceled 300 rides from May 26 to
June 10, and it said that recruiter\&rsquo;s phone number was associated
with 21 more accounts with 1,524 canceled rides between them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My understanding is that using burner phones to DDoS your
competition is completely in line with Libertarian ideals.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a52689/how-to-really-delete-your-uber-account/">How To (Really) Delete Your Uber
Account.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>And, by the way...</p>

<p><a href="https://thebolditalic.com/if-youre-deleting-uber-you-might-as-well-delete-lyft-too-522115a5ed52">Lyft = Uber
Lite:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Uber gets a lot of negative press (and rightfully so) for the actions
it takes to reduce the pay of its drivers and to deny them basic
workers\&rsquo; rights. Yet Lyft often evades similar scrutiny. That
doesn\&rsquo;t mean it isn\&rsquo;t doing many of the exact same things. [...]</p>

<p>The idea that Lyft is a more compassionate or morally sound
ride-hailing company is false. It continues to place profitability and
ridership growth before fair wages and working conditions for its
drivers, using the same methods as Uber. Lyft simply escapes the same
level of scrutiny because its market share is so much smaller.
[...]</p>

<p>Finally, those who really want to challenge the morally bankrupt model
of Uber and Lyft, which denies drivers good benefits, reasonable
working conditions and fair pay in the name of profitability, should
instead be using public transit wherever possible and fighting to
improve it. In November 2016, nearly 70 percent of all public-transit
ballot measures were passed by voters, totalling more than \$170
billion in additional transit funding. And from a worker standpoint,
public-transit workers are generally salaried with benefits, and being
a public-transit worker is still a solid path to the middle class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/21/11275940/lyft-drivers-classify-employee-independent-contractor-uber">Lyft saved \$126 million by refusing to classify drivers as
employees:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to newly published court documents, Lyft would owe its
drivers \$126 million in reimbursement expenses for the last four
years if the ride-hail service classified them as employees rather
than independent contractors. The court documents provide a rare
glimpse into the huge amount of cash that companies like Lyft and Uber
save by refusing to classify its drivers as employees. [...]</p>

<p>Both Lyft and its much larger rival Uber face class action lawsuits
from drivers challenging their classification as independent
contractors. Lyft recently settled its lawsuit, agreeing to shell out
\$12.25 million in compensation to its drivers, while maintaining the
right to classify them as non-employees.</p>
