<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Functional programmers, realizing that their entire discipline is
rendered inconsistent and useless the instant it is faced with
herculean tasks such as \&ldquo;I/O\&rdquo; and \&ldquo;users\&ldquo;, finally admit for
the record that it\&rsquo;s better to do literally anything else when
these tasks arise. Satisfying termninology like \&lsquo;free monad\&rsquo; and
\&lsquo;applicative functors\&rsquo; are bandied about as Hackernews tries to
decide if you want imperative nougat with functional candy shell,
or functional fruit filling with a flaky imperative pastry
surrounding it. Nobody stops to wonder if the functional wizardry
compiles to imperative code, or whether the processor gives a shit
if your source code looks good in LaTeX. One Hackernews admits he
doesn\&rsquo;t know what these people are jabbering about; all users in
agreement are ritually downvoted. In accordance with federal law,
someone asks how this compares with Rust.</li>
<li>A spammer posts his bullshit, the 21st-century equivalent of
motivational speaking, only with fewer ticket sales and more ebook
download links. A Hackernews shark attack ensues as everyone
realizes it is finally on-topic to desperately plead for any
possible scrap of advice on how to actually make money. Not
discussed: how to start a startup without ruining anyone else\&rsquo;s
life.</li>
<li>A webshit, based on his hobby project, decides that the entire web
advertising market is a lie. He\&rsquo;s right, but for the wrong
reasons. Hackernews trades tips on convincing themselves their
entire industry isn\&rsquo;t a sack of bullshit.</li>
<li>People hired to look at terrible shit forty hours a week tend to
go crazy. Hackernews decides this must be why cops are all
assholes and that the solution is more cops. One Hackernews
suggests just hiring perverts.</li>
<li>The New York Times -- world\&rsquo;s leading authority on San Francisco
-- tells us that San Francisco is a microcosm of America.
Hackernews spends equal time telling each other how to donate
money toward fixing problems and telling each other that donating
money will not fix any problems. Nobody realizes Hackernews users
are the problem, including the New York Times.</li>
<li>A leisure studies major vomits a couple thousand words of
dime-store evolutionary psychology. Hackernews seizes on the
opportunity to delude themselves into believing that their
crippling anxiety and ever-increasing depression are what makes
them better than you.</li>
<li>Hackernews is concerned that stupid poor people might not realize
they are less alive if they choose to entertain themselves instead
of working ceaselessly unto death. The behavior of children is
held up by the childless as an example for us all. Some dipshit
thinks running his website is akin to preagricultural survival.
Dimly, a few Hackernews users experiment with the idea that money
and public acclaim are not the only route to happiness, but this
heresy is drowned out by the relentless insistance that being rich
is the only way to experience joy.</li>
<li>An idiot posts to Medium a rambling narrative regarding the
importance of his phone app. Hackernews maintains the only way to
be sure your shit is right is to host all of your own
communications tools. Google Analytics silently notes which
citizens have been contaminated with toxins inimical to
surveillance capitalism. The machine sleeps.</li>
</ul>
