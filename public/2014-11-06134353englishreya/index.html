<p>As promised, here is the relevant part of the email I had from Olimex (I
got it yesterday (5th November) in the morning):</p>

<blockquote>

\
Unfortunately, I don't see how Olimex can be of any help with the
issue you are facing. If the creators of the Yacy server are unable to
give instructions for installation under Debian 3.4.90+ then I would
suggest that the default images provided by Olimex are compiled as
armhf and Yacy seems to only work under armel distributions
(especially since you probably used armel distribution for the RPi
that ran Yacy successfully). Something more, since Yacy is written in
java the platform also needs to be suitable for hard-float -- there
are separate java distributions for soft-float and hard-float.\
\
Make sure you are using the proper java and the settings of yacy are
set properly. If there is no java installed nothing would happen.\
\
To be more specific why RPi uses armel and OLinuXino armhf
distributions -- there are hardware reasons for that -- the older
ARMv6 processors had no support for hard float point; while the
OLinuXino is ARMv7 and there is such support. The CPU in the Raspberry
Pi implements the ARMv6 ISA (with VFP2) and is thus incompatible with
the Debian armhf port baseline of ARMv7+VFP3 and ARM
hardware-floating-point ports for other distributions, which all have
the same baseline.\
\
The only ways out would be:\
\
1. Find a similar program that works under Debian 3.4.90+ and armhf
(hardware-floating) -- quite unlikely to find stable alternative to
Yacy\
\
2. Ask around the Yacy community to provide better armhf support\
\
3. Compile an OLinuXino image with soft-float\
\
The 3.15 kernel support you saw is incomplete and it is created by an
user. It is not an official release. The information might be found at
this blog post: [http://olimex.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/ \...
rnel-3-15/](http://olimex.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/a10-olinuxino-lime-open-source-hardware-linux-computer-now-in-kernel-3-15/){.postlink}
We are updating the kernel in the official releases when it reaches a
stable state. The progress for each kernel version might be found
here: <http://linux-sunxi.org/Linux_Kernel>\

Best regards,\
Lub/OLIMEX\

Subject: Support Question\
\
Hello,\
\
I write to you today about some issues I have with your boards. I
have, at the moment, three of your boards: iMX233-MINI, A13 and
A20-Lime2. I use the A13 as a server perfectly, and tried to use the
iMX233 as a Yacy server. I could not achieve it, since the server kept
on crashing before it even started. But this software run on a
raspberryPi, which has better hardware spec than iMX233. Hence I tried
to run Yacy on my A13, but it also failed. I then ordered a A20-Lime2
to get rid f the hardware specs uncertainty, but Yacy just crash the
same as on less powerful boards.\
\
I noticed that I could run Yacy on my laptop. Since my laptop has a
kernel 3.14 and the raspbian distribution has a 3.12 kernel (whiile
iMX233 is only 3.11) I wondered if it could be the cause.\
\
I opened a thread on the Yacy forums; it can be useful if you want
some more details.\
\
Do you think it possible to deliver a Debian image based on kernel
3.12 or higher for the Lime2? I saw that you did a 3.15 kernel based
image for A10-Lime, so I guess it would be possible (and easier, I am
not used to compile kernels) for you to deliver it.\

As I said before, I will not have much time to spend on this topic for a
few days at least, so for now I leave it the way it is. What I am
planning to do next:<br />
* try to install the softwares from jessie repositories if possible: I
noticed that Yacy would not run on a fresh install of Debian Wheezy on
anthoer laptop, but would once getting upgrades from jessie repos. It
did not throw the same error, but make a try will not hurt.<br />
* find or compile an Olinuxino image with armel instead of armhf.<br />
<br />
Once again, if I come to any relevant results, I shall let you know.</p>
