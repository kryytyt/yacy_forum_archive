<em>\&ldquo;What the fuck is up with this statue\&rsquo;s toes?\&rdquo;</em> and other questions
that you never get to know the answer to.

<p><a href="http://thetalkhouse.com/stranger-things-problem-plotblocking/">\&ldquo;Plotblocking\&rdquo; is a new word for describing what\&rsquo;s wrong with a lot
of television
writing.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Delay of audience gratification has been a staple of episodic
storytelling for a long time, but no show advanced the practice more
than the grandfather of plotblocking, Lost. No matter how well-written
the various flashbacks often were, the writers knew that what kept us
hooked was the mystery of the island -- and that storyline was
illiberally meted out like capfuls of water to a thirsty man. Just
enough to keep us alive. I\&rsquo;ve actually found that the shows that are
the most \&ldquo;binge-worthy\&rdquo; are the most narratively stingy. You start
each new episode almost out of frustration, hoping it will deliver a
morsel of satisfaction, an inch of forward progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That paragraph right there nails it. I find the rest of the article to
be kind of rambling, partly because I hated <em>Stranger Things</em>, but, that
right there.</p>
<p>(I hated <em>Stranger Things</em> because it is composed almost entirely of
things that I despise: 1: Steven Spielberg movies; 2: Stephen King
movies; 3: Nostalgia.)</p>
<p>A lot of my friends are freaking out about the season premiere of <em>The
Walking Dead</em>, and I feel their emotions are misdirected: rather than
feeling sad for the fate of characters they liked, they should feel
angry at the crass manipulativeness of the writers.</p>
<p>The \&ldquo;who died?\&rdquo; cliffhanger at the end of the last season was
forgivable. It\&rsquo;s just a cliffhanger. Those are a staple of season-based
television. It\&rsquo;s a cheap technique, and time-honored, while not in any
way honorable.</p>
<p>But the real manipulation came in the followup episode, where, for
almost the entire episode, the only people in the dark about what just
happened were <em>the audience.</em></p>
<p>If you are a writing a story and you hide from the audience facts that
are well known to all of the characters in the story, you are a hack.</p>
<p>If you are a writer and your viewpoint character is an omniscient
narrator, but you made that narrator be <em>more ignorant</em> than literally
every character actually participating in the plot, what the fuck is
that? That\&rsquo;s hack writing, that\&rsquo;s what the fuck that is. It\&rsquo;s cheap,
it\&rsquo;s cheating, you are bad at your job and you should feel bad.</p>
<p>Let me be clear: my anger about how bad that writing was is not based on
my love of the show. I don\&rsquo;t have any emotional investment in <em>The
Walking Dead</em>. I watch it, but I think it\&rsquo;s mediocre. It\&rsquo;s not bad,
but I just don\&rsquo;t care that much about any of the characters.</p>
<p>Though like I keep saying, <em>Fear The Walking Dead</em> seems to exist solely
to remind us of how much worse <em>The Walking Dead</em> could be: a good
metric for when you should stop watching a show is if you can\&rsquo;t think
of a single character where that character\&rsquo;s death would leave you with
any emotional impact besides, \&ldquo;Yay, I don\&rsquo;t have to hear their whining
any more, or be angry at their reflexive secrecy, at their <em>stultifying</em>
incuriosity, or at their stupid decisions that seemed to exist solely to
create bullshit plot problems for the writers to solve.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some people have accused <em>Mr. Robot</em> of plotblocking, but I don\&rsquo;t think
that\&rsquo;s really true. <em>Mr. Robot</em> is a show that is explicitly <em>about</em> an
unreliable narrator. Most of the reveals we get happen when Elliot
learns about them, or when Elliot\&rsquo;s various mental compartments allows
him to know them. Most of the time, he\&rsquo;s our viewpoint character and
his confusion and ignorance is ours. Or he\&rsquo;s directly and explicitly
lying to us in the second person.</p>
