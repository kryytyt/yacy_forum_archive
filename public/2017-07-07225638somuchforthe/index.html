Year in the Metabolist Future of
1972</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nakagin Capsule Tower was portrayed in the media as a sign of
\&lsquo;the capsule era\&lsquo;. With its avant-garde aesthetic it proposed a
mutant quality, offering the opportunity of adaptation over time.
Theoretically it increased the ability to configure the building to a
world accelerating towards a post-industrial society; the icon was
quickly labelled \&lsquo;the future of housing\&lsquo;. It was the tallest
building in the block. Visible from afar, with its sci-fi appearance,
the tower stood near the highway like a machine from the future.
[...]</p>

<p>The individual capsules don\&rsquo;t have hot water supply. For bathing, the
options are either to get a water heater on your own, or to use the
communal shower on the entrance floor. Most residents opt for the
second option. After the degradation of the pipes, a few years ago a
new network of pipelines was installed. The rotted pipes have led to
numerous leaks. Many of the capsules were thus unusable, rotting from
the inside. Moreover, the renovation works were done without much
care: doors were sawn into so as to pass and connect the new pipes. It
seems that with every repair, the building is falls further into
disrepair. [...]</p>

<p>Emergency exits were transformed into smoking rooms with ashtrays and
chairs. Up the stairs you will find clothes hanging on wires, shoe
cabinets, shelves with old and mouldy books, sets of boxes, huge
suitcases, bikes and even fences around the doors. The balcony on the
third floor, above the office level, is an abandoned platform. Dirty
water and rotten capsule remnants are its sole contents.</p>

<p>More than half of the capsules are abandoned and many are \&lsquo;sealed\&rsquo;
from the outside, due to the risks they present. Others, however, do
not even have locks and it is easy to enter and see the insides in
varying degrees of advanced decomposition: walls are coming off and
there is garbage, mould and moisture everywhere. From the emergency
stairs on the outside you can see that the capsules are slowly
rotting.</p>
