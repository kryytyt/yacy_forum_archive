<p>Hi David,<br />
<br />
what I can read out of your lines is not a problem of YaCy but a problem
of more supporters.<br />
As you can see on the commits here:
<a href="https://gitorious.org/yacy/rc1/commits/022c6d3ce1d7c872f837d9de99e3590220733f55">https://gitorious.org/yacy/rc1/commits/ ...
0220733f55</a>{.postlink}
there are just 2-3 main developers working on YaCy.<br />
Those may have a normal job and can\&rsquo;t work the whole day on this
project.<br />
What they can do, they do, when you have a look at the forum and the
wiki.<br />
To change this situation there exists 2 or more alternatives:<br />
1. Help YaCy through coding.<br />
(Download the Source, import the project into Eclipse, identify code
which you can optimize, optimize it and push it to the repository )<br />
2. Help by donating money.<br />
(So the core developer do not need to work so much and spend that time
on YaCy or pay developers)<br />
<br />
To the english section:<br />
YaCy is a decentralized search engine. So it would be good if this also
would work for the rest.<br />
Have a look at: <a href="https://twitter.com/yacy_search/status/423350478249160704">https://twitter.com/yacy_search/status/ ...
8249160704</a>{.postlink}<br />
There has been 1 guy I think who created an english forum you mentioned
but he stops working.<br />
Its no problem to setup a forum but mainly a legal problem to run
websites in several languages it costs a lot of time and money as you
can see
<a href="http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=4872">viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=4872</a>{.postlink-local}
in the last post.<br />
So the easiest way would be if everyone who wants a forum in his
language just setup a forum and this will be linked here -&gt; problem
solved.<br />
The main developers also could visit these forums to answer question as
if they were posted here.<br />
<br />
To the uptime:<br />
I dont think the uptime can be used for any statistics about the
stability.<br />
I have one local peer running which is offline when I shut down my
computer.<br />
I also have 1 remote peer running and I used it with 2 GB for 1 month
with crawler. After an update (which causes my peer to start running
from 0 again) I tried 600 MB for YaCy without a crawler just DHT and it
works for 3 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> days now and it keeps running.<br />
<br />
My conclusion:<br />
Continue to support the community by whether you suggest it to friends
or start contributing code (optimization) or you setup a forum or ...<br />
I for example recently found a bug in the RSS-Feed and never worked with
Gitorious and the last time I programed with Java was really years ago
... but I downloaded Eclipse and corrected the code and submitted it to
the repository to try it out. After some days it was checked and brought
into the actual release. I really would contribute more to YaCy but as
long as I do this in my spare time its not possible.<br />
I suggest you if you run into trouble with your YaCy peer fill in a bug
report or maybe start a thread in this forum.<br />
YaCy is the only Open Source Search Engine that I know at the moment
which also would work if you just have 1 Computer available and you
would live in a war-zone just like in Syria where maybe the Internet is
shut down at the borders.<br />
When I look at your post you really want the best for YaCy and this is
good because YaCy needs more people like you so thank you for your
support so far.<br />
<br />
PS: I really wonder why no state supports the idea behind YaCy.<br />
Imagine what yould be done with just 1 Million Euro/USD.<br />
Europe has no alternative to Google.<br />
Why is such a project not supported?<br />
We spend millions for bridges at highways where just 2 people or frogs
crosses the street in 1 whole year.<br />
But nevertheless the YaCy developers will continue their work on YaCy
and do what they can for it-</p>
