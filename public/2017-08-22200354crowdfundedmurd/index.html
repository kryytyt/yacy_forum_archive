<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/man-behind-crowdfunded-submarine-admits-that-missing-jo-1798150420"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/qirhqynpkwryhwxwlxhg.jpg" alt="" />Initially,
Madsen claimed he\&rsquo;d dropped Swedish journalist Kim Wall off before the
sinking and he didn\&rsquo;t know where she
was.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now police say Madsen has admitted that Wall died in an accident on
his sub and he \&ldquo;buried her at sea.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madsen was found on August 11th by the Danish Navy following a search
for the missing submarine. He initially claimed that he\&rsquo;d dropped
Wall off on the shore in Copenhagen Bay on August 10th. Her boyfriend
was the first to alert the police that the sub was missing. He told
authorities that Wall had left with Madsen in the vessel and had not
returned on time. He explained that she was writing a story about the
renaissance man for Wired magazine.</p>

board</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A headless female torso was found on Monday in the water\&rsquo;s edge in
Copenhagen, hours after a Danish inventor charged with killing a
journalist in his home-made submarine told a court she died on board,
police said.</p>

<p>Peter Madsen told the court that Swedish journalist Kim Wall had died
in an accident and he had buried her at sea, changing his earlier
statement the he dropped her off alive in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>Police later told a press conference that it was still too early to
identify the body - missing its head, legs and arms - that was found
by a passing cyclist.</p>
