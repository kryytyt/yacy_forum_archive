<a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/11/bubble-failure/">joke about Thiel\&rsquo;s \&ldquo;Brownshirt
Combinator\&rdquo;</a> isn\&rsquo;t
as funny now, is it?</p>
<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/12/transition-adviser-peter-thiel-would-directly-profit-from-mass-deportations/">Transition Adviser Peter Thiel Could Directly Profit From Mass
Deportations:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Palantir Technologies, the data-mining company co-founded by
billionaire and Trump transition adviser Peter Thiel, will likely
assist the Trump administration in its efforts to track and collect
intelligence on immigrants, according to a review of public records by
The Intercept. Since 2011, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement
agency\&rsquo;s Office of Homeland Security Investigations has paid Palantir
tens of millions of dollars to help construct and operate a complex
intelligence system called FALCON, which allows ICE to store, search,
and analyze troves of data that include family relationships,
employment information, immigration history, criminal records, and
home and work addresses. [...]</p>
<p>Working closely with a president-elect who has pledged to dramatically
expand ICE, Thiel\&rsquo;s varied connections to the immigration agency
place him in a position to potentially benefit financially from a
deportation campaign that carries highly personal stakes for millions
of Americans. [...]</p>
<p>In addition to containing information on family relationships and
immigration history, the records FALCON collects can also include
photographs of subjects, employment information, educational
background, and \&ldquo;geospatial data.\&rdquo; [...]</p>
<p>Last month, it was reported that Trump and his advisers are drafting
plans to launch a campaign of workplace raids across the country to
find undocumented immigrants. With a mandate to enforce laws relating
to unauthorized employment, HSI has been identified as the primary
component within ICE that conducts such job-site raids. This past
October, after a lengthy investigation, HSI agents raided several
Mexican restaurants in Buffalo, New York, arresting more than a dozen
workers, some of whom were charged with criminal counts of \&ldquo;illegal
re-entry,\&rdquo; raising an outcry from immigrant advocates. In 2013, after
an HSI raid on carwashes in Phoenix, more than two dozen immigrants
were reportedly sent to Enforcement and Removal Operations officers
for possible deportation.</p>
<p>ICE can conduct such raids even in so-called sanctuary cities that
have refused to allow local law enforcement to cooperate with ICE in
finding and removing undocumented immigrants. [...]</p>
<p>Palantir, which is backed by the CIA\&rsquo;s venture capital arm, did not
respond to a request for comment regarding its ICE contracts and
concerns over potential conflicts of interest. Peter Thiel
spokesperson Jeremiah Hall declined to comment on a list of emailed
queries, including a question asking whether Thiel has yet signed the
Trump transition ethics agreement.</p>

<p>Newly-released documents expose more explicitly the details of IBM\&rsquo;s
pivotal role in the Holocaust -- all six phases: identification,
expulsion from society, confiscation, ghettoization, deportation, and
even extermination. Moreover, the documents portray with crystal
clarity the personal involvement and micro-management of IBM president
Thomas J. Watson in the company\&rsquo;s co-planning and co-organizing of
Hitler\&rsquo;s campaign to destroy the Jews. [...]</p>
<p>Among the newly-released documents and archival materials are secret
1941 correspondence setting up the Dutch subsidiary of IBM to work in
tandem with the Nazis, company President Thomas Watson\&rsquo;s personal
approval for the 1939 release of special IBM alphabetizing machines to
help organize the rape of Poland and the deportation of Polish Jews,
as well as the IBM Concentration Camp Codes including IBM\&rsquo;s code for
death by Gas Chamber. Among the newly published photos of the punch
cards is the one developed for the statistician who reported directly
to Himmler and Eichmann. [...]</p>
<p>From the first moments of the Hitler regime in 1933, IBM used its
exclusive punch card technology and its global monopoly on information
technology to organize, systematize, and accelerate Hitler\&rsquo;s
anti-Jewish program, step by step facilitating the tightening noose.
The punch cards, machinery, training, servicing, and special project
work, such as population census and identification, was managed
directly by IBM headquarters in New York, and later through its
subsidiaries in Germany, known as Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen
Gesellschaft (DEHOMAG), Poland, Holland, France, Switzerland, and
other European countries. [...]</p>
<p>Particularly powerful are the newly-released copies of the IBM
concentration camp codes. IBM maintained a customer site, known as the
Hollerith Department, in virtually every concentration camp to sort or
process punch cards and track prisoners. The codes show IBM\&rsquo;s
numerical designation for various camps. Auschwitz was 001, Buchenwald
was 002; Dachau was 003, and so on. Various prisoner types were
reduced to IBM numbers, with 3 signifying homosexual, 9 for
anti-social, and 12 for Gypsy. The IBM number 8 designated a Jew.
Inmate death was also reduced to an IBM digit: 3 represented death by
natural causes, 4 by execution, 5 by suicide, and code 6 designated
\&ldquo;special treatment\&rdquo; in gas chambers. IBM engineers had to create
Hollerith codes to differentiate between a Jew who had been worked to
death and one who had been gassed, then print the cards, configure the
machines, train the staff, and continuously maintain the fragile
systems every two weeks on site in the concentration camps. [...]</p>
<p>At a time when the Watson name and the IBM image is being laundered by
whiz computers that can answer questions on TV game shows, it is
important to remember that Thomas Watson and his corporate behemoth
were guilty of genocide. The Treaty on Genocide, Article 2, defines
genocide as \&ldquo;acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in
part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group.\&rdquo; In Article
3, the treaty states that among the \&ldquo;acts [that] shall be
punishable,\&rdquo; are the ones in subsection (e), that is \&ldquo;complicity in
genocide.\&rdquo; As for who shall be punished, the Treaty specifies the
perpetrators in Article 4: \&ldquo;Persons committing genocide or any of the
other acts enumerated in Article 3 shall be punished, whether they are
constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials, or private
individuals.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>International Business Machines, and its president Thomas J. Watson,
committed genocide by any standard. It was never about the
antisemitism. It was never about the National Socialism. It was always
about the money. Business was their middle name.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/nitashatiku/facebook-trump-muslim-registry?utm_term=.qvGK6a5G1#.dxL59GnKw">Facebook Spokesperson Calls Muslim Registry \&ldquo;Straw
Man\&rdquo;:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A spokesperson for Facebook, accidentally responding to a BuzzFeed
News reporter via email, called the notion of a Muslim registry a
\&ldquo;straw man.\&rdquo; Seemingly thinking he was addressing a colleague, he
suggested that the best course of action was to not respond to the
reporter\&rsquo;s inquiry.</p>
<p>Earlier today BuzzFeed News emailed Facebook to ask whether the social
networking giant would make a commitment to limit data collection that
could be used for ethnic or religious targeting, including a pledge
not to build a registry of Muslims, if asked to do so by the
government. A Facebook public relations representative intended to
forward our request, along with a message about how to respond, within
Facebook, but accidentally sent the email to BuzzFeed News instead and
in doing so provided inadvertent insight into how the company plays
the optics game. [...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happy to talk to her off record about why this is attacking a straw
man. Also I heard back from her that she may or may not write an
additional piece depending on what response she gets from companies.
So sounds like not making any stmt on record is the way to go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The representative subsequently called, and asked that the email be
considered off the record. This preference for off-the-record spin
over on-the-record comments is fairly typical of large tech companies.
Facebook ultimately declined to comment. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;Facebook never would have taken the Lord\&rsquo;s name in vain had they
known the mic was live.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if you think that Facebook is not <em>already</em> a Muslim registry, you
have really not been paying attention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook, of course, already asks for and retains sensitive
information about the race, religion, and location of its users and
allows advertisers to target narrow segments of people based on that
personal information. Government officials here and abroad already use
the social network to track activists and dissidents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;We would never create a registry\&rdquo; sounds a little less convincing
when phrased as \&ldquo;we would <em>never</em> run that particular SQL query on our
existing database\&ldquo;, doesn\&rsquo;t it?</p>
