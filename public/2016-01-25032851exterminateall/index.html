<p><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/massive-attacks-new-app-generates-unique-remixes-based-on-your-environment">Fantom:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.thefantom.co/">The app, described as a \&ldquo;sensory music
player,\&rdquo;</a> provides us with four new Massive
Attack tracks. Each is a totally unique remix for every user, created
by an algorithm in the app that collates data from sensors in your
phone to create one-off remixes you can then record and share.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;Why would we put a premixed album out when there\&rsquo;s algorithms
that\&rsquo;ll mix this for you?\&rdquo;</p>

<p>The limitless potential of a project like this seems to fuel Del
Naja\&rsquo;s creativity. \&ldquo;I keep thinking about what we could do next; for
example, if you aggregated the personal data of everyone at a concert
who had the app then you might be able to remix the music we\&rsquo;re
playing in real-time,\&rdquo; he imagines. \&ldquo;So you could create a sort of
group sensory experience. It changes the way you think about
performance, because while one might see apps like this as an escapist
experience, it might be more pervasive. I think there\&rsquo;s potential for
it to affect the way we go out and how we share music with the people
around us.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>To create the experience, Thomas and Del Naja used studio masters of
the new Massive Attack tracks and broke them down into minimalist
fragments. In the app, these tracks evolve in accordance with personal
and environmental factors picked up from the user\&rsquo;s movement, camera
images, times of day and location -- as well as biometric signals
such as your heartbeat -- in the iPhone and Apple Watch. \&ldquo;I think
people understand now that devices can use a lot of our personal data
for useless stuff like targeted advertising,\&rdquo; says Thomas. \&ldquo;But what
we\&rsquo;re producing is almost the complete opposite of that. It takes
your data and creates a really great experience for you, without
storing it or trying to sell you something. It\&rsquo;s creation in the
moment and a logical avenue for artists to explore.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Thomas, it\&rsquo;s all about striking a balance between
\&ldquo;nonlinear\&rdquo; composition and the formality of conventional music. \&ldquo;I
think the mistake that people make when they think about this kind of
work is that it\&rsquo;s all randomly thrown together, but the way to make
this stuff well is to build rules into the system,\&rdquo; he says. \&ldquo;We
have to make sure it makes sense melodically: so a piece from the
chorus will never appear alongside a verse, which means the behavior
of the system can change, but it will always change in a musical
way.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>\&ldquo;We have to make sure it\&rsquo;s rewarding for the user and interesting
artistically, never working against the musical intentions of the
material.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thomas is cautious about how the musical interaction with the user
happens. \&ldquo;It\&rsquo;s very curatorial\&rdquo; he tells me. \&ldquo;We have to make sure
it\&rsquo;s rewarding for the user and interesting artistically, never
working against the musical intentions of the material. But in the
future we\&rsquo;re looking towards AI taking over some aspects of that
curation, so it would be possible for a meta-reworking, where multiple
remixes are possible.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This thing is really cool. Also
