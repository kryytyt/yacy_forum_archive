<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/malware-dna-hack/">Malware in a Strand of
DNA</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A group of researchers from the University of Washington has shown for
the first time that it\&rsquo;s possible to encode malicious software into
physical strands of DNA, so that when a gene sequencer analyzes it the
resulting data becomes a program that corrupts gene-sequencing
software and takes control of the underlying computer. [...]</p>

<p>But encoding [the buffer overflow attack] in actual DNA proved
harder than they first imagined. DNA sequencers work by mixing DNA
with chemicals that bind differently to DNA\&rsquo;s basic units of code --
the chemical bases A, T, G, and C -- and each emit a different color
of light, captured in a photo of the DNA molecules. To speed up the
processing, the images of millions of bases are split up into
thousands of chunks and analyzed in parallel. So all the data that
comprised their attack had to fit into just a few hundred of those
bases, to increase the likelihood it would remain intact throughout
the sequencer\&rsquo;s parallel processing.</p>
<p>When the researchers sent their carefully crafted attack to the DNA
synthesis service Integrated DNA Technologies in the form of As, Ts,
Gs, and Cs, they found that DNA has other physical restrictions too.
For their DNA sample to remain stable, they had to maintain a certain
ratio of Gs and Cs to As and Ts, because the natural stability of DNA
depends on a regular proportion of A-T and G-C pairs. And while a
buffer overflow often involves using the same strings of data
repeatedly, doing so in this case caused the DNA strand to fold in on
itself. All of that meant the group had to repeatedly rewrite their
exploit code to find a form that could also survive as actual DNA,
which the synthesis service would ultimately send them in a
finger-sized plastic vial in the mail.</p>
<p>The result, finally, was a piece of attack software that could survive
the translation from physical DNA to the digital format, known as
FASTQ, that\&rsquo;s used to store the DNA sequence. And when that FASTQ
file is compressed with a common compression program known as fqzcomp
-- FASTQ files are often compressed because they can stretch to
gigabytes of text -- it hacks that compression software with its
buffer overflow exploit, breaking out of the program and into the
memory of the computer running the software to run its own arbitrary
commands.</p>
<p>Even then, the attack was fully translated only about 37 percent of
the time, since the sequencer\&rsquo;s parallel processing often cut it
short or -- another hazard of writing code in a physical object --
the program decoded it backward. (A strand of DNA can be sequenced in
either direction, but code is meant to be read in only one. The
researchers suggest in their paper that future, improved versions of
the attack might be crafted as a palindrome.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This next part makes me sad. By \&ldquo;verge on cheating\&rdquo; you mean
\&ldquo;absolutely totally cheating\&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite that tortuous, unreliable process, the researchers admit, they
also had to take some serious shortcuts in their proof-of-concept that
verge on cheating. Rather than exploit an existing vulnerability in
the fqzcomp program, as real-world hackers do, they modified the
program\&rsquo;s open-source code to insert their own flaw allowing the
buffer overflow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, it\&rsquo;s a great stunt. <a href="http://dnasec.cs.washington.edu/dnasec.pdf">Original paper
