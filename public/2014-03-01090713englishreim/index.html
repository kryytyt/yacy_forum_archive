Hi, thats a very interesting proposal!\
\
Thats a very useful use of YaCy as a \'laboratory\' for \'social
search\' & ranking research. Since that approach will come up with a
set of ranking rules for YaCy, it will be very useful for us.\
\
This reminds me that the documentation for the YaCy ranking mechanism
is (still) very incomplete, so please use the opportunity to ask
questions about it, I will do my best to write a documentation in the
wiki to answer your questions.\
\
I would like to add another reference for this idea: the french seeks
project, now moved to <https://github.com/beniz/seeks>\
Short about seeks: its a framework above of other search engines which
applies \'social ranking rules\' using the clicks on search results.
They claim that they solved the problem to anonymously distribute the
clicks on the results to main privacy of the users. I got this
explained by the project maintainer, Emmanuel Benazera, in personal
discussion, and it made pretty much sense. I hope there is some
documentation visible about his approach, if you cannot find that then
just ask him\...\
\
I would like to mention that we actually have an upvote/downvote
mechanism at the search results which is not very much used; just a
hint that there is already some framework that you could use. Please
consider that you may get your hands on the code for that
![;)](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif "Wink")\
\
However, if you need something, just post here.\

Hi Orbiter,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
I have one question about the ranking. I see there are two ranking
mechanisms, SOLR and RWI. The documentation states that some items in
the index only have RWI data available, but it\&rsquo;s not clear to me what
circumstances that occurs under. Is that just because some network nodes
are on old YaCy versions that don\&rsquo;t use SOLR internally? Or is there
some other circumstance under which a search result will only have RWI
data?<br />
<br />
Regarding Seeks, there are a few reasons why I chose not to include it
in my proposal (I\&rsquo;m familiar with it). It doesn\&rsquo;t seem to be actively
maintained and installation on current OS versions is extremely
difficult (or at least completely undocumented). To my knowledge Seeks
doesn\&rsquo;t run on Windows, which limits its audience considerably. My best
understanding of Seeks\&rsquo;s privacy features is that it only shares your
data with people who make similar searches based on a locality-sensitive
hash function; this makes it hard to evaluate a search algorithm on a
wide variety of searches. (I could be wrong here, as the documentation
is extremely weak on this.) And I\&rsquo;m unaware of any anti-Sybil
algorithms used by Seeks, which would make it somewhat vulnerable to
spamming. (Again, maybe I\&rsquo;m wrong, as the documentation is very weak.)<br />
<br />
I noticed that there are \&ldquo;bookmark\&ldquo;/\&ldquo;recommend\&ldquo;/\&ldquo;delete\&rdquo; icons
next to each search result; is this the upvote/downvote mechanism
you\&rsquo;re talking about or is there something else I\&rsquo;ve missed? I
haven\&rsquo;t found any documentation on what those three icons currently do,
is there documentation available for them that I\&rsquo;ve missed?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>
