<p>Date: 2014-12-30 14:11:00</p>
<p>Hello.<br />
Please we are setting up a private group of new YaCy servers which will
be in full P2P with DHT. We need your \&rsquo; seasoned \&rsquo; advice, please.
Thanks.<br />
<br />
1. We need the [[Current Best Practices
Instructions]{style=&ldquo;text-decoration: underline&rdquo;}]{style=&ldquo;font-weight: bold&rdquo;}
on prefered configuration for this new group of cloud servers, starting
with 3 new servers that are \&rsquo; UP \&rsquo; and functioning now in stand alone
Robinson mode.<br />
We will continue to add more servers to the private group.<br />
The servers in the new group are currently identical to each other.<br />
The servers can currently read each other\&rsquo;s Solr files, but they cannot
write to each other.<br />
This means the the new cloud servers were set up, one by one, in
Robinson mode with cross reading privileges between servers.<br />
Now they need to be changed to the fully shared and standard YaCy
environment for private groups of servers working together.<br />
We wish these to be in the full DHT P2P mode as a private network.<br />
<br />
We appreciate this requires more space and we have cloud computing and
storage capacity assigned for this - in and across the clouds.<br />
<br />
+<br />
2. We have 2 prior Robinson servers that need to be migrated to this new
group, described above.<br />
They each have somewhat less than 20 GB of DATA Sets, each.<br />
This data must be retained and moved to the new P2P DHT environment
safely.<br />
<br />
We understand that the function of the environment is such that as this
data is migrated, duplicates will be eliminated as part of the standard
indexing process.<br />
Is this correct?<br />
<br />
How do we safely change their Robinson configurations to become part of
the new private DHT P2P group.<br />
Essential is that they not lose the data they have collected and
indexed.<br />
<br />
3. As noted: Our ultimate goal is to migrate the data the earlier two
Robinson servers have independently collected and move it to the pool of
data among the others - in the framework of the new collective,
described above.<br />
The result is that there will no longer be any Robinson servers (-0-).<br />
All servers will be in a secured private P2P group with DHT.<br />
All 5 servers (initially) will become part of the private pool of
servers in full P2P with DHT - but as a stand alone private network of
cloud servers with appropriate security features protecting it from the
outside.<br />
<br />
The environment will be fed data, and read by standard approaches to a
YaCy server. We are assuming that this distributed computational
environment will create a kind of load sharing for crawling and search
results generation.<br />
Traffic is still light.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your careful, precise and detailed instructions and
guidance. No detail is too small, please. [[Please Assume that we do not
know what may seem obvious to
you]{style=&ldquo;text-decoration: underline&rdquo;}]{style=&ldquo;font-style: italic&rdquo;}.
Thanks for your patience!

PMs are very OK, too. Many Thanks, once again!</p>
