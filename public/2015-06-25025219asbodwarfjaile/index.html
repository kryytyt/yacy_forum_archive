<p>Date: 2015-06-25 02:52:19</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/11692974/Asbo-dwarf-jailed-after-impersonating-a-Dalek-and-threatening-woman-with-a-butterknife.html"><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/ian_salter_bromley_3350419k.jpg" alt="" />Ian
Salter-Bromley, 55, stuck a sucker dart on his forehead and filled his
mouth with dominoes before shouting: \&lsquo;Exterminate!
Exterminate!\&rsquo;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>He returned to his flat and barricaded the door after they called the
police and he was involved in a stand-off before he had to be Tasered
twice, with police worried they would hit his colostomy bag.</p>

<p>The offence was committed during a campaign of public abuse after he
defecated in a council office in protest his kitchen work tops had
been mounted 8in too high for him to reach. Salter-Bromley exposed
himself and spread excrement and urine in Hull\&rsquo;s Wilson centre in the
main reception and toilets and he was given an Asbo for a string of
nuisance calls to emergency services.</p>

<p>Salter Bromley appeared for sentence at Hull Crown Court after
admitting a charge of affray for threatening police in the Dalek
stunt, possession of a knife in a public place and breach of his Asbo
for threatening a woman on a bus with a bread knife when he thought
children were making fun of his dwarfism. [...] Mr Brook said Mr
Salter Bromley had to be sentenced for a disturbance on board a bus on
September 9 when he produced the knife and began waving it about
before telling one woman that \&ldquo;if he was going down for killing
someone, she was going down with him\&ldquo;. [...]</p>

<p>Defence barrister Paul Genney said the offences sounded worse than
they were as his client was a lonely man with few friends who recently
had his wheelchair stolen. [...]</p>

<p>\&ldquo;He said in the bus incident the woman admitted she had not felt
threatened. The knife was only a butter knife, which was blunt and
only slightly serrated,\&rdquo; he said. \&ldquo;His physical state is poor. He
once tried to kill himself and broke his back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>This man is a hero.</em></p>
