<h1 id="english-re-yacy-version-1-81-9116-knocks-servers-off-adressing">English â€¢ Re: YaCy version 1.<sup>81</sup>&frasl;<sub>9116</sub> knocks servers off Adressing</h1>
<p>Date: 2014-10-31 12:07:01</p>
<p>Thank you for your thoughtful and helpful comments and suggestions.<br />
We have updated the ticket at
<a href="http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=492#bugnotes">http://mantis.tokeek.de/view.php?id=492#bugnotes</a><br />
<br />
Summary;<br />
We have upgraded both servers to today\&rsquo;s available ver 1.<sup>81</sup>&frasl;<sub>9130</sub><br />
While both are apparently stable,<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; No change in observed systems behavior.<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;NO SEARCH RESULTS DISPLAY when searches are made. Only the page
header details including the search button, when using a template
provided with the kit.<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; errors of 500 type lists are still showing, as detailed
previously, in administration pages<br />
This condition persists despite that we have applied -2- updates since
the incident began on both servers, as a result of applying ( 1.<sup>81</sup>&frasl;<sub>9116</sub>
), sequentially to each cloud in the scope of ~10 min.<br />
<br />
Good idea...we know the clicking back trick and have tried it, but it
doesn\&rsquo;t give us any joy, unfortunately. But thanks!<br />
<br />
The some 700+ mostly custom RSS crawls are divided between the presently
two servers.<br />
This would tend to indicate a somewhat lower loading than you suggest,
however, due to some things, among which the loading in \&ldquo;rush hours,\&rdquo;
it can become heavy and at those times, the engines are visibly running
very quickly - depending upon the remote sources being addressed.<br />
While the crawls are typically once ( 1X ) a day, there are some
important characteristics which define system loading.<br />
Each RSS can include a long secondary list of hundreds of external
addresses of URLs that have been pre-retrieved by another toolset, and
then those results must be crawled and locally indexed. The list of each
one can be over 1000 entries long, upon occasion ( i.e., frequently ).<br />
There are also time of day issues. Typically evening and late night
until very early morning (in the night) are especially busy times due to
the availability of \&ldquo;fresh data\&rdquo; to harvest. Then a few hours later in
the mornings, for another large but shorter block of high traffic
times.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your thoughts. I will pm.<br />
Our #1 issue now is to remove the persistent condition where the The
Key Error Message still displayed is:<br />
<br />
on page: / Status.html?noforward=<br />
\&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
\
The peer must go online to get a peer address.\
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>\&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Note: These was never in peer mode. These are stand alone Robinson
Servers that read each other to fulfill search requests, but do not
write to each other.<br />
<br />
Both servers were knocked offline, disconnected by the version update
applied, at the start of this ticket ( 1.<sup>81</sup>&frasl;<sub>9116</sub> ). They were NOT
Reconnected by the -2- two subsequent updates we have applied since our
first report.<br />
Therefore it appears a manual re-connection is needed. What &amp; Where and
what is the correct Syntax are the questions to answer, please. We
suspect that restoring this manually may have a beneficent effect on the
whole environment in each cloud, but it is only a theory.<br />
Thank You Very, Very Kindly, Everybody...</p>
