<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/tedchiang/the-real-danger-to-civilization-isnt-ai-its-runaway?utm_term=.brwPyvVj3#.urLj8eWxV">Ted Chiang: \&ldquo;When Silicon Valley tries to imagine superintelligence,
what it comes up with is no-holds-barred
capitalism.\&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Insight is precisely what Musk\&rsquo;s strawberry-picking AI lacks, as do
all the other AIs that destroy humanity in similar doomsday scenarios.
I used to find it odd that these hypothetical AIs were supposed to be
smart enough to solve problems that no human could, yet they were
incapable of doing something most every adult has done: taking a step
back and asking whether their current course of action is really a
good idea. Then I realized that we are already surrounded by machines
that demonstrate a complete lack of insight, we just call them
corporations. Corporations don\&rsquo;t operate autonomously, of course, and
the humans in charge of them are presumably capable of insight, but
capitalism doesn\&rsquo;t reward them for using it. On the contrary,
capitalism actively erodes this capacity in people by demanding that
they replace their own judgment of what \&ldquo;good\&rdquo; means with \&ldquo;whatever
the market decides.\&rdquo; [...]</p>

<p>There are industry observers talking about the need for AIs to have a
sense of ethics, and some have proposed that we ensure that any
superintelligent AIs we create be \&ldquo;friendly,\&rdquo; meaning that their
goals are aligned with human goals. I find these suggestions ironic
given that we as a society have failed to teach corporations a sense
of ethics, that we did nothing to ensure that Facebook\&rsquo;s and
Amazon\&rsquo;s goals were aligned with the public good. But I shouldn\&rsquo;t be
surprised; the question of how to create friendly AI is simply more
fun to think about than the problem of industry regulation, just as
imagining what you\&rsquo;d do during the zombie apocalypse is more fun than
thinking about how to mitigate global warming. [...]</p>

<p>There\&rsquo;s a saying, popularized by Fredric Jameson, that it\&rsquo;s easier
to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism.
It\&rsquo;s no surprise that Silicon Valley capitalists don\&rsquo;t want to think
about capitalism ending. What\&rsquo;s unexpected is that the way they
envision the world ending is through a form of unchecked capitalism,
disguised as a superintelligent AI. They have unconsciously created a
devil in their own image, a boogeyman whose excesses are precisely
their own.</p>
