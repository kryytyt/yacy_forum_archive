<p>Date: 2017-09-06 20:37:18</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/nation-suddenly-realizes-this-just-going-to-be-a-t-30195"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/1208.jpg" alt="" />From 2012. I liked The Onion
more back when it was
fiction.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>NEW YORK -- Following Hurricane Sandy\&rsquo;s destructive tear through the
Northeast this week, the nation\&rsquo;s 300 million citizens looked upon
the trail of devastation and fully realized, for the first time, that
this is just going to be something that happens from now on.</p>

<p>Gradually comprehending that this sort of thing is now just a fact of
life, citizens all across America stared blankly at images of
destroyed homes, major cities paralyzed by flooding, and ravaged
communities covered in debris, and finally acknowledged that this,
apparently, is now a regular part of the human experience.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;Oh, I see -- this is just going to be how it is from here on out,\&rdquo;
said New York City resident Brian Marcello, coming to terms with the
fact that an immense storm that cripples mass transit systems and
knocks out power for millions in the nation\&rsquo;s largest metropolitan
area can no longer be regarded as an isolated, freak incident, and
will henceforth be just a normal thing that happens. \&ldquo;Hugely
destructive weather events are going to keep happening, and they are
going to get worse and worse, and living through them is something
that will be a part of all our lives from now on, whether we like it
or not.\&rdquo; [...]</p>

<p>A Reuters poll conducted earlier this week found that 43 percent of
Americans reported finally accepting the fact that a potentially
endless number of increasingly lethal natural disasters would likely
occur throughout the coming decades, while as many as 18 percent of
respondents said they were \&ldquo;almost relieved\&rdquo; knowing that the
possibility of their entire life being washed away in an instant now
existed. [...]</p>

<p>\&ldquo;I went through something very similar a few years ago when I finally
came to terms with the fact that no one would ever listen to anything
I said about global warming,\&rdquo; Morales added. \&ldquo;And that it is
entirely too late to do anything about it.\&rdquo;</p>
