<p>Date: 2016-09-01 00:51:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/28/tim-berners-lee-open-web-mark-zuckerberg-facebook"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/giphy-4.gif" alt="" />It\&rsquo;s hypocritical of Mark
Zuckerberg to sing the praises of the web\&rsquo;s founder when he\&rsquo;s trying
to monopolise the
internet</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I f there were a Nobel prize for hypocrisy, then its first recipient
ought to be Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook boss. On 23 August, all his
1.7 billion users were greeted by this message: \&ldquo;Celebrating 25 years
of connecting people. The web opened up to the world 25 years ago
today! We thank Sir Tim Berners-Lee and other internet pioneers for
making the world more open and connected.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aw, isn\&rsquo;t that nice? From one \&ldquo;pioneer\&rdquo; to another. What a pity,
then, that it is a combination of bullshit and hypocrisy. [...]</p>
<p>It\&rsquo;s not the inaccuracy that grates, however, but the hypocrisy.
Zuckerberg thanks Berners-Lee for \&ldquo;making the world more open and
connected\&ldquo;. So do I. What Zuck conveniently omits to mention, though,
is that he is embarked upon a commercial project whose sole aim is to
make the world more \&ldquo;connected\&rdquo; but less open. Facebook is what we
used to call a \&ldquo;walled garden\&rdquo; and now call a silo: a controlled
space in which people are allowed to do things that will amuse them
while enabling Facebook to monetise their data trails. One network to
rule them all. If you wanted a vision of the opposite of the open web,
then Facebook is it.</p>
<p>The thing that makes the web distinctive is also what made the
internet special, namely that it was designed as an open platform. It
was designed to facilitate \&ldquo;permissionless innovation\&ldquo;. If you had a
good idea that could be realised using data packets, and possessed the
programming skills to write the necessary software, then the internet
-- and the web -- would do it for you, no questions asked. And you
didn\&rsquo;t need much in the way of financial resources -- or to ask
anyone for permission -- in order to realise your dream.</p>
<p>An open platform is one on which anyone can build whatever they like.
It\&rsquo;s what enabled a young Harvard sophomore, name of Zuckerberg, to
take an idea lifted from two nice-but-dim oarsmen, translate it into
computer code and launch it on an unsuspecting world. And in the
process create an empire of 1.7 billion subjects with apparently
limitless revenues. That\&rsquo;s what permissionless innovation is like.</p>
<p>The open web enabled Zuckerberg to do this. But -- guess what? --
the Facebook founder has no intention of allowing anyone to build
anything on his platform that does not have his express approval.
Having profited mightily from the openness of the web, in other words,
he has kicked away the ladder that elevated him to his current
eminence. And the whole thrust of his company\&rsquo;s strategy is to
persuade billions of future users that Facebook is the only bit of the
internet they really need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like I <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/10/if-you-work-for-facebook-quit/">keep
saying:</a></p>
<p>If you work for Facebook, quit. It is morally indefensible for you to
use your skills to make that company more powerful. By working there,
you are making the world an objectively worse place. I\&rsquo;m sure you can
find a job working for a company that you don\&rsquo;t have to <em>apologize</em> for
all the time.</p>
<p>You can <em>do it.</em> I <em>believe</em> in you.</p>
