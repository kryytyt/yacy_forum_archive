<h1 id="the-killing-joke-is-just-as-bad-as-you-ve-heard">The Killing Joke is just as bad as you\&rsquo;ve heard</h1>

<p>Date: 2016-08-03 10:15:11</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/riaab71w268si1u5udbr.png" alt="" />What a piece of
shit.</p>

<p>When I heard they were adding a larger Batgirl plot to this story, I
thought, \&ldquo;Oh good, they\&rsquo;re going to make her more than the awful prop
she was in the comic.\&rdquo; Nope, they went in completely the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>Spoiler, because I want to spoil it for you so that you won\&rsquo;t see it:
the first 30 minutes is Batgirl pining after Batman, swooning about him
to her Gay Best Friend from Central Casting (yes, really). And then she
fucks Batman. And he won\&rsquo;t return her calls, so she quits being
Batgirl.</p>

<p>It was as bad as you\&rsquo;d expect, having read about <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/07/23/using-sex-and-pining-for-bruce-the-killing-joke-qa-from-the-san-diego-screening/">this lovely
exchange</a>
at Comicon:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The very last question posed to the panel addressed this. The question
was asked by a person cosplaying as the Joker: Batgirl, Barbara Gordon
is such a strong female character. Why was this more about the males
in her life? The crowd applauded the question.</p>

<p>As they fumbled with the question,saying they do feel like she is
portrayed as a very strong female character, I lost control of my
emotions and, invigorated by someone asking the question I wanted to
hear, I shouted from the audience with frustrated sarcasm,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;Yeah, by using sex and then pining for Bruce.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The panel understandably asked what was that. I repeated myself, but
the crowd was both booing and clapping at what was said. Clearly they
had heard me the second time, because instead of responding the second
time it was said, Azzarello yelled from the stage</p>

<blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;Wanna say that again? Pussy?\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So that\&rsquo;s Brian Azzarello removing any doubt that not only did he write
a terrible story, but that he\&rsquo;s also human garbage.</p>

<p>Mark Hamill\&rsquo;s voice is perfect -- he will always be the One True Joker
to me -- but he can\&rsquo;t save this movie.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Killing_Joke#Creator.27s_response">Alan
Moore</a>
on the decision to <a href="http://lby3.com/wir/">stuff Barbara in the fridge</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a 2006 interview with Wizard magazine, Moore was also critical
about his decision to cripple Barbara Gordon: \&ldquo;I asked DC if they had
any problem with me crippling Barbara Gordon - who was Batgirl at the
time - and if I remember, I spoke to Len Wein, who was our editor on
the project ... [He] said, \&lsquo;Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch.\&rsquo; It
was probably one of the areas where they should\&rsquo;ve reined me in, but
they didn\&rsquo;t.\&rdquo;</p>
