<p><a href="https://torontodreamsproject.blogspot.de/2012/08/the-circus-riot.html"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/sbhowescircus.jpg" alt="" />It seems the clowns
picked the wrong
brothel.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This one was a hangout for some of the men in a local volunteer fire
brigade: The Hook &amp; Ladder Firefighting Company. [...]</p>
<p>No one seems to agree on exactly how the fight at the brothel got
started. Some blame a particularly loudmouthed clown. Some say the
clowns cut in line -- or knocked the hat off a fireman\&rsquo;s head. But
this much is clear: that night, the clowns kicked some firefighting
ass. At least two of the firemen were seriously injury, dragged out of
the brothel to safety as the Hook &amp; Ladder crew retreated. For the
rest of the night, the clowns could drink and screw in peace. [...]</p>
<p>By the time they got there, it had started. People were throwing
stones. And while the circus performers and the carnies were
apparently able to hold the mob off for a while, it couldn\&rsquo;t last.
Eventually, the crowd overwhelmed them. And when the Hook &amp; Ladders
arrived, all hell broke loose. They stormed the circus with pikes and
axes, overturned wagons, pulled down the tents and the Big Top and set
them on fire. They beat clowns to a pulp. Circus folk ran for their
lives. Some dove into the lake for safety. It was mayhem.</p>
<p>It took the mayor to settle things down. He came to the Fair Green in
person, kept a fireman from killing a clown with an axe by grabbing it
out of his hands, and called in the militia to take control of the
situation. Once things had calmed down, the circus performers came
back for their belongings and then ran like hell.</p>
<p>The police had done pretty much nothing. They just watched. Even Chief
Sherwood himself had eventually shown up, but could only claim to have
stopped the rioters from setting fire to the cages of the animals. Of
the 17 people who were charged in the riot, only one was ever
convicted. All of the police who were at the scene claimed they
couldn\&rsquo;t remember any of the Orangemen who had been there. Just like
they had a few weeks earlier, after the Fireman\&rsquo;s Riot on Church.</p>
