<p>I had done that already and even daily removed everything older than 28
days.
<img src="http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />
<br />
But I\&rsquo;m not sure if it might have been a problem of config leftovers
etc., because a few days after my post, I completely dumped my yacy
installation and everything in it to start from scratch.<br />
<br />
Of course, the index on my peer is not even half as large as it was
before, but yacy has been running like a charm for a whole week now, and
it\&rsquo;s still fast and everything works.<br />
<br />
When I first set up yacy a year ago or so, I immediately gave it a
number of very big crawls, and the index was quickly large enough to
make it unstable. So I gave up on it, later tried again, but kept my
config and only deleted the index. I then set up periodical index
cleaning, and that worked for a while, but still the index became too
large to handle, it seems. And: At some point when I was originally
trying to get it to work for more than a few hours, I had switched to
Generation Memory Strategy and had also fiddled with a lot of other
settings, hoping to make it work. These changes were never changed back,
and when I tried to switch back to Standard memory Strategy in January,
it didn\&rsquo;t work, it always set itself back to Generation Memory
Strategy.<br />
<br />
So it might be that something was very wrong with my settings, too.<br />
<br />
Now I\&rsquo;m back to defaults, and at least at the current index size of
about 4 million documents, everything works very smoothly. I didn\&rsquo;t
allow remote crawls this time, so the index doesn\&rsquo;t grow too much,
too.<br />
<br />
I\&rsquo;m now indexing the public parts of the Red Matrix (
<a href="https://redmatrix.me">https://redmatrix.me</a> ) daily, have yacy crawl everything I visit, and
accept DHT transfer. Let\&rsquo;s see how large the index can become now that
I\&rsquo;m back to defaults. And I think I\&rsquo;ll add periodic deletion of old
documents, anyway, maybe it will never grow too large then.</p>
