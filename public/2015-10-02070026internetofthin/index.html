<p><a href="http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/rinesi20150925"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/tumblr_mbx5qqpr191r4x5j7o1_1280.jpg" alt="" />The
price of the Internet of Things will be a vague dread of a malicious
world</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Volkswagen didn\&rsquo;t make a faulty car: they programmed it to cheat
intelligently. The difference isn\&rsquo;t semantics, it\&rsquo;s game-theoretical
(and it borders on applied demonology).</p>
<p>[...] Test the energy efficiency of a lamp, and you\&rsquo;ll get an
honest response from it. Objects fail, and sometimes behave
unpredictably, but they aren\&rsquo;t strategic, they don\&rsquo;t choose their
behavior dynamically in order to fool you. Matter isn\&rsquo;t evil.</p>
<p>But that was before. Things now have software in them, and software
encodes game-theoretical strategies as well as it encodes any other
form of applied mathematics, and the temptation to teach products to
lie strategically will be as impossible to resist for companies in the
near future as it has been to VW, steep as their punishment seems to
be. As it has always happened (and always will) in the area of
financial fraud, they\&rsquo;ll just find ways to do it better. [...]</p>
<p>So the fact is that our experience of the world will increasingly come
to reflect our experience of our computers and of the internet itself
(not surprisingly, as it\&rsquo;ll be infused with both). Just as any user
feels their computer to be a fairly unpredictable device full of
programs they\&rsquo;ve never installed doing unknown things to which
they\&rsquo;ve never agreed to benefit companies they\&rsquo;ve never heard of,
inefficiently at best and actively malignant at worst (but how would
you know?), cars, street lights, and even buildings will behave in the
same vaguely suspicious way. Is your self-driving car deliberately
slowing down to give priority to the higher-priced models? Is your
green A/C really less efficient with a thermostat from a different
company, or it\&rsquo;s just not trying as hard? And your tv is supposed to
only use its camera to follow your gestural commands, but it\&rsquo;s a bit
suspicious how it always offers Disney downloads when your children
are sitting in front of it.</p>
