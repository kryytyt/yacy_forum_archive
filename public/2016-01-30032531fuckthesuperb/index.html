Deal</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[...] the document which, it was revealed in January, allowed
the NFL to roll into San Francisco and rack up a \$5.3 million
(and, as of press time, growing) bill for city-provided police,
transit, and cleanup services.</p>

<p>After all, for these same services, the city of Santa Clara --
which is hosting the game at Levi\&rsquo;s Stadium, the San Francisco
49ers\&rsquo; new \$1.3 billion privately funded palace -- managed to
secure \$3.6 million up front from the Super Bowl Host Committee,
the collection of local civic and business leaders tasked with
bringing the Big Game to the Bay Area.</p>

<p>With still-fresh memories of the 2013 America\&rsquo;s Cup, when the
so-called \&ldquo;Super Bowl of yachting\&rdquo; arrived with promises of a
cash bonanza but set sail after sticking local taxpayers with a
\$11.5 million bill, they\&rsquo;re fair questions: Why couldn\&rsquo;t San
Francisco do the same? And who\&rsquo;s responsible for this particular
fumble? [...]</p>

<p>Lee exited the supervisors\&rsquo; chambers without ever answering
Peskin, whose attempt to ask a follow-up -- the same question as
before, actually -- was rebuffed by Board of Supervisors
President London Breed. [...]</p>

<p>Far from a \&ldquo;public subsidy\&rdquo; for the country\&rsquo;s richest
professional sports organization, as a budget analysts\&rsquo; report
called it, being Super Bowl City comes with free concerts and free
events, a gift for the public.</p>

On The
Clock</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As taxpayer costs related to Super Bowl City continue to increase,
we learn today that at least one city department is working hard
to keep expenses off the books. SFMTA officials, it seems, have
asked employees to \&ldquo;volunteer\&rdquo; as \&ldquo;ambassadors\&rdquo; for Super Bowl
City. This \&ldquo;volunteering\&rdquo; would be done during work hours, on
the clock, and the employees would be paid by SFMTA. Costs
associated with this volunteer work are not included in city
officials\&rsquo; \$5.3 million (and growing) estimated bill to
taxpayers for Super Bowl 50 celebrations, however, allowing
overall costs to appear lower than they really are.</p>

<li><p><a href="http://www.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2016/01/12/those-cameras-on-market-street-for-traffic-not-security-really">Why is Muni putting up \&ldquo;traffic\&rdquo; cameras in locations where there
will be no
cars?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>New cameras, to be precise, aimed at the street between First
Street and the Embarcadero, the area that will in a few weeks be
closed down to traffic to make way for the Super Bowl and the
\&ldquo;Super Bowl City\&rdquo; \&ldquo;fan village\&rdquo; [...]</p>

<p>They\&rsquo;re not even \&ldquo;security cameras\&rdquo; -- they\&rsquo;re <em>traffic</em>
cameras, according to SFTMA spokesman Paul Rose, and are meant to
keep an eye on buses and trains, not people. Nevertheless, privacy
advocates aren\&rsquo;t convinced, and fear the cameras could fall
victim to mission creep. [...]</p>

<p>\&ldquo;If these cameras are solely for traffic purposes, there needs to
be an enforceable policy that strictly limits their use for that
purpose,\&rdquo; said Matt Cagle, policy attorney for technology and
civil liberties at the American Civil Liberties Union. \&ldquo;The risk
here, as with so many other surveillance technologies, is that the
cameras will remain up after the Super Bowl is long over, and will
be used for purposes beyond just traffic control.\&rdquo;</p>

tents</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In what homeless advocates call a \&ldquo;cruel\&rdquo; move, Sup. Scott
Wiener is asking city departments to crack down on homeless people
who are living on the sidewalks in tents.</p>

<p>The El Niño rains have brought a proliferation of tent cities
along strips like Division Street, which is also under a highway
and more protected. There are some in Wiener\&rsquo;s district, too.</p>

<p>So he\&rsquo;s written to the police chief, the fire chief, the director
of public works, the director of public health, the head of human
services and the mayor\&rsquo;s homeless coordinator and asked,
\&ldquo;assuming the availability of shelter beds, what will be done to
remove illegal tent encampments from our streets .&hellip; Or will the
law continue to be ignored as it is being ignored today?\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.48hills.org/2016/01/22/el-nino-public-health-crisis-sf-dropping-ball/">El Niño is a public health
crisis</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>People living on our streets are at high risk for pneumonia or of
dying from exposure. On a recent outreach, our volunteer reported
that everyone she came in contact with was drenched and so were
their belongings. She could not help but notice a lot of people
were barefoot or wearing soaked socks.</p>

<p>The Super Bowl is around the corner, and so sweeps are even more
common than usual. According to one dripping young woman, the
Department of Public Works and the police did a sweep of her
encampment at 4th and Harrison at 6am -- during the downpour. She
and her group were told that they need to \&ldquo;move along\&rdquo; until
after the Stupid Bowl events and that an area that is considered a
\&ldquo;safe zone\&rdquo; is at Bryant and 7th, which so happens to be the
location of the county jail.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a bunch of dry areas have been fenced off in the past
two weeks. They are under freeways, away from businesses and
residential areas, but off limits to those seeking shelter. In the
middle of the rains, there are empty spaces where large
encampments were just last week, enclosed with fences topped with
razor blades. Meanwhile most homeless people are asking and
searching for where they can go without getting harassed. That
seems to be the question of the month.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mayor Ed Lee told the homeless they \&ldquo;have to leave\&rdquo; for the
Super Bowl. Join the Coalition on Homelessness as we protest the
mayor\&rsquo;s unjust plan and demand immediate housing for our city\&rsquo;s
unhoused residents. Meet up is at 4:30 in front of Sinbad\&rsquo;s on
Embacadero next to the Ferry Building. We are going to set up a
tent city, with plenty of visuals next to the superbowl city.
Bring signs and banners and cardboard cut-outs of houses. And
bring tents if you don\&rsquo;t mind them getting confiscated.</p>

<p>Homeless Statistics:</p>

<ul>
<li>There\&rsquo;s 1 shelter bed for every 6 homeless</li>
<li>There\&rsquo;s an 8,000 person long wait for housing</li>
<li>3,300 Children make up SF\&rsquo;s homeless</li>
<li>61% have disabilities</li>
<li>11,000 citations were given to homeless for resting in SF last
year</li>
</ul>

<p>Superbowl-Related Statistics:</p>

<ul>
<li>25% of the costs for Superbowl ads would be enough to end
homelessness in SF (Each 30-second Superbowl ad costs 5
million.)</li>
<li>The \$5 million cost to SF to host the Superbowl would house
500 homeless people.</li>
<li>SFPD is responsible for clearing out homeless people for the
Super Bowl by giving them citations which are already up 30%
from last year.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, yes, the homeless are being herded, the skyscrapers defaced,
our streets are clogged, and our tax money is being wasted. But
you wanna know the worst thing about the Super Bowl plopping its
nacho-stained Walmart sweatpants down on our fair city? The
horrific \&ldquo;official parties.\&rdquo; They are so awful!</p>

<p>Look, when Coldplay is your halftime act it can only go downhill
from there, but I didn\&rsquo;t think it could go this far down. We are
entering a bottomless pit of tacky that literally gouges my
eyeballs into black holes of abhorrence with each successive
Facebook invitation. My Bizarro World favorite so far? The 2016
Maxim Party, \&ldquo;in a class all its own as the #1 most sought after
event. Maxim is creating a premium ultra lounge featuring: concert
sound, theatrical lighting &amp; effects, full LED video walls and
risers for exclusive VIP Tables on different levels.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>GUYS THEY ARE GONNA HAVE TABLES ON DIFFERENT LEVELS! Where will
the innovation end? VIP tables (on different levels!) run you
\$8,500 -- \$25,000. Oh, and Paul McCartney might be there.
Thanks for ruining everything!</p>

Francisco</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything about the information above suggests that the event is
taking place in San Francisco. [...] In light of complaints, a
local organization, the Santa Clara Association of Merchants, has
drawn up plans to reincorporate the area within a half-mile radius
of Levi\&rsquo;s Stadium as a new city called San Francisco. It
wouldn\&rsquo;t be the first time a state has more than one city by the
same name. [...]</p>

<p>But what about fans who already booked hotel rooms in the original
San Francisco? Johnson says they can rely on the Bay Area\&rsquo;s
excellent public-transportation system to get to the big game in a
safe and timely manner.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;Let\&rsquo;s say you\&rsquo;re in Fisherman\&rsquo;s Wharf in the old San
Francisco. You just hop on the F streetcar, skip over to the
Embarcadero Muni station, get on the N train, take that to the
Caltrain station, ride Caltrain down to the Mountain View station,
transfer to the VTA Light Rail and take in the scenery as the
light rail whisks you to the stadium. Boom -- simple. Just three
and a half hours door to door, then another quick hour in the
security line at the stadium, and you\&rsquo;re done.\&rdquo;</p>
