Cloud Hosting, Part
2\&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that I have three options, in This Modern World:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Virtual server.<br />
<br />
Many options; the big ones are Amazon, Digital Ocean, Google. They
are probably all about the same. Price is somewhere between \$450
and \$800/month, maybe?<br />
<br />
Pro:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyone does it this way.</li>
<li>When it is Upgrade Season, spinning up a new instance for
rebuild/migration is easy.</li>
<li>I will never have to think about disk, RAM or power supplies
going bad.</li>
</ul>

<p>Con:
-   Expensive.
-   The way I would be using it would be to have a single instance.
    Nobody does it that way, so it probably doesn\&rsquo;t work very well.
-   I need 2TB of file system storage. Nobody does it that way, so
    it\&rsquo;s expensive.
-   Figuring out exactly <em>which</em> of their many options is the
    configuration that I need is really difficult.
-   Whatever IP address they give me is probably already on every
    email spam blacklist in the world.</p></li>

<li><p>Dedicated server.<br />
<br />
I\&rsquo;m seeing numbers anywhere from \$100/month to \$500/month. It\&rsquo;s
all over the map, which does not inspire confidence.<br />
<br />
Pro:</p>

<ul>
<li>It\&rsquo;s a real damned computer, with predicable behavior.</li>
<li>When disk, RAM or power supplies go bad, someone else fixes it.</li>
<li>I never need to physically visit it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Con:
-   It is hard to tell whether the companies that offer this service
    will still be in business two years from now.
-   It\&rsquo;s hard to tell whether they are real companies, or \&ldquo;one
    flaky guy\&ldquo;.
-   Spinning up a new instance in Upgrade Season is somewhat more
    involved, and maybe costs me a couple hundred bucks.
-   Though it <em>can</em> be located anywhere, since all of my customers
    are in San Francisco, it probably <em>should</em> be on the West Coast.
    That narrows the already narrow field of options.
-   People keep recommending companies that are not hosted in the
    country I live in. This strikes me as extremely foolish for
    several reasons.</p></li>

<li><p>Bare rack slot, with my own home-built 1U computer in it.<br />
<br />
Probably something like \$100/month, plus the cost of the computer
(say, \$1000, will last 4 years).<br />
<br />
Pro:</p>

<ul>
<li>It\&rsquo;s a real damned computer, with predicable behavior.</li>
<li>Cheap.</li>
</ul>

<p>Con:
-   Hardware failures are my problem.
-   Spinning up a new instance in Upgrade Season is a huge pain in
    the ass.
-   The data center has to be local, because I probably need to go
    physically visit it every year or two.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Figuring this out is <em>such</em> a pain in the butt. I really want to believe
that option 1 is the way to go, but I\&rsquo;d need to get the price down
(<em>without</em> first needing to completely re-design the way I do absolutely
everything, thanks), and it just sounds like it\&rsquo;s going to be flaky.</p>

<p>Options 2 and 3 sound flaky in their own ways. Pro: I already understand
those ways. Con: one of those ways is why I\&rsquo;m looking to move in the
first place.</p>
