<blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;It\&rsquo;s difficult to determine the exact number of dead pigs buried as
they have decayed, but there must be so many as the stink was so
strong that it caused several excavation workers to throw up,\&rdquo; said
the source, who had also witnessed the excavation. Earlier, he had
told authorities that \&ldquo;tens of thousands of dead pigs\&rdquo; had been
buried in the area. [...]</p>
<p>But the discovery was nevertheless alarming as it came just four years
after more than 6,000 dead pigs were dumped into local waterways in
Jiaxing, also in Zhejiang province. In March 2013, the rotting
carcasses were found in Shanghai\&rsquo;s Huangpu River, the source of
drinking water for the metropolis\&rsquo;s 23 million residents. [...]</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Once the carcasses decay, pollutants will certainly make their way
into the soil and the reservoir,\&rdquo; said one villager who asked for
anonymity because they have been told by authorities not to speak to
the media.</p>
<p>Local authorities haven\&rsquo;t tested the water in the area\&rsquo;s waterways,
including the reservoir in question, for possible contamination. It\&rsquo;s
unknown how many residents drink water from the reservoir and streams
nearby. [...]</p>
<p>The three sites on Dayin mountain have been cordoned off shortly after
excavation work began. But drone footage obtained by Caixin on
Wednesday shows workers in protective gear putting large black objects
into cardboard boxes next to mounds of earth piled up after digging up
several large pits.</p>
<p>One Xinghong employee told Caixin that the dark objects recovered were
decayed pig carcasses, and workers had taken boxes with animal
remnants back to the company for cremation. The wastewater and sludge
left in the pits was so thick that they had to use large pipes to
clean it up, he said.</p>
