<p>Date: 2016-12-09 23:22:28</p>

<p><a href="http://sfwater.org/index.aspx?page=884"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/tank-girl-water-malcolm-mcdowell.jpg" alt="" />They
are turning <em>our</em> atmosphere into <em>their</em>
atmosphere:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The SFPUC is aware that customers in San Francisco and throughout our
service area started to report taste and odor issues with their tap
water on Thursday, December 1st. We understand that there continues to
be a reported \&ldquo;earthy/musty\&rdquo; taste to the water. [...]</p>

<p>On average, 85% of the water we provide to you, our customers, comes
from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. The rest of the water we supply comes
from local Bay Area reservoirs. All of our reservoirs deliver
high-quality water to 2.6 million customers throughout the Bay Area.
As part of normal operations, our customers receive both local
reservoir water and Hetch Hetchy water.</p>

<p>Why does your water taste different now?</p>

<p>The week of November 28th, our operators made routine operational
changes to the system to bring local reservoir water levels down in
anticipation of rains. This included taking water out of San Antonio
Reservoir in the East Bay, and treating it at our Sunol Valley Water
Treatment Plant. We also reduced the flow of water coming from Hetch
Hetchy Reservoir. That operational activity stirred up sediments in
the pipeline. Complaints tracked the flow of the sediments, San
Antonio algae levels were extremely low, and standard odor tests were
normal. Thus, the pipeline sediment was believed to be the initial
source of the taste and odor issues.</p>

<p>Recent chemical testing in the system has shown the presence of a
dissolved compound called Geosmin that is a natural byproduct of blue
green algae in the water. Geosmin is found in foods like fish, grapes,
wine, and beets. This dissolved compound is not harmful from a public
health standard. However, this compound can cause taste and odor
issues in the drinking water supply, even if there are extremely small
amounts of it in the water (parts per trillion).</p>

You Know Where Your Water Comes
From?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bay Area water system is a byzantine patchwork of agencies --
more than 50 in all -- that provides water to customers. Some are the
ones you see on your water bill. Others are middlemen that provide
water to local agencies at the the wholesale level.</p>

<p>And some of that water makes a long journey. Southern California has
the reputation for tapping far-flung sources for its water needs, but
the Bay Area is in the same boat.</p>

<p>More than two-thirds of the Bay Area\&rsquo;s water supply comes from
outside the region, which means in extreme drought years like this
one, local water districts are competing with many others around the
state for limited supplies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://hoodline.com/2016/12/does-your-tap-water-taste-weird">A Hoodline commenter
said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reservoirs in Alameda and San Mateo counties are part of the SF
Department of Water &amp; Power system, as are other reservoirs upstream
between SF and Hetch Hetchy. SF sells most of the water to other
agencies on multi-decade contracts while using the electricity
generated to power government facilities and Muni (power was
originally supposed to be for citizens of SF). Blending has gone on
for many years in order to balance storage and demand throughout the
system. I\&rsquo;ve generally noticed a switch shortly after a few heavy
rains in fall/winter and when algae requires additional chloramine. It
will be interesting to hear feedback when local SF groundwater is
added to the mix for the western half of the city in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...but in a quick search, I wasn\&rsquo;t able to find a summary of what the
economics of all this are, or the status of PG&amp;E\&rsquo;s presumed ongoing
effort to strangle <a href="http://sfwater.org/index.aspx?page=998">Clean Power
SF</a>.</p>

<p>I think it was in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Water-Knife-Paolo-Bacigalupi/dp/080417153X/">Paolo Bacigalupi\&rsquo;s <em>The Water
Knife</em></a>
where someone characterized aquifers as buried glaciers: they spent a
hundred thousand years accumulating and rolling south until they got
spaded under, and now we\&rsquo;re draining them three orders of magnitude
faster than that.</p>
