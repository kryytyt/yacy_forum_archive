<p>I\&rsquo;ve had this terminal sitting under my desk gathering dust for...
close to two decades, I think. This is an <strong><a href="http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/annArborTerminals/Ambassador_Users_Guide_1982.pdf">Ann Arbor Ambassador
60</a>,</strong>
manufactured in 1982 or 1983. It is a <em>terminal</em>. You probably think
that word means \&ldquo;a GUI window that runs a command line shell in it\&ldquo;.
You think this thing must be a computer because it looks like what
computers used to look like. But it is not a computer, it is a
peripheral. This object consists of a keyboard, a serial port, and a CRT
screen, and that\&rsquo;s about it. A screen, I must emphasize, that is
capable of displaying only <em>text,</em> and that text can be in any two
colors you like, as long as those colors are <em>green</em> and <em>black</em>.</p>
<p>Look at the <em>sustain</em> on that phosphor. Just look at it! The video is a
little long, but it\&rsquo;s <em>moody</em>.</p>
<p>You plug the serial port on the back into the serial port of your
mainframe, or into a modem, and <em>boom</em>, <strong><em>Thus We Go Forth Into
Cyberspace.</em></strong></p>
<p>Now, this is a pretty sweet terminal, because as you see, it\&rsquo;s portrait
mode. Mos terminals of this 1982 vintage had 80x24 screens. This bad boy
does a glorious 80 columns by 60, <em>sixty</em> rows! You could emacs for
<em>days</em> on this thing, it was glorious.</p>
<p>And all this at a screaming 19,200 baud! That\&rsquo;s about two <em>kilobytes</em>
per second, and that means you could redraw the <em>entire screen</em> in under
<em>two and a quarter seconds!</em> Amazing! (Assuming you didn\&rsquo;t blow the
serial buffer, but more on that later.)</p>
<p>Actually this terminal has <em>two</em> serial ports. One is for the uplink,
and the other is for a printer. That\&rsquo;s right, this terminal could do a
screen shot of your <em>entire screen</em> of 60 lines of text right to your
<em>line printer!</em> The whole screen!</p>
<p>The keyboard is a bit mushy, and these days, being much more of a
keyboard connoisseur, I\&rsquo;m not very excited about the placement of some
of its keys. It plugs in with an RJ11 telephone cable, so who knows what
protocol it speaks. Certainly not something even as modern as PS/2 which
it predated by 5+ years.</p>

<p>So this box was just sitting there under my desk, not really in the way
but just getting dustier and dustier by the year, and I thought, what
the hell, it might as well be a computer. So I popped it open, made a
cable to internally bypass the serial port on the back panel, and
stuffed a Raspberry Pi 3 inside. I didn\&rsquo;t want to mess around with
figuring out how to pull 5v off of the board, not even knowing what the
built-in power supply is rated for, so I just patched a 3-prong plug in
right after the power switch and stuck a microUSB wall-wart inside the
shell.</p>
<p>I had to buy a cheap dingus to translate between what Raspberry Pis call
a \&ldquo;serial port\&rdquo; and what History knows as a serial port, though. Those
TX/RX pins on a Pi are TTL, that is, +0.5v to +5v, whereas \&ldquo;real\&rdquo;
serial is -12v to +12v (though Â±5v typically works). It is also a great
tragedy that you don\&rsquo;t get DSR/DTR lines on these \&ldquo;modern\&rdquo; serial
ports, which means you have to use inline XON/XOFF flow control. Like an
<em>animal.</em></p>
<p>Here\&rsquo;s a big surprise: even with the Pi inside this metal box, sitting
right next to the CRT coils, wifi still works just fine! So I didn\&rsquo;t
have to drill the case to stick an ethernet port on it. Not that this
thing is exactly in pristine condition -- as you can see, I
spray-painted it black at some point from its original lustrous beige
-- but it\&rsquo;s always nice to be able to do these things
non-destructively. I\&rsquo;m surprised that wifi works because the tube in
this thing throws off a likely-carcinogenic amount of EMF: there was a
time in the past when I had it sitting next to a color monitor, and when
this terminal was powered on it would make that monitor\&rsquo;s colors go
wonky from three feet away. Kind of impressive, really.</p>

<p>I did a significant portion of my Emacs development on this terminal.
When I was working from home, this is what I worked on. I think I wrote
BBDB and the byte-compiler on this thing.</p>
<p>I don\&rsquo;t remember how I ended up with it -- I probably liberated it
from work some time in the late 80s. But it served me well.</p>
<p>At one point, I built a 50\&rsquo; serial cable so that I could drag the
terminal out onto the back deck and work outside. I remember also
routing audio for a headphone jack over some of the unused lines inside
that cable, since I didn\&rsquo;t have speakers outside.</p>
<p>An elegant cable, from a simpler age.</p>
<p>Here\&rsquo;s the problem with this device, as you can see in the video: the
character buffer on the serial port is not large. I\&rsquo;m guessing it is
<em>dozens</em> of bytes deep. <em>Dozens.</em> And the CPU that moves those bytes
from the serial port into display memory is... not fast. So it keeps up
pretty well at 4800 baud, but at 9600, or when you light up the
afterburners and go for the full 19,200, it falls behind.</p>
<p>The way terminals deal with this is flow control: either end can say,
\&ldquo;Hold up, I am suffering\&rdquo; and data transmission stops until the other
side is ready. The proper way to do this over a serial connection is
with DSR/DTR lines, which are extra copper on the RS-232 cable, one for
each side, that signal when we\&rsquo;re ready to go. But as noted, the
not-quite-a-serial-port that Pis have doesn\&rsquo;t have that. Which leaves
you with inline flow control, XON and XOFF, typically the ASCII bytes
<code>^S</code> to stop and <code>^Q</code> to resume.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jwz.org/images/aaa60-2.jpg"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/aaa60-2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Nobody who uses Emacs can use XON and XOFF for flow control, because you
need <code>^S</code> and <code>^Q</code> to work, dammit.</p>
<p>So your only other option is, don\&rsquo;t send so fast, or send padding.</p>
<p>Back in the early Triassic, this led me to commit some indignities with
my termcap entries.</p>
<p>Termcap is the thing that tells the computer how terminals work: it\&rsquo;s a
database that describes the command set of each terminal. Because they
were all different: there were a lot of terminal manufacturers, and they
all invented their own languages for speaking to them. If you want to
move the cursor to a particular absolute position, you had to know that
on a VT52, it was this sequence of bytes, but on a Heath19, it was this
totally other sequence.</p>
<p>So I eventually figured out which sequences were the troublesome ones:
for example, I remember that the command for \&ldquo;clear screen and move to
the upper left corner\&rdquo; was a command that took the terminal a
relatively long time to execute: after all, it had to zero out <em>every
one of those 4,800 bytes</em> in the display RAM! This took it, let\&rsquo;s say,
5Ã as long as simply sending a character to the screen, which means the
serial buffer would accumulate a 5 byte debt and eventually fill up. So
the fix was to modify the termcap entry to tell it that the clear-screen
command should also send 5 NULs! The terminal ignores NULs, those don\&rsquo;t
go in the buffer, but they take up time on the serial line, allowing the
dislay processor to keep up!</p>
<p>Over a period of months, as I was running Emacs I would note when the
display would glitch out, make my best guess as to what display
addressing commands Emacs might have decided to send, and I manually
tweaked the number of NULs on the various termcap options until I really
had the thing completely dialed in.</p>
<p>Updating the screen efficiently is effectively a compiler-optimization
problem. You know what\&rsquo;s on the screen right now, and what you want it
to be, and you have to get from here to there using the absolute minimum
number of bytes, because each of those bytes takes an amount of time
that can actually be perceived by the user. NaÃ¯ve programs might just do
the obvious thing, and when they want to put text on line 3, they move
to line 3 and draw the text. But if you were running a sophisticated
lisp system that happened to have a text editor inside it, nothing so
simple would stand. It would run the permutations and figure out that
these two commands would both work, but this one was shorter. Or things
like: if I scroll three lines, mark a rectangle, and then indent that
rectangle by 5 spaces, I only have to send an additional 17 bytes to
finish up, instead of 480 to do the whole thing. The text-mode display
optimization module in Emacs was truly a \&ldquo;Here Be Dragons\&rdquo; situation.</p>
<p>Right, so since I haven\&rsquo;t really used this terminal since the Clinton
administration, here I am using it with a \&ldquo;modern\&rdquo; Unix system, so
I\&rsquo;m back to the stock termcap entry instead of my customized one (oh,
sorry, it\&rsquo;s not <em>termcap</em> any more, now it\&rsquo;s <em>terminfo</em>, which is
exactly the same but totally different for no reason, you kids why I
oughta) and with the stock entry, the screen glitches in a most
undignified manner. Time to dig down into the archives, and...</p>

<p>Except... it turns out that file is actually <em>too old</em>. It\&rsquo;s got
entries for Concept-LNZ, an entry to fix some bugs in the idiosyncratic
Heath19 emulation that Perqs used, and a hacked version of the VT100
termcap that worked with the TI Explorer terminal emulator (which had
the bug that absolute cursor addressing used variable-width numbers
instead of fixed-width. That looked like
<code>&quot;cm=5\E[%i%2;%dH&quot;</code>{style=&ldquo;white-space: nowrap; font-weight: bold;&ldquo;}, in
case you were wondering. Greets to Crash Override and also Joey.)</p>
<p>But my carefully-crafted aaa-60 termcap entry, that piece of perfection
that looked almost exactly like line noise, is now lost to us forever.</p>
<p>Alas.</p>
<p>Sometimes people ask me why my web sites use those colors. This is a
thing that people sometimes ask.</p>
