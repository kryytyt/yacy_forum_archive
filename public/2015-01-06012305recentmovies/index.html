<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDuUcA3ykAI">American Mary:</a></strong> Girl
drops out of med school and takes up a career in extreme body
modification and revenge torture. It\&rsquo;s fucked up. I liked it. There is
less gratuitous stripper nonsense than the trailer shows.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdfL_MvOT8U">Wetlands:</a></strong> This is one
of the filthiest movies I\&rsquo;ve ever seen, and I mean that in both senses
of the word. Anal fissures are a major plot point, and it\&rsquo;s German so
<em>of course</em> there\&rsquo;s chest-shitting.</p>

<p><strong>Trouble Every Day:</strong> It\&rsquo;s a vampire movie. There, I spoiled it for
you. Everyone\&rsquo;s a creep and really sad. I should know better than to
watch anything with Vincent Gallo in it.</p>

<p><strong>The Countess:</strong> Julie Delpy does the story of Erzebet Bathory and her
innovative skin-care regime. It\&rsquo;s a little slow, but good.</p>

<p><strong>The Anomaly:</strong> Super-assassin has his memory reset every few minutes
and wakes up in the middle of a heist somewhere else. It\&rsquo;s a lousy
enough retread of old ideas that I expected to see P. K. Dick\&rsquo;s name
pop up (since there have been a thousand movies \&ldquo;based on\&rdquo; his work
and exactly one was any good).</p>

<p><strong>I Origins:</strong> There was a germ of an interesting idea in here -- \&ldquo;I
think I found physical evidence that my Manic Pixie Dream Girlfriend was
reincarnated as an Indian street urchin!\&rdquo; -- but every character was
an irritating piece of shit and the dirtbag convenience-store clerk
playing the lead was completely unbelievable as a scientist.</p>

<p><strong>The Woman in Black:</strong> This movie lost me when 20 minutes had gone by
and I had already been repeatedly subjected to ham-handed foley scares.
Here\&rsquo;s a hint: pipes in old houses don\&rsquo;t make 110 dB dubstep-drop
<strong><em>boom</em></strong> noises. And even if they did, that\&rsquo;s <em>terrible film-making</em>
unless what happens immediately next is \&ldquo;the sink actually explodes\&rdquo;
rather than, \&ldquo;oh look, it is actually a fully functional sink.\&rdquo; Then
later there was a floating Scooby Doo creeper in a cheap Halloween mask
or something. I\&rsquo;ve already forgotten.</p>

<p><strong>The Device:</strong> Finding the Alien MacGuffin makes everyone act like
assholes. Snore.</p>

<p><strong>The Signal:</strong> I think this was better when it was called
<em>\&ldquo;Laserblast\&rdquo;</em>. I feel sad for Laurence Fishburne that money is so
tight that he decided to be in this.</p>

<p><strong>The One I Love:</strong> This wasn\&rsquo;t bad, but really it was a 30 minute
episode of <em>Tales From The Darkside</em> stretched out to feature length.
It\&rsquo;s better if nobody has spoiled the central twist for you before you
watch it.</p>

<p><strong>Soulmate:</strong> Attempted suicide meets actual suicide, has tea. Gonna go
with <em>Tales From The Darkside</em> again. Though it was refreshing to see a
ghost story that was trying to have a plot instead of only being scary.</p>

<p><strong>Drinking Buddies:</strong> Sad, dissatisfied people realize they aren\&rsquo;t
happy with their relationships, change things, nothing changes. I was
going to say, \&ldquo;Hey, they\&rsquo;re still making 90s slacker angst movies!\&rdquo;
except if this was one of those there would have been a bunch of
overwrought monologues. It wasn\&rsquo;t a bad movie but it was just a total
bummer.</p>

<p><strong>Dead Before Dawn:</strong> I just remember a lot of running and screaming and
drooling. And then maybe it was all a dream? Yeah, I\&rsquo;ve already
forgotten it.</p>

<p>...on a related note, is there a replacement yet for tvtorrents.com
that works with flexget?</p>
