<p><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/under_attack_pleas_stand_by_by_heder.png" alt="" />Dear
Lazyweb: What are reasonable reverse engineering tools for web sites?</p>
<p>It seems like every few months I find myself cracking the login and
upload or download process on some site -- sorry, some \&ldquo;web
application\&ldquo;. Invariably they either don\&rsquo;t provide an API, or their
API is wholely inadequate. The \&ldquo;new web\&rdquo; doesn\&rsquo;t want you to script
it, because that might prevent them from forcing lock-in on you. They
all want to be titans of the industry like Compuserve or AOL, apparently
not having heard about this little thing called \&ldquo;The Internet\&rdquo; that
got really popular for a minute back in the 90s.</p>
<p>So to do the things I want to do, I often have to crack their
undocumented protocols and halfassed security measures. I don\&rsquo;t enjoy
it, but for my sanity and out of self defense, I do it a lot. <a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/nation-suddenly-realizes-this-just-going-to-be-a-t-30195">\&ldquo;Nation
Suddenly Realizes This Just Going To Be A Thing That Happens From Now
On\&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>The kind of discoveries I end up needing to make usually look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their OAuth \&ldquo;application\&rdquo; API is inadequate and intentionally
crippled, so let\&rsquo;s go straight for the web login page and get a
session cookie.</li>
<li>Oh look, here\&rsquo;s the magic URL you are squirting JSON data down.</li>
<li>Oh, but the arguments to that URL are signed.</li>
<li>Oh, here\&rsquo;s the signing key you embedded in the code but tried to
hide.</li>
<li>(And you\&rsquo;re sniffing user agents. Aw, that\&rsquo;s cute.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don\&rsquo;t have proper tools to easily do the sorts of things I need to do
to solve these problems. I mean, I manage, obviously, but it sucks. Here
are the kind of questions I find myself asking that are harder to answer
than they should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>This form\&rsquo;s \&ldquo;Submit\&rdquo; button isn\&rsquo;t actually a form element, and
the source doesn\&rsquo;t have an <code>onclick</code> handler on it. Something
somewhere else has installed a handler ...somewhere... so that
when I click it, a JS function runs and a URL gets loaded. What
function? What URL?</li>
<li>Clicking this thing reads and writes a bunch of data to random URLs
via <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, then does a redirect. What URLs did it load
and what did it send and recieve? Sometimes I can answer this
question using the Resources or Timeline panel in Safari\&rsquo;s
inspector, but as far as I can tell, the intermediate data vanishes
from the timeline as soon as the top-level URL changes, or the DOM
gets zeroed out, or something. I don\&rsquo;t know. I just know that I
can\&rsquo;t see a record of URLs being loaded that I know were loaded.
Mozilla and Firebug don\&rsquo;t seem to be any better than Safari in this
respect. \&ldquo;Oh, the document is gone, you must not care about it any
more.\&rdquo;</li>
<li>This page does some Javascript contortions and eventually emits a
<code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag and configures it via JS. Eventually that tag
initiates network activity. What URL is it loading? It doesn\&rsquo;t show
up in the inspector. It is happening out-of-process?</li>
<li>A URL is being loaded at the bottom of a giant stack of obfuscated,
minimized Javascript. What\&rsquo;s the call stack? Basically: if I lived
in a world where \&ldquo;javascript debugger\&rdquo; was a thing that actually
existed (ha ha ha), how do I set a breakpoint on any network
activity?</li>
</ul>
<p>I could use mitmproxy and Wireshark for some of this, but that\&rsquo;s a huge
pain in the ass, and more heavy-handed that I usually need. Also
Wireshark is awful (it always leaves me thinking \&ldquo;How was this supposed
to be any better than tcpdump?\&ldquo;) It makes much more sense to intercept
this stuff inside the browser. All the information is in there since
it\&rsquo;s the thing initiating contact with the server.</p>
