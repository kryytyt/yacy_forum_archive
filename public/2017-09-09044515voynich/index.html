<p><a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/voynich-manuscript-solution/">The solution to the Voynich
manuscript.</a></p>
<p>Alas, it\&rsquo;s <em>prosaic</em> quackery, not even <em>interesting</em> quackery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By now, it was more or less clear what the Voynich manuscript is: a
reference book of selected remedies lifted from the standard treatises
of the medieval period, an instruction manual for the health and
wellbeing of the more well to do women in society, which was quite
possibly tailored to a single individual.</p>
<p>The script had hitherto proved resistant to interpretation and
presented several hurdles. Medieval lettering is notoriously fickle:
individual letter variations, styles and combinations are confusing at
the best of times. I recognized at least two of the characters in the
Voynich manuscript text as Latin ligatures, <em>Eius</em> and <em>Etiam.</em>
Ligatures were developed as scriptorial short-cuts. They are composed
of selected letters of a word, which together represent the whole
word, not unlike like a monogram. An ampersand is just such an
example. [...] Systematic study of every single character in the
Lexicon identified further ligatures and abbreviations in the Voynich
manuscript and set a precedent. It became obvious that each character
in the Voynich manuscript <em>represented an abbreviated word and not a
letter.</em> [...]</p>
<p>One other noticeable difference from the <em>Herbarium Apuleius
Platonicus</em> is that not a single plant name or malady is to be found
in the Voynich manuscript. This was problematic until I realized that
not only had the folios of the manuscript been cropped (the images of
flowers and roots have been severed and the tops of folios hacked)
but, more importantly, the indexes that should have been there were
now absent. Indexes are present in many other similar books: a system
of cross-reference for illness, complaints, names of plants and page
numbers. For the sake of brevity, the name of both plant and malaise
were superfluous in the text so long as they could be found in the
indexes matched with a page number. Recipes require an index to
function in a reference book. The same recipe format is replicated
throughout the manuscript: recipes for bathing solutions, tonics,
tinctures, ointments, unguents, purgatives and fragrant fumigations
-- and not a name in sight. Not only is the manuscript incomplete,
but its folios are in the wrong order -- and all for the want of an
index.</p>
