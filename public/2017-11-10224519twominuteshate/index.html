Twitter just verified the account of the man who organized the tiki
torch white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that ended with the
death of Heather

take a break for a minor rant about shitty engineering and bad company
philosophies.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jack Dorsey has time to shop for slim-cut \&ldquo;Stay Woke\&rdquo; shirts but
apparently it was a low priority problem to learn what abuse on
Twitter looked like and filter it out. Twitter-the-company is made up
of people that have consistently made poor, self-serving decisions
while patting themselves on the back for making the world more
connected. Well, fuck you all. You gluttons helped put us all here and
now suddenly you might come up with an algorithm to spot Nazis?
Here\&rsquo;s an idea to put on your fucking Trello board: Look for avatars
with swastikas on day one. Take day two off to recover from your code
bash hangover. Day three you can look for accounts that mostly post
negative sentiments (using a Python library that\&rsquo;s five years old)
and then map their connections to find another Nazi pool-party. On day
four, take another break. You deserve a rest for waiting a decade to
do even the smallest amount of engineering work to make the world
better. Day five might be busy while your executives are explaining to
congress why you actively assisted a foreign government to spread
disinformation during the US election. Also, enjoy your weekend you
fucks. [...]</p>
<p>Let\&rsquo;s put aside the Nazis, and Russian trolls, and the bigots, and
the fake news mongers. That\&rsquo;s a hell of a start to a thought
experiment, but let\&rsquo;s pretend we don\&rsquo;t care about those terrible
things. The last year has been better for me without Twitter. I\&rsquo;m
much less distracted by meaningless information. I spend more time
talking to my family. I\&rsquo;ve focused on actual friends that I want to
consciously cultivate.</p>
<p>I once thought that Twitter was terrific for staying up on current
affairs and staying plugged into the news. I now realize that just
isn\&rsquo;t true. Twitter is mostly useless garbage. Anything with real
meaning and value will distill up to other sources. By relying on
Twitter as an information feed, I asked for a planet of lazy
reactionaries to tell me what I should think is important. Now,
instead of using Twitter, I read actual journalism. The first thing I
read in depth was about Richard Nixon. This helped me to understand
just how bad a terrible president like Trump could be. While that
didn\&rsquo;t help me cope (because, Nixon was a terrible disgusting person
and we are all still suffering from his bullshit) it did teach me
something real instead of someone\&rsquo;s theory about meaningless garbage.</p>
<p>If you are a Twitter user, answer this. Keep it to yourself, but try
to be honest. What valuable thing have you learned from Twitter in the
past 48 hours? Was it about an Apple product or something about some
tech startup not liking poor people on their commuter buses? Did you
take action on the information? I\&rsquo;m not going to judge you, but I
will tell you that in my experience what Twitter gave me was almost
never valuable and it certainly came to the exclusion of actual joy.</p>
<p>So here I am, 12 months later. I\&rsquo;m still saying \&ldquo;Fuck you Twitter\&rdquo;
and I mean it more than I did in 2016. Today we have real data to show
the malevolence of Dorsey, Williams, and the cadre of people that make
up their company. My life is better without Twitter, but unfortunately
Twitter still has an effect on my life. It\&rsquo;s still a malignant force
and I think about its consequences every morning like it\&rsquo;s November
9th 2016.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://benicetobears.com/2017/09/26/twitter-adds-280-characters/">Twitter Is Literally a White Supremacist Website. For its entire life,
it has ignored mountains of racism (and every other form of abuse),
because to kick off all the Nazis and hysterical racists would lower its
engagement statistics in the short
term.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>They don\&rsquo;t just let people stay on the platform though, they verify
tons of racists. The \&ldquo;verification system\&rdquo; has never really been
just about verifying that people are using their real identity, but
has always been about giving a special status to interesting/special
people. That\&rsquo;s why Twitter stripped Milo Yhateverhisnameis of his
verification as a punishment, and why you can\&rsquo;t just get verified by
proving to them that you are posting under your real identity.
Verified users also get special features added to their accounts.
[...]</p>
<p>I\&rsquo;m not really an expert on white supremacy, but I know it\&rsquo;s a
system. As an example, my understanding is basically that if a
restaurant opens up, and then half its customers are neo-Nazis, and
they constantly yell the n-word at the other customers, and the
restaurant refuses to do anything about it, and then also the
restaurant has some sort of special status system like \&ldquo;best customer
club\&rdquo; and they give that to a bunch of the neo-nazis, seems like you
might actually say that was a white supremacist restaurant. Seems
about right I think, right? So that\&rsquo;s why I say that Twitter is
literally a white supremacist website, and everyone who makes any
decisions there, especially Jack Dorsey, is a white supremacist. I\&rsquo;m
sure he\&rsquo;s a nice guy, and I know he loves tweeting about rap music
and stuff, but the way it works is that actually, he\&rsquo;s a huge white
supremacist, because he literally controls an entire system and
refuses to fix all the racist shit.</p>
<p>Okay, so enough about the background, back to the news: White
supremacist social networking site Twitter is going to let some people
do 280 character tweets.</p>
