<blockquote>
<p>Mitch McConnell, prince of dust, took his current form on February 20,
1942, molded of a strange flesh, his mouth open and already seeking.</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, for whom the ghouls slaver, spent his childhood
crushing spiders in paper napkins and stuffing them into his mouth,
one after the other, and never was he seen to expel them at all.</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, who waits in the gravel pit, attended high school in
Georgia, where he sat with the cobwebs and giggled, and would not say
where all the town\&rsquo;s dogs had gone.</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, possessor of a human smile, frequently took it out of
its jar to woo his wives. They would admire it, play with it, but only
Sherrill asked where it had come from. Elaine does not care.</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, lord of misrule, moved to Kentucky in a single night.
Those houses he passed sickened, and lie even now, windowless, in
gardens of ash.</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, whose handshake is like grasping an ankle, ran for
the senate in 1984. He performs no real function there. He only sits
in his office and smells the women walking by, even up to three miles
away.</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, weaver of cartilage, has three children. Nothing is
known of them. He has three children. He has three children, all his
own. He has three children. You mustn\&rsquo;t touch them, those three
children.</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, beloved of frogs, is always facing you. The longer he
watches you the more sweat you see on his face. But he says nothing.
There is a pulse in his chin. And still he says nothing. Mitch
McConnell, priest of the unshriven, gnaws upon cotton during votes,
which he tallies with rows of dead flies. His colleagues know to leave
immediately after voting, or, grinning, he will force them to eat
their tally mark.</p>

srcset=&ldquo;https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/768/2017/dqlqwc5ueaasags.jpg 800w, https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/768/2017/dqlqwc5ueaasags.jpg 768w, https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/640/2017/dqlqwc5ueaasags.jpg 640w, https://www.jwz.org/images/scaled/360/2017/dqlqwc5ueaasags.jpg 360w&rdquo;}</a>Mitch
McConnell, the dampness between the toes, knows intimately the taste
of stone. When in his confusion he takes hold of your shoulder and
feels your bones, he only wants to know that taste again. When his
fingers touch your ribs and his jaw stretches open --</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, whose inward parts are wet cardboard, does not
understand the sun. He sees it from his window each day and vows anew
to destroy it. His children assure him he can, and then he smiles and
kisses their tough, soft faces like old earlobes.</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, licker of shrouds, believes in God. He feels he must,
for people cry out to Them so often in his presence that it is best to
assume God is there somewhere. And it is also best to stop that
crying, but then he must in turn stop the struggling, but then</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, whose true name is a worn tooth, tells his
cartilaginous children that corporations are people. And his children
agree, and he smiles and kisses their foreheads, where after all these
years the slime of their creation is still wet.</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, drinker of vipers, is not a scientist. He distrusts
them, in fact. They know too much. They might know about HIM. So he
chews on some red ragged thing and makes a plan he will forget by
daylight.</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, whose tongue is far too sleek, has a gun. He kisses
it every noon and calls it by Elaine\&rsquo;s name. His children smile and
kiss it as well, with their lips like tendons. Mitch wants everyone to
have an Elaine to love.</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, whose breath smells of hawthorn, loves his children.
One day he will love them so much they will crawl back into his mouth
&amp; nestle there. And then so will we, smiling &amp; free from sin. He loves
us. He forgives us. One day we\&rsquo;ll understand. He looks forward to it.</p>
