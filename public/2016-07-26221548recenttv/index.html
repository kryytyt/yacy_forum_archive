<p><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/videodrome-2.jpg" alt="" />In lieu of sleeping, I
watch television. I have opinions. In no particular order, here\&rsquo;s some
stuff I\&rsquo;ve watched recently:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Preacher:</strong> This is the best thing on TV right now, and is an
amazingly faithful adaptation of the comics. I haven\&rsquo;t read them in
years, but I loved the shit out of them back in the day, and so far
this is doing justice to all of the characters. Cassidy, especially,
is <em>spot on</em>. The TV version of Tulip is <em>much</em> more interesting,
too: in the show she\&rsquo;s a person, but in the comic she was The
Girlfriend. The first season seems to be building to Jesse giving
<em>The Sermon</em> in the finale, and just about every episode ends with
an \&ldquo;Oh shit, here it comes\&rdquo; feeling. I am loving this so much.</li>

<li><p><strong>Mr. Robot:</strong> Season one was absolutely incredible in every
particular. It\&rsquo;s impossible to talk about my favorite parts without
massive spoilers, but there\&rsquo;s a bit where they do <em>a cliché thing</em>
and you\&rsquo;re thinking \&ldquo;Oh, you\&rsquo;re not going to do <em>the cliché
thing</em> are you?\&rdquo; and then there\&rsquo;s an instrumental music cue that
is the most perfect music cue of all time because in just a few
seconds it says, \&ldquo;Not only are we doing <em>the cliché thing</em> but we
know it and we know you know it and we are going <em>all in</em> on <em>the
cliché thing</em>.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>Also: it is best to view <em>Mr. Robot</em> as a sequel to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100436/"><em>Pump Up the
Volume</em></a> in much the same way
that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119229/"><em>Grosse Point Blank</em></a> is
a sequel to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098258"><em>Say Anything</em></a>
(Lloyd Dobbler found that kickboxing didn\&rsquo;t work out and joined the
army) and that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1819509/"><em>Don\&rsquo;t Trust the Bitch in Apartment
23</em></a> is the prequel to
<em>Jessica Jones</em> (back when Jessica and Patsy lived together before
meeting Killgrave -- Jessica was way more fun and less uptight back
then).</p>

<p>Anyway, season two of <em>Mr. Robot</em> is not really impressing me yet. I
hope they get their shit together.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Magicians:</strong> It took me a few episodes to warm to this,
because I have no time for Harry Potter (a series about how hard it
is being the popular jock who\&rsquo;s good at everything) and this series
sounds like it\&rsquo;s going to be \&ldquo;Hogwarts, The Graduate School
Years\&ldquo;, but it\&rsquo;s not really that, and it gets pretty dark pretty
fast, e.g., the \&ldquo;C. S. Lewis / Lewis Carroll was a pedophile\&rdquo;
subplot. It feels much more \&ldquo;real world\&rdquo; than most shows about
magic do, and the characters actually have recognizable
personalities. This show is excellent.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Expanse:</strong> This might be the best science fiction I\&rsquo;ve ever
seen on TV. It\&rsquo;s actually science fiction, not \&ldquo;a western in
spaaaace\&rdquo; like so much that passes for it is. The world-building is
amazingly complex, the politics seem sensible, it has good
characterizations, and probably the best physics I\&rsquo;ve seen in a
scifi TV or movie since <em>2001.</em> The writers <em>understand gravity and
inertia</em> if you can believe that. I know, right?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Stranger Things:</strong> I would like to thank everyone who has been
<em>raving</em> about this show for being so vocal about it, and thereby
letting me know that I should utterly disregard your opinion on
everything, ever. This is the biggest piece of trash I\&rsquo;ve seen
since... well, since the last piece of saccharine pabulum that
Spielberg vomited onto the screen. It\&rsquo;s a ham-handed Spielberg /
Stephen King pastiche, and it\&rsquo;s <em>just as bad</em> as the warmed over,
Very Special Episode 80s crap it is imitating, but nostalgia is a
hell of a drug, so the fact that it is doing a decent job of
imitating barely-remembered <em>crap</em> passes for depth with a lot of
people, I guess?</p>

<p>This is a show that had Amnesia Psychic Girl actually say the line,
\&ldquo;Friend? What is <em>friend?</em>\&rdquo;</p>

<p>Someone actually wrote that down. Someone wrote that down and
thought, \&ldquo;Yes! Nailed it!\&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a makeover montage. A god damned <em>makeover montage.</em></p>

<dl>
<dt>It\&rsquo;s basically this:</dt>
<dt>::: {style=&ldquo;text-align: center; width: 100%; max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto;&ldquo;}
:::</dt>
</dl></li>

<li><p><strong>Orphan Black:</strong> Still amazing. Watch this show! If you are even
remotely considering watching <em>Sense8</em>, stop that, and watch this
instead, because anything that was interesting in <em>Sense8</em> was
already covered by <em>Orphan Black</em> by season 3, and in a less stupid
way, and using characters you actually give a shit about (most of
whom are played by the same person, which I still can hardly
believe).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Wynonna Earp:</strong> This show is pretty dumb, but it\&rsquo;s fun-dumb in
the way mid-series <em>Supernatural</em> was dumb (the period when they
kind of just said \&ldquo;fuck it\&rdquo; to making any sense, but before they
ran out of ideas). The first few episodes are kind of hard to take,
mostly because the writers didn\&rsquo;t seem to be in agreement over
whether the little sister\&rsquo;s character was supposed to be 16 or 25,
but it picks up. There\&rsquo;s a lot of shooting demons in the face, and
it\&rsquo;s the most \&ldquo;open carry\&rdquo; show I\&rsquo;ve ever seen. I wonder what
part of Canada is standing in for Arizona here.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Fear the Walking Dead:</strong> This show exists solely to remind you
that <em>The Walking Dead</em> could be <em>so much worse</em>. You will love this
show if you watched <em>The Walking Dead</em> and said to yourself, \&ldquo;You
know what this show was missing? All of the incuriosity, pointless
secret-keeping and one-note unsympathetic non-characters that I came
to expect from <em>Lost</em>.\&rdquo; This show is the walking embodiment of,
\&ldquo;Why did the character decide to do the thing? Because the plot
demanded it.\&rdquo; Fuck this show.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Dark Matter:</strong> I call this \&ldquo;Amnesia Firefly\&ldquo;. If you give your
characters amnesia, they don\&rsquo;t have to have personalities! If you
keep giving them amnesia over and over again, you can keep rewriting
the same episode! Avoid.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Killjoys:</strong> It\&rsquo;s another <em>Firefly</em> ripoff, and it\&rsquo;s not a whole
lot better, but at least two of the characters have something
approaching motivation. There seems to be some complex
world-building in the background, but it\&rsquo;s a slow reveal.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Powers:</strong> The first half of season one was pretty lousy, but it
picked up (naked Eddie Izzard eating people! how can you not love
that!), and season two is getting good. If you watched the first
season of <em>Heroes</em> and wanted to throw things at the TV the whole
time, this might be the show that you wished that was.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Penny Dreadful:</strong> Or, \&ldquo;The League of Extraordinarily Bloody
Gentlemen\&ldquo;. Season one was perfection. Season two was pretty good.
Season three was a betrayal: just avoid it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt:</strong> I find this show hilarious.
Apparently the people who do not find this show hilarious are people
who did not find <em>30 Rock</em> hilarious. So let that be your guide.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend:</strong> Ok, stay with me here. This is actually a
<em>musical</em>. Like, a full-on, people stop talking and break into song
and dance numbers three times an episode <em>musical</em>. How did this
happen? How is this a thing that exists? How is this so <em>funny?</em>
Because it\&rsquo;s really funny. It\&rsquo;s as if <em>Kimmy Schmidt</em> was produced
by Bialystock and Bloom.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Black Sails:</strong> There is really a lot of excellent pirating in this
show. Excellent pirating. Pirating and whoring and quite a lot of
historically accurate pubic hair. The seasons tend to bog down and
get a little talky in the middle, but they bookend it with some
amazing naval battles. And even when it\&rsquo;s talky, it\&rsquo;s pretty
great. Like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flint: That\&rsquo;s not why you did it.</p>

<p>Silver: Really? Would you like to tell me why I did it, then?</p>

<p>Flint: Well, I wasn\&rsquo;t there, but, I\&rsquo;d hazard the guess that you
learned of what had happened, told him how fucking stupid he was,
and in that moment, he gave you a look that amounted to something
less than contrite. And in that moment, you felt it.</p>

<p>Silver: Felt what?</p>

<p>Flint: Darkness. Hate. Showing indifference to the authority that
you sacrificed so much to acquire, disdain for refusing to
acknowledge that his actions, had you not intervened, would have
led to an outcome that he would have held you responsible for
reversing. Pride. Questioning what kind of man you are if you
don\&rsquo;t seek retribution for the offense.</p>

<p>Silver: So what are you saying? You saying I went too far with
him?</p>

<p>Flint: Maybe you went too far. Maybe you didn\&rsquo;t go far enough.
Maybe you did it just right. The point is that while you were
doing it, you heard a voice telling you that disciplining him
would prevent him from repeating the offense, a voice that sounded
like reason, and there was reason to it, as the most compelling
lies are comprised almost entirely of the truth. But that\&rsquo;s what
it does. Cloaks itself in whatever it must to move you to action.
And the more you deny its presence, the more powerful it gets, and
the more likely it is to consume you entirely without you ever
even knowing it was there. Now, if you and I are to lead these men
together, you must learn to know its presence well so that you may
use it ... Rather than it use you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, it\&rsquo;s a prequel to <em>Treasure Island</em>. You don\&rsquo;t need to know
anything about <em>Treasure Island</em> to follow it, but if you want to, I
recommend <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025907/">the 1934 version</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Outlander:</strong> Our protagonist\&rsquo;s problem is that she\&rsquo;s just too
smart and too good at everything, and too many people keep falling
in love with her, so she keeps needing to be rescued by a brooding
shirtless kilt. This is the most \&ldquo;Mary Sue\&rdquo; thing I have ever seen
in my life. It\&rsquo;s awful.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Lucifer:</strong> Speaking of Mary Sues, this show is basically identical
to <em>Castle:</em> that is to say, \&ldquo;I don\&rsquo;t give a shit about your
stupid mismatched-buddy-cop police procedural -- oh, no chief,
please don\&rsquo;t partner me with the witty and charming outsider\&rdquo; --
but I watched it for a few episodes because that guy <em>is</em> kind of
charming. But yeah, I gave up on it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Ash vs Evil Dead:</strong> So, remember that scene, where Bruce Campbell
is fighting his possessed hand and it keeps smashing plates over his
head? If you want to see a series that is basically that scene over
and over again, this is the series for you. (Note: I do, and so this
is the series for me.)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Another Period:</strong> This is the actually-watchable version of
<em>Downton Abbey</em>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Outcast:</strong> How can you make exorcisms <em>so boring?</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>12 Monkeys:</strong> This is pretty lousy, and it\&rsquo;s clear at this point
that the writers have no plan at all, and are going to just keep
palimpsesting over the plot as needed to keep it going. Bleh. But
you have to admire what\&rsquo;s-his-name\&rsquo;s commitment to maintaining 5
days of stubble. It\&rsquo;s a <em>Miami Vice</em> level of tonsorial devotion.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Blindspot, Gotham, The Strain:</strong> These shows are bullshit.</p></li>
