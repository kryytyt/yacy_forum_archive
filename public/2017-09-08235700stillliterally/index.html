role in electing
Trump</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Putin\&rsquo;s propaganda farm bought around \$150,000 in political ads from
at least June 2015 - May 2017; Facebook was compelled to share the
information and will be cooperating with ongoing investigations into
Russian interference in the 2016 election. The troll farm in question
is the Internet Research Agency, a well-funded, well-established,
nimble, English-speaking pro-Putin propaganda unit, and the ads are in
all likelihood illegal. [...]</p>
<p>The total money spent (that Facebook would admit to) was allegedly
responsible for around 3,000 ads with the potential to reach millions
of people. Facebook isn\&rsquo;t saying how many people <em>actually</em> saw them.</p>
<p>There were an additional 2,200 ads Facebook said it suspected were
also Russia backed; the company has avoided making a positive
statement. It\&rsquo;s arguable that the world\&rsquo;s biggest surveillance
platform has the data to connect the dots; it simply isn\&rsquo;t doing so
for this problem. [...]</p>
<p>The language that Facebook \&ldquo;discovered\&rdquo; this is disingenuous. As if
it had no way of monitoring its ad program, and a Russian troll farm
blasting propaganda was akin to finding a coin purse someone left
under a cushion. Whoa! Who knew, or had any way of knowing? Well,
Facebook did.</p>
<p>Pretending otherwise is fool\&rsquo;s errand; no one could be that
incompetent at running advertising and metrics and simultaneously have
the entire industry in a choke-hold. [...]</p>

<p>The primary talking point is that the accounts have been removed
because, by gosh, they violated Facebook\&rsquo;s rules. They \&ldquo;misused the
platform\&rdquo; by making fake accounts. Not by actively working against
the company\&rsquo;s alleged values around diversity. Or by making racists
more racist and fascists feel like they\&rsquo;re so validated that stabbing
immigrants to death or mowing anti-racism protesters down with a car
is not just a good idea, but <em>the right thing to do.</em></p>
<p>Facebook said, \&rdquo;... we are exploring several new improvements to our
systems for keeping inauthentic accounts and activity off our
platform. [...] Cool, so as long as the real accounts of people at
Russian or any other propaganda factories are the ones running ads,
it\&rsquo;s all good? [...]</p>
<p>Facebook could tell us more about what was in those ads and when --
like if both the domestic Trump campaign, and the Russian Trump
campaign were coordinated in messaging -- but it won\&rsquo;t. It could
also tell us who was targeted with what, where, and when, but it
hasn\&rsquo;t.</p>
