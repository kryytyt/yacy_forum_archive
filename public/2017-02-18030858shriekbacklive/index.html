should contribute to this because I very much want to be able to see
Shriekback live again,
thx.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Releasing Shriekback as a live animal after a quarter century of
strictly studio-based captivity is no small thing. To deliver what we
want to give and, more importantly, what you want and deserve to hear
and see, no corners can be cut. If we say so ourselves, we have a huge
amount of material that means a lot to a lot of people and, on stage,
we have a lot of history and expectation to live up to. For years now
we\&rsquo;ve fielded requests to play live again, but for various reasons,
whether financial or related to the availability of the core members,
the ducks haven\&rsquo;t been in a row: now they are. With some help from
you, of course.</p>
<p>Since Barry, Martyn and myself have re-established our relationship in
the studio -- and found it as thrilling as ever -- it seems the
right time to put that chemistry back on the road. But unlike the
world of recording, where technology has made everything cheaper,
smaller and faster, the stage lights are as cruel and unblinking as
ever and the journey into the glare even longer and more expensive.
So, without further shoe-shuffling, this is what we need.</p>
<p>The band will need to deliver all the force and nuance of a very
diverse catalogue. We have lined up (ahem) an 8-piece unit that we
know can hit every mark. Martyn, Barry and myself will be entwined
with Steve Halliwell on guitar and keyboards and Mike Cozzi on guitar,
with the Partridge sisters, Wendy and Sarah, on vocals. As Barry
explained in the video, we can\&rsquo;t give you Dave Allen, but we\&rsquo;re
delighted to announce that we\&rsquo;ll be joined by Scott Firth on bass -
Scott comes to us from P.i.L and has played with Martyn extensively on
other projects, so we know we know The Groove will be just fine.</p>
<p>Eight people means a lot of equipment, rehearsal, transportation,
accommodation and everything else -- but if we\&rsquo;re doing this we\&rsquo;re
doing it right and we\&rsquo;re doing it big. Setting this up, getting it
rolling from a standing start, is by far the biggest ask of this
appeal. Once the machine is built and fired up we can take it anywhere
- and you will very much have a say in where that might be. Given the
cost and effort of the start-up, we are committed to touring for a
year from when we roll; this, we believe, will give us the opportunity
to visit you all, wherever you are.</p>
