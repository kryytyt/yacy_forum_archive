<p>I didn\&rsquo;t think much of this series, but I do have a few things to say
about it...</p>

<p>First of all, the Raven Hotel was awesome, a great sidekick, and the
best character in the story. And also the only character I was even
slightly sympathetic toward. I want to watch a show that is just about
Overly Attached Hotel Boyfriend. Maybe with Oswald Cobblepot as the
<a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2015/06/oswald/">bartender</a>. (I understand
that in the book, the hotel was Hendrix instead of Poe. That sounds
dumb.)</p>

<p>So that was my favorite part. Moving on:</p>

<p>(And by the way, I never read the book, because from the way people
talked about it I assumed it was going to be to <em>Neuromancer</em> what
<em>Sword of Shannara</em> was to <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. So I\&rsquo;m not comparing
the two.)</p>

<p>Ok, so you\&rsquo;ve been asleep for three hundred years, you wake up, and
literally the only thing that has changed is that you need to update
your ad blocker settings!</p>

<p>Now, I can imagine how, in this world, maybe the fact that there are a
hundred immortal billionaires who control the world while everyone else
lives in poverty might have had the effect of completely halting all
advancement in technology, and even all changes in
<a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2018/02/gucci-fall-2018-ready-to-wear/">fashion</a>.
But if that\&rsquo;s the case then <em>that\&rsquo;s what your story is about</em> and you
need to at least address it!</p>

<p>Come on!</p>

<p>Next, the way they do \&ldquo;prison\&rdquo; in this story didn\&rsquo;t make sense when
they did it in <em>Demolition Man</em> and it doesn\&rsquo;t make sense here. You\&rsquo;ve
sentenced a killer to hundreds of years in jail, but for them no
subjective time passes! There are only two things prison can nominally
be for: punishment or rehabilitation. This is neither. It\&rsquo;s not even
<em>exile,</em> because remember, the people who put him in prison are
immortal.</p>

<p>Also this was not eight episodes of story. So much padding. Almost the
entire last episode could have been cut. Guys, if you only have four
hours of story, <em>that\&rsquo;s ok.</em></p>

<p>Dichen Lachman is great, but I still didn\&rsquo;t give a crap about her
character, and the \&ldquo;big reveal\&rdquo; of who the villain was had no mystery
to it. They set up the show as a detective story or a mystery and then
there was no detecting, or mystery.</p>

<p>A trenchcoat is not a detective.</p>

<p>Graphic design is not worldbuilding.</p>

<p>Then they popped a Max Headroom cameo on us. Ok, ok, yes, I was all-in
on that. You showed me the thing and I recognized the thing. I am not
immune to nostalgia.</p>

<p>But then!</p>

<p>Instead of streaming it from Netflix, I downloaded torrents of this
show, and one of the side-effects of that is that my only option for
subtitles was all-or-nothing: the files I had didn\&rsquo;t have a track for
\&ldquo;only subtitle the scenes that are not in English\&ldquo;, of which there are
quite a few. So I ended up watching it with subtitles on all the time
(which I always find distracting and annoying, because I read ahead of
the voices). And that resulted in this...</p>

<p>There\&rsquo;s a big dumb cyber-ninja fight scene, and the music over it is a
cover of White Zombie\&rsquo;s 1995 hit, <em>More Human Than Human</em>. And it was
subtitled. So I\&rsquo;m pulled completely out of the story, such as it is,
because I\&rsquo;m watching cyber-ninjas fight while I\&rsquo;m reading the lyrics
to a twenty-three year old song referencing <em>Blade Runner,</em> which was
already thirteen years old when the original song came out -- in a TV
show that owes literally absolutely everything to <em>Blade Runner</em> and
<em>Neuromancer.</em></p>

<p>It\&rsquo;s almost enough to remind you that this show, based on a sixteen
year old book, is a re-tread of ideas that were done better almost four
decades ago.</p>

<p>And as the rat\&rsquo;s milk returns to the sewer, the cycle of life is
complete.</p>
