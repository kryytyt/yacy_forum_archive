Fight Against Fake News Was Undercut by Fear of Conservative
Backlash</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to two sources with direct knowledge of the company\&rsquo;s
decision-making, Facebook executives conducted a wide-ranging review
of products and policies earlier this year, with the goal of
eliminating any appearance of political bias. One source said
high-ranking officials were briefed on a planned News Feed update that
would have identified fake or hoax news stories, but
disproportionately impacted right-wing news sites by downgrading or
removing that content from people\&rsquo;s feeds. According to the source,
the update was shelved and never released to the public. It\&rsquo;s unclear
if the update had other deficiencies that caused it to be scrubbed.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;They absolutely have the tools to shut down fake news,\&rdquo; said the
source, who asked to remain anonymous citing fear of retribution from
the company. The source added, \&ldquo;there was a lot of fear about
upsetting conservatives after Trending Topics,\&rdquo; and that \&ldquo;a lot of
product decisions got caught up in that.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>\&ldquo;The strength of our community depends on authentic communication.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>\&ldquo;The news would be true if you people would just play nice.\&rdquo;</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The feedback we\&rsquo;ve gotten tells us that authentic stories are the
ones that resonate most.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>\&ldquo;Users tell us that things that they think are true make them
happy.\&rdquo;</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;We rely heavily on the community to report content.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>\&ldquo;We in the petrochemical industry rely heavily on the community to
report toxic spills.\&rdquo;</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a Facebook post published after the election, former Facebook
product designer Bobby Goodlatte blamed the social network for
boosting the visibility of \&ldquo;highly partisan, fact-light media,\&rdquo; and
for not taking bigger steps to combat the spread of fake news in the
lead-up to the election. \&ldquo;A bias towards truth isn\&rsquo;t an impossible
goal for News Feed,\&rdquo; he wrote. \&ldquo;But it\&rsquo;s now clear that democracy
suffers if our news feeds incentivize bullshit.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook influenced
the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea.\&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don\&rsquo;t know how Facebook thinks -- who could? But it might be
something like this: The real engagement drivers are fun videos, viral
things about human cultural identities, the world\&rsquo;s largest banana
splits, racist things, boobs, and things about aliens. Everyone is
upset today that Macedonian teenagers searching for a quick buck wrote
that Hillary Clinton had an FBI employee murdered. But what about
tomorrow? Let\&rsquo;s say you blocked all the publishers from Macedonia.
Are you also going to take away the articles that say that healing
crystals can lower blood pressure? What about if CBS Sunday Morning
does a piece about angels? [...]</p>

<p>For Mark Zuckerberg to say that less than 1% of news on Facebook is a
hoax is a little like saying that less than 1% of your brain is
malignant cancer. It\&rsquo;s not the 1% but the malignancy. It sounds like
things are 99% okay, but it\&rsquo;s actually a very bad diagnosis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is your irregularly-scheduled reminder:</p>

<p>If you work for Facebook, quit. It is morally indefensible for you to
use your skills to make that company more powerful. By working there,
you are making the world an objectively worse place. I\&rsquo;m sure you can
find a job working for a company that you don\&rsquo;t have to <em>apologize</em> for
all the time.</p>

<p>You can <em>do it.</em> I <em>believe</em> in you.</p>
