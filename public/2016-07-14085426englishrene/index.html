<p>Thank you for your patient and detailed reply and testing.<br />
<br />
Your comment on potential problems reading the Solr files, flags a
recurring problem / issue<br />
I/we have seen this problem, before, in the 1.<sup>83</sup>&frasl;<sub>9857</sub> +related
generations.<br />
This is seen, notably, when we need to move DATA sets to a fresh,
certified, public build #.<br />
This happens most frequently when the move becomes urgently needed.<br />
This happens when /ConfigHeuristics_p.html is suddenly unavailable, and
shows Solr error mssages, due to a breakdown in the surrounding
machine.<br />
Typically it is in the Heuristics page that we see this failure, and
when it fails, it produces what seems to be a non-recoverable error.<br />
<br />
Following instructions from Orbiter, some years ago, for this specific
type of case, we have relied on moving DATA sets to fresh, healthy
installs.<br />
This has not always been successful, to say the least.<br />
We have lost access to DATA sets.<br />
Our DATA sets are frequently on the order of 20+ GB or more.<br />
<br />
Despite carefully recovering and patiently moving them, we frequently we
have huge trouble getting the moved DATA pack to be read, at all.<br />
This is shown in the new \&lsquo;fresh build\&rsquo; vm refusing to start.<br />
Removing the DATA set and letting the new vm build a new empty DATA set,
shows the vm is comparatively healthy.<br />
Stopping it, properly, removing the \&lsquo;fresh\&rsquo; empty DATA set and
replacing it with our DATA set, and restarting - even in
\&lsquo;administrator\&rsquo; mode in the Win version, generates a \&lsquo;no start\&rsquo;
reaction.<br />
I have struggled with this in both Ubuntu installs for 3+ years and more
recently in Windows installs.<br />
<br />
I am wondering about the UTF- 8 issue.<br />
I may be totally wrong, of course.<br />
Our focused crawls are done in up to 40 languages. Our DATA sets are, of
necessity, heavily loaded with many languages and types of characters.<br />
By looking at front end search result \&lsquo;symptoms,\&rsquo; this may give us a
clue to the / or an / underlying problem.<br />
Users need to search from the front end in any of the source languages,
of course.<br />
<br />
I have noticed, also, that sometimes when a front end search is done
specifically in Ukrainian or Russian (for example) the results are very
limited, even though there has been a lot of suitable original data
mined and cross indexed, previously.<br />
Results in Ukrainian are smaller than Russian results and sometimes only
a few pages of results display.<br />
The front end search, using a built in generic display panel, tends to
go back to Page 1 - even when a Page 3 or Page 4 is selected to be
displayed next.<br />
This happens also when we know that there is substantial \&lsquo;extra\&rsquo; data
results that can be displayed.<br />
The numbers of potential results shown at the top of the results page
also seems smaller than should be available.<br />
Reverting to Page 1 happens in cases where we know there is more data
and larger available results are shown to be available.<br />
<br />
Can this create a weakness in the later readability of DATA sets that
have been moved to a fresh vm?<br />
If \&lsquo;yes,\&rsquo; how can this be \&lsquo;strengthened\&rsquo; to make the DATA sets more
reliably readable, when moved?<br />
<br />
I appreciate your thoughts on this, please.<br />
As noted above, I may be totally off base in this examination, but some
of the impacts could - perhaps - be as we are seeing them.<br />
<br />
Thank you very kindly, once again, for your patient help!<br />
Your seasoned expertise is most appreciated
