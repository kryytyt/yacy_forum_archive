law, the system must remain intricate, thorny, and all but
impenetrable.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;I get e-mails even from police saying, \&lsquo;Can you type in the serial
number and tell me who the gun is registered to?\&rsquo; Every week. They
think it\&rsquo;s like a VIN on a car. Even police. Police from everywhere.
\&lsquo;Hey, can you guys hurry up and type that number in?\&rsquo;\&rdquo; [...]</p>

<p>That\&rsquo;s been a federal law, thanks to the NRA, since 1986: No
searchable database of America\&rsquo;s gun owners. So people here have to
use paper, sort through enormous stacks of forms and record books that
gun stores are required to keep and to eventually turn over to the
feds when requested. It\&rsquo;s kind of like a library in the old days --
but without the card catalog. They can use pictures of paper, like
microfilm (they recently got the go-ahead to convert the microfilm to
PDFs), as long as the pictures of paper are not searchable. You have
to flip through and read. No searching by gun owner. No searching by
name.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;You want to see the loading dock?\&rdquo; We head down a corridor lined
with boxes. Every corridor in the whole place is lined with boxes,
boxes up to the eyeballs. In the loading dock, there\&rsquo;s a forklift
beeping, bringing in more boxes. [...] Almost 2 million new gun
records every month he has to figure out what to do with. Almost 2
million slips of paper that record the sale of a gun -- who bought it
and where -- like a glorified receipt. If you take pictures of the
gun records, you can save space. [...]</p>

<p>\&ldquo;These were Hurricane Katrina,\&rdquo; he says, leaning against a stack.
\&ldquo;They were all submerged. They came in wet. And then we dried them in
the parking lot. When they got dry enough, the ladies ran them into
the imager.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;Do you want to see the imagers? I\&rsquo;ll show you. Imaging is like
running a copy machine. So, like, if there\&rsquo;s staples? So what these
ladies along here do, from this wall to this wall, from six in the
morning until midnight... staples.\&rdquo; [...]</p>

<p>The vast majority of the gun records linking a gun to its owner are
kept back at the various licensed dealers, the Walmarts, Bob\&rsquo;s Gun
Shops, and Guns R Us stores dotting America\&rsquo;s landscape.</p>

<p>We have more gun retailers in America than we do supermarkets, more
than 55,000 of them. We\&rsquo;re talking nearly four times the number of
McDonald\&rsquo;s. Nobody knows how many guns that equals, but in 2013, U.S.
gun manufacturers rolled out 10,844,792 guns, and we imported an
additional 5,539,539. The numbers were equally astounding the year
before, and the year before that, and the year before that. [...]</p>

<p>Serial numbers, it turns out, are tangled clogs of hell. Half the time
what the cop is reading you is the patent number, not the serial
number, or it\&rsquo;s the ID of the importer, and then you have the \&ldquo;zero
versus letter O\&rdquo; problem, the \&ldquo;numeral 1 versus letter l versus
letter small-cap I\&rdquo; problem, and then there is the matter of all the
guns with duplicate serial numbers [...]</p>

<p>Step Two: Hester calls the manufacturer (if it\&rsquo;s a U.S.-made gun) or
the importer (for foreign-made guns). He wants to know which
wholesaler the gunmaker sold the weapon to. [...]</p>

<p>Step Three: You call the wholesaler and say, \&ldquo;Who did you sell it
to?\&rdquo; The wholesaler, who also has to keep such records, goes through
the same rigmarole the importer or manufacturer did, and he gives you
the name of the gun store that ordered it from him. Let\&rsquo;s say it was
Walmart.</p>

<p>Step Four: If the Walmart is still in business, you call it. The
actual store. Not corporate headquarters, or some warehouse, but the
actual Walmart in Omaha or Miami or Wheeling. You call that store and
you say, \&ldquo;To whom did you sell this Taurus PT 92 with this particular
serial number on it?\&rdquo; By law, every gun dealer in America has to keep
a \&ldquo;bound book\&rdquo; or an \&ldquo;orderly arrangement of loose-leaf pages\&rdquo;
(some have been known to use toilet paper in protest) to record every
firearm\&rsquo;s manufacturer or importer, model, serial number, type,
caliber or gauge, date received, date of sale. This record corresponds
to the store\&rsquo;s stack of 4473s, which some clerk has to go dig through
in order to read you the information from the form. Or he can fax it.
Congratulations. You have found your gun owner. [...]</p>

<p>There is no other place in America where technological advances are
against the law. Unless you count the Amish. Even if a gun store that
has gone out of business hands over records that it had kept on
computer files, Charlie can\&rsquo;t use them. He has to have the files
printed out, and then the ladies take pictures of them and store them
that way. Anything that allows people to search by name is verboten.</p>
