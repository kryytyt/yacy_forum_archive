<p>Date: 2015-06-17 13:10:42</p>
<p>I\&rsquo;m currently running the latest 1.<sup>83</sup>&frasl;<sub>9258</sub> for my long-term stability
test and I have to say it\&rsquo;s a disaster. I had a look at the peers list
from [Network.html]{style=&ldquo;font-style: italic&rdquo;} and checked for which
release versions are deployed by users and get a picture of the
distribution. As it stands, the most of the peers run some older
development version (or \&ldquo;unstable\&ldquo;) of YaCy, a few tens run the latest
one (9258), and very few peers run an old stable release.<br />
<br />
With these numbers, you\&rsquo;d think you could enable automatic updates for
any newest dev version available and \&ldquo;blend-in\&rdquo; along with the other
peers in the network which also run the latest release; this is to say,
there would be enough eyeballs ready to spot bugs on such bleeding-edge
releases that you could hide safely behind such a group of potential bug
reporters and let bugs be identified and fixed in a matter of days, and
then the fixes would quickly enter the next dev release and be
automatically installed by the updater. This at least was my thought.<br />
<br />
As it really stands, despite dozens of other users running my same
version, I still had to
<a href="http://mantis.tokeek.de/view_all_bug_page.php">report</a>{.postlink} two
severe major bugs which hamper the basic functioning of YaCy. The
interesting fact is that despite all the bugs, defects, and possible
improvements that I keep seeing around YacY, and all the many users
which probably notice the same, only few people take their own time to
report these on the bug tracker, thus making
[mantis.tokeek.de]{style=&ldquo;font-style: italic&rdquo;} the lonely desert that it
is.<br />
<br />
As I understand, the best option for keeping a stable, long-term YaCy
node seems to only install stable releases and avoid untested and
neglected dev intermediate versions. I think that releases identified as
stable would be free from such major oversights. The downside is of
course that new features and many minor bugs affecting stable releases
won\&rsquo;t enter the next stable release until it\&rsquo;s released, which could
be several months.<br />
<br />
I would like to understand what are your needs with YaCy, which
deployment cycle have you chosen, and how much you are/will be
dependable upon correct functioning of this engine.</p>
