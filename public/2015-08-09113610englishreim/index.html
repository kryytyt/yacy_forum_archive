Hi biolizard89\
\
\
I think, your concept of distributing ranking-algorithms, rather than
exchanging data itselves (with all their privacy- and spam- concerns),
might open a new door to look for alternative types of solutions
aiming for the improvement of ranking-algorithms \...
![:?](http://forum.yacy-websuche.de/images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif "Confused")\
\
\
Trying to bring things, thoughts, knowledge and discussion together:\
\
A fully centralized approach is the domain of commercial SE\'s. It
doesn\'t care much of privacy, but it supports best BIG-DATA anylytics
in order to develop \'most-optimal\' rankings in terms of customer
satisfaction and commercial interests.\
\
A \'cooperative approach\' relying on centralized data, resulted in a
crucial loss of privacy - or, in an increased risk of getting spammed
and tampered with disinforming data, respectively. Obviously, we
don\'t see any great solutions coming for that.\
\
A \'cooperative approach\', based on social graphs and using a
restricted data exchange, might bring most of needs for privacy and
data-secuity into balance. However, it is yet to be operationalized
fully.\
\
A pure algorithmic approach - this idea came up for me, when thinking
about your concept of exchanging algorhithms - could provide all
intelligence locally. It would not be restricted to influence
processes at query-time, but it also might influence an (local?)
index, by trying to avoid fetching and indexing false-positive hits.
Ranking algoritms might be choosen explicitely by the user, or elected
(or even trained) by the local search- & find- history. In such a
scenario, the development focus shifted towards the competition of
exchangeable \'intelligent\' algorithm plugins - avoiding to get stuck
with ambiguities of clustering, disinformation, and privacy, which can
be considered typical side-effects of centralized data-store
analytics.\
\
The approaches mentioned last, might make use of YaCy\'s query-log,
and be realized on the browser\'s side by \"Greasemonkey\" (or sthg.
similar, however, restricting it\'s use to firefox and chrome by now),
and on some logic preserved by the server.\
\
\
Did you miss some relevant views/issues/points within this try of a
review?\

<br />
This is an accurate summary, I think. Two additional things that I think
are noteworthy.<br />
<br />
(1) A somewhat large data set is necessary to avoid fitting the ranking
algorithm to noise rather than signal (called \&ldquo;overfitting\&rdquo; in machine
learning). If you have a small number of searches to train against, or a
large number that are all similar in some (potentially non-obvious) way,
then the algorithm you end up with is unlikely to perform well against
different searches. In my initial experiment, I trained against the top
100 results from 300 Google searches (selected at random from the AOL
dataset), using a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm took about 6
generations before it started overfitting. Changing various parameters
of the genetic algorithm might improve this, but I suspect a larger
sample size of training data would also be helpful. (To be fair, before
it started overfitting, it had closed about a quarter of the gap between
YaCy and DuckDuckGo, so it was still quite good for a first attempt.)<br />
<br />
(2) However, the large data set doesn\&rsquo;t have to be all on one user\&rsquo;s
computer. Based on a (relatively contrived) simulation I did where I
divided the dataset into 8 parts, put each one on a separate node, and
had the nodes exchange a linear combination of fitness values according
to a simulated social graph, the genetic algorithm reached nearly the
same fitness as the single-user version. It took about 4 times as many
generations to do so, although the number of runs was small enough and
the simulated social graph contrived enough that it\&rsquo;s not at all clear
whether a 4-fold increase will be representative of other cases. Even
so, 4-fold increase in number of generations isn\&rsquo;t a bad tradeoff for
the better sample size and better privacy you get by exchanging only
fitness values over a social graph.<br />
<br />
Another thing that could be done on the single-user side, maybe, is some
kind of custom link graph weighting based on the user\&rsquo;s browsing
habits. It\&rsquo;s not particularly hard for a Greasemonkey script to keep
track of which web pages a user visits, and that data could be combined
with YaCy\&rsquo;s link graph to estimate the user\&rsquo;s likely interest in
results. For example, a search result which has a large number of degree
2 or 3 link graph paths from domains that you visit, may be inferred to
be more relevant to you than one that only has a small number of degree
5 or 6 link graph paths from domains that you visit. Graph theory is not
really my thing, so I\&rsquo;m not sure how well this would work, but I think
it\&rsquo;s a logical extension of how Google does some of its ranking. I
might play around with it later to see how well it ends up working.</p>
