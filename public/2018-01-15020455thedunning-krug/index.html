am at something of a loss for snark
here</a>.
I want to believe that this is fiction, like some early 90s <em>Mondo 2000</em>
cover story documenting some made-up movement with a photo of some
creepy-assed Cap\&lsquo;n Crunch lookalike in fun-fur. But I suspect it\&rsquo;s
not.</p>
<p>There\&rsquo;s just too much to quote here, so I\&rsquo;ve bolded my favorites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There\&rsquo;s an actual house called the Crypto Castle, and the king is
Jeremy Gardner, 25, a rakish young investor with a hedge fund who has
become the de facto tour guide for crypto newcomers.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;I do I.C.O.s. It\&rsquo;s my thing,\&rdquo; he said. He wore a pink button-front
and pink pants. <strong>\&ldquo;It\&rsquo;s me, a couple V.C.s and a lot of
charlatans.\&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>About eight people live in the Crypto Castle on any given night, and
some of Mr. Gardner\&rsquo;s tenants brought out snacks (Cheez-Its and a jar
of Nutella). One of the bedrooms has a stripper pole. Mr. Gardner
leaned back into the sofa and rested his feet on the table. <strong>He
recently did an I.C.O. for a start-up after-party.</strong> \&ldquo;You can I.C.O.
anything,\&rdquo; he said. He runs Distributed, a 180-page magazine about
cryptocurrency that comes out about once a year. He is now raising
\$75 million for his hedge fund, Ausum Ventures (pronounced
\&ldquo;awesome\&ldquo;). He said his closest friends are <strong>moving to Puerto Rico
to get around paying taxes.</strong></p>
<p>\&ldquo;They\&rsquo;re going to build a modern-day Atlantis out there,\&rdquo; he said.
\&ldquo;But for me, it\&rsquo;s too early in my career to check out.\&rdquo; [...]</p>
<p><strong>\&ldquo;My neurons are fried from all the volatility,\&rdquo;</strong> Mr. Hummer said.
\&ldquo;I don\&rsquo;t even care at this point. I\&rsquo;m numb to it. I\&rsquo;ll lose a
million dollars in a day and I\&rsquo;m like, O.K.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>His room is simple: a bed, a futon, a TV on a mostly empty media
console, three keyboard cleaning sprays and a half dozen canisters of
Lysol wipes. His T-shirt read, \&lsquo;The Lizard of Wall Street,\&rsquo; with a
picture of a lizard in a suit, dollar-sign necklaces around its neck.
He carries with him a coin that reads, \&ldquo;memento mori,\&rdquo; to remind
himself he can die any day. <strong>He sees the boom as part of a global
apocalypse.</strong></p>
<p>\&ldquo;The worse regular civilization does and the less you trust, the
better crypto does,\&rdquo; Mr. Hummer said. \&ldquo;It\&rsquo;s almost like the
ultimate short trade.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hummer went out to meet Joe Buttram, 27, for drinks. As a mixed
martial arts fighter, Mr. Buttram said he would fight for a couple
hundred bucks, sometimes a few thousand, and worked security at a
start-up, but <strong>his main hobbies were reading 4chan and buying vintage
pornography, passions that exposed him to cryptocurrency.</strong> [...]</p>
<p>They talk about buying Lamborghinis, the single acceptable way to
spend money in the Ethereum cryptocurrency community. The currency\&rsquo;s
founder frequently appears in ((fan art as Jesus with a Lamborghini.
<strong>Mr. Buttram says he\&rsquo;s renting an orange Lambo for the weekend.</strong>
And he wears a solid gold Bitcoin \&ldquo;B\&rdquo; necklace encrusted with
diamonds that he had made. [...]</p>
<p>\&ldquo;When I meet people in the normal world now, I get bored,\&rdquo; Mr.
Hummer said. \&ldquo;It\&rsquo;s just a different level of consciousness.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone turns somber. \&ldquo;Sometimes I think about what would happen to
the future if a bomb went off at one of our meetings,\&rdquo; Mr. Buttram
said. Mr. Hummer said, <strong>\&ldquo;A bomb would set back civilization for
years.\&rdquo;</strong> [...]</p>
<p>As the holiday party filled up, a cryptocurrency rapper called
CoinDaddy -- Arya Bahmanyar, 28 -- was getting ready to perform.
Formerly a commercial real estate agent, Mr. Bahmanyar works full time
at CoinDaddy after becoming a self-described crypto-millionaire (\&ldquo;you
think I would dress up like this if I wasn\&rsquo;t?\&ldquo;). <strong>\&ldquo;Right now all
our entertainers come from outside crypto culture</strong> -- not inside
crypto, and we\&rsquo;ve got to change that,\&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He pointed to his outfit -- a long white fake mink coat, gold-heeled
shoes -- and said, \&ldquo;It\&rsquo;s gold, right? It\&rsquo;s gold. It\&rsquo;s a niche,
and I\&rsquo;m going to fill it.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(So that you don\&rsquo;t have to, I clicked on some of his YouTube clips. Not
even funny enough to share.)</p>
