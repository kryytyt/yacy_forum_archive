<p><a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/history/so-a-nazi-walks-into-an-iron-bar-the-meyer-lansky-story"><img src="https://www.jwz.org/images/meyer-lansky-1038x576.jpg" alt="" />Great Moments
in Nazi
Punching:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The German American Bund was formed in 1936 to promote the causes of
Nazi Germany in the United States. It was open to Americans of German
descent, provided they could prove they had no black or Jewish
ancestry. These guys were openly Nazis, like, not even the kind who
think they can hide behind fake irony and shitty frog memes. Their
flag was a swastika shooting out of an iron cross. So: fuck these guys
entirely. [...] They dissolved shortly after Pearl Harbor, when
being openly a Nazi temporarily went out of style in the US, and
everyone tried to pretend there hadn\&rsquo;t been a 25,000 member
organization of Americans dedicated to helping Hitler win.</p>

<p>The German-American Bund had a lot of meetings in areas with high
immigrant (read: Jewish) populations. One of those places was New York
City. Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia affirmed that Nazis were allowed to
meet, and were entitled to police protection, but he made sure the
cops guarding their meetings were mostly black or Jewish. So that
was... passive aggressive. But then there was another local political
figure: Judge Nathan D. Perlman.</p>

<p>Judge Perlman, who was -- no shit -- Jewish, did not care for Nazis.
This led him to reach out to one of the most powerful Jewish guys
around: Meyer Lansky. Judge Perlman, as you might expect, hadn\&rsquo;t done
Meyer any favors in the past. He had for example helped to end
Prohibition, the repeal of which, while generally extremely popular,
wasn\&rsquo;t great for the Meyer Lanskys of the world, who had been making
bank off illegal booze. But when Perlman met with Meyer after the rise
of the German American Bund, they ended up getting along pretty well.
Perlman was like \&ldquo;I want you to disrupt meetings of Nazis\&rdquo; and Meyer
was like \&ldquo;excellent, on it,\&rdquo; and Perlman was like \&ldquo;hang on I\&rsquo;m not
finished\&rdquo; and Meyer was like \&ldquo;sorry\&rdquo; and Perlman was like \&ldquo;I will
pay you and give you legal assistance, should anyone get arrested. The
only condition is, don\&rsquo;t kill anyone.\&rdquo; With what I can only imagine
to be the world\&rsquo;s greatest eye roll, Meyer said \&ldquo;Ugh fine, I won\&rsquo;t
kill anyone. Also, I don\&rsquo;t want your money.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he went to work. [...]</p>

<p>These attacks went on for over a year. Journalist Walter Winchell
would praise the attacks from the air, and pass on information to
Meyer about where and when the Nazis would be meeting. Life got pretty
dangerous for Nazis in New York City.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel also TRAINED other
people to fight Nazis, which, come on, can you just imagine Meyer
Lansky and Bugsy Siegel training young antifa in the early 30s? I love
it. I\&rsquo;m picturing a lot of newsboy caps and comments like \&ldquo;no no not
like that, my bubbe (ofblessedmemory) punches better than that, you
grip the brass knuckles like this.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>This also seems like a good time to mention that Lucky Luciano,
Meyer\&rsquo;s
definitely-not-boyfriend-I-don\&rsquo;t-know-why-you-would-think-that,
offered to send some of his guys to help with this, but Meyer told
him, \&ldquo;thanks, but no, this needs to be a Jewish fight.\&rdquo;</p>
