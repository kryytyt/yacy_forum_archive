Hosts Trump Inauguration Party With Fake News-Pushing Website The Daily
Caller:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Facebook may now profess to combat fake news, but that didn\&rsquo;t keep
the company from hosting a Trump inauguration soir√©e in DC along with
the Daily Caller, a far-right news website whose frequent
misinformation and lies keep fact-checking website Snopes rather busy.</p>

<p>I know! Who cares about being in cahoots with a publication that
celebrated Obama commuting the sentence of Chelsea Manning this week
with the headline \&ldquo;Genetic Male Bradley Manning Pulls Off The Klinger
Gambit,\&rdquo; right? Not me!</p>

<p>Not to be left out of the action, oil company BP was also a host. It
was, according to the publication, \&ldquo;A veritable who\&rsquo;s who of beltway
bigwigs\&rdquo; at the Hay-Adams Hotel in DC, all talking Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2017/01/19/mark-zuckerberg-sues-over-100.html">Mark Zuckerberg sues over 100 Hawaiians to force them to sell them
their ancestral
land:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2015, Mark Zuckerberg (who insists that privacy is dead) bought 100
acres of land around his vacation home in Hawaii to ensure that no one
could get close enough to spy on him.</p>

<p>The Zuckerberg estate on Kauai North Shore engulfs several smaller
pieces of land deeded in the 1800s -- kuleana lands that were granted
to native Hawaiians. The owners of this land are entitled to easements
through Zuckerberg\&rsquo;s property, so they can reach their own.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg has filed \&ldquo;quiet title\&rdquo; lawsuits to force the owners of
more than 100 of these parcels to sell to him. His lawyer says it\&rsquo;s
the easiest way to figure out who has title to these family lands so
he can make them an offer. Hey, when I want to find out who someone
is, I always sue \&lsquo;em.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-18/this-team-runs-mark-zuckerberg-s-facebook-page">Zuckerberg has a staff of twelve just to delete abusive comments on his
Facebook
page:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Typically, a handful of Facebook employees manage communications just
for him, helping write his posts and speeches, while an additional
dozen or so delete harassing comments and spam on his page, say two
people familiar with the matter. Facebook also has professional
photographers snap Zuckerberg, say, taking a run in Beijing or reading
to his daughter</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2016/10/19/mark-zuckerberg-defends-facebo.html">In an internal Facebook post, Zuckerberg defends his company\&rsquo;s ongoing
association with Peter Thiel -- Facebook investor/board member and
major donor to white-supremacist / pro-rape candidate Donald
Trump.</a></p>

<p>This is your irregularly-scheduled reminder:</p>

<p>If you work for Facebook, quit. It is morally indefensible for you to
use your skills to make that company more powerful. By working there,
you are making the world an objectively worse place. I\&rsquo;m sure you can
find a job working for a company that you don\&rsquo;t have to <em>apologize</em> for
all the time.</p>

<p>You can <em>do it</em>. I <em>believe</em> in you.</p>
