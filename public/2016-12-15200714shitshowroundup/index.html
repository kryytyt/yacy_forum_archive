Electors:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>With just days to go until the real election of 2016 -- the Electoral
College -- the rogue faction known as the Hamilton Electors is making
one last-ditch effort to save America from Donald Trump by denying him
the 270 votes he\&rsquo;ll need to be officially named president. [...]</p>

<p>\&ldquo;This isn\&rsquo;t about getting a Democrat in. This isn\&rsquo;t even about
getting a Republican in. This is about stopping Donald Trump,\&rdquo;
Chiafalo said. \&ldquo;This is about stopping the most unfit president we
would have ever had by far.\&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@nick_sharp/what-i-saw-at-the-michigan-recount-7c46fdc87243#.5oc80wq55">What I saw at the Michigan
recount:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>On December 7, 2016, I volunteered as an observer with Recount
Michigan 2016. I showed up at 9:00am sharp in the heart of Detroit, in
heavily democratic Wayne County, Michigan.</p>

<p>It was a bloodbath.</p>

<p>I did not count a single vote during my entire first four-hour shift.</p>

<p>Trump\&rsquo;s legal team was there in force, circling the room like sharks.
They were challenging everything, gumming up the works and
disqualifying whole precincts. I was only aware of a single Green
Party attorney plus one law student in my (large) room. Many
challenges had one or more Trump lawyers speaking with election
officials, and no legal advocate present for the other side; they were
simply outnumbered and outgunned.</p>

<p>Every recount table had 1 -- 2 Trump observers present, each one
holding written scripts to challenge every single precinct, regardless
of the facts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@bethmartinez/why-every-american-should-care-about-michigans-canceled-recount-3cacf201c0f7#.ebuy6awo4">Why Every American Should Care About Michigan\&rsquo;s Canceled
Recount:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As as the Michigan recount is being stalled in courts, it has become
clear that 75,000 votes in the counties with highly Democratic
populations came back with no vote for President -- but with votes
for candidates lower down the ballot. This is what is referred to as
an \&ldquo;undervote\&rdquo; and is largely attributed to malfunctioning ballot
reader machines. In a state that Trump won by 11,000 votes, this large
number of undervotes could easily change the outcome of who won here.</p>

<p>Incredibly, Michigan laws prohibit a recount if there are
discrepancies in reconciling the numbers of votes against the poll
books. Which is insane, of course. In a Catch 22 move, these wonky
recount laws disallow a recount for the very reasons that a recount
would be justified: \&ldquo;a precinct is ineligible to be recounted if the
\&lsquo;number of ballots to be recounted and the number of ballots issued
on election day as shown on the poll list or the computer printout do
not match and the difference is not explained to the satisfaction of
the board of canvassers.\&rsquo;\&rdquo; If someone wanted to skew an election,
all they would have to do is add or remove a few ballots so the poll
books don\&rsquo;t match the number of votes, and there can be no recount.</p>

<p>Most of the mismatched poll books are in Wayne County, a heavily
Democratic area with a population of over 1.7 million people.
According to Detroit\&rsquo;s election director, eighty-seven of Wayne
County\&rsquo;s decade-old voting machines broke on election day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-lost-popular-vote-hillary-clinton-us-election-president-history-a7470116.html">Donald Trump lost the popular vote in last month\&rsquo;s US presidential
election by a bigger margin than any other US president in
history.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Republican is currently trailing Democrat rival Hillary Clinton by
2.8 million votes as the last remaining postal ballots are counted --
despite him winning the November 8 election because of the Electoral
College system.</p>

<p>That deficit is more than five times bigger than the 544,000 by which
George W. Bush lost to Al Gore in 2000 - the second biggest popular
vote deficit in history for a candidate who has still gone on to
become President. [...]</p>

<p>In 2012 Mr Trump called the Electoral College \&ldquo;a disaster for
democracy\&rdquo; after mistakenly thinking it would lead to President Obama
losing the popular vote but retaining the White House.</p>

<p>Following his election victory, however, the billionaire businessman
praised the \&ldquo;genius\&rdquo; of the system.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html">CIA assessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win White
House:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia\&rsquo;s
goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get
elected,\&rdquo; said a senior U.S. official briefed on an intelligence
presentation made to U.S. senators. \&ldquo;That\&rsquo;s the consensus view.\&rdquo;
[...]</p>

<p>The Obama administration has been debating for months how to respond
to the alleged Russian intrusions, with White House officials
concerned about escalating tensions with Moscow and being accused of
trying to boost Clinton\&rsquo;s campaign.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/10/opinions/how-politicians-let-russia-hack-americas-election-waldman/">Mitch McConnell, whose wife was offered a cabinet position, covered it
up:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Post told of an extraordinary meeting on Capitol Hill in
mid-September, when FBI Director James Comey, Secretary of Homeland
Security Jeh Johnson and other officials met with the leadership of
both parties. They made the case for a bipartisan statement sending a
warning to Russia that such actions would not be tolerated.</p>

<p>But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put the kibosh on it.</p>

<p>So the White House backed down, apparently to avoid being seen as
trying to aid Clinton\&rsquo;s campaign. [...]</p>

<p>Confronted with an attack by a hostile foreign power on our most
critical institutions, Republicans decided that Russian hacking was
OK, as long as it was against Democrats -- indeed, as Wikileaks
strategically released the hacked emails over a period of weeks for
maximum political impact, Republicans celebrated. [...]</p>

<p>And Democrats, including Barack Obama, didn\&rsquo;t have the courage to
stand up to them.</p>

<p>We think of American democracy as the most stable and secure in the
world. But that stability and security comes not from the design of
the system, but from the integrity and fortitude of the people within
it. These new details, coming so late, are showing us that integrity
and fortitude were both in short supply.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://crooksandliars.com/2016/12/you-know-im-smart-person">Trump doesn\&rsquo;t need daily intelligence briefings because he\&rsquo;s
smart:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>\&ldquo;I\&rsquo;m, like, a smart person. I don\&rsquo;t have to be told the same thing
in the same words every single day for the next eight years. Could be
eight years. Could be eight years.\&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trump\&rsquo;s disinterest in keeping up-to-date on important security
information is the most profound abrogation of responsibility ever
exhibited by a person about to take command of our nuclear codes and
the combined might of our military.</p>

<p>Pence being given the PDB is not a sufficient replacement. No
President has ever turned over their Commander-in-Chief
responsibilities to their Vice President -- not without being dead or
completely incapacitated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/12/07/tillerson-might-be-the-worst-one-on-trumps-list/?utm_term=.dc430eadc00b">Tillerson might be the worst secretary of state contender on Trump\&rsquo;s
list:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Friends and associates said few U.S. citizens are closer to [Russian
President Vladimir] Putin than Mr. Tillerson, who has known Mr. Putin
since he represented Exxon\&rsquo;s interests in Russia during the regime of
Boris Yeltsin.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;He has had more interactive time with Vladimir Putin than probably
any other American with the exception of Henry Kissinger,\&rdquo; said John
Hamre, a former deputy defense secretary during the Clinton
administration and president of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a Washington think tank where Mr. Tillerson is
a board member.</p>

<p>In 2011, Mr. Tillerson struck a deal giving Exxon access to prized
Arctic resources in Russia as well as allowing Russia\&rsquo;s state oil
company, OAO Rosneft, to invest in Exxon concessions all over the
world. The following year, the Kremlin bestowed the country\&rsquo;s Order
of Friendship decoration on Mr. Tillerson. [...]</p>

<p>In short, the only person who would like this nomination would be --
you guessed it -- Putin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2016/12/rex_tillerson_secretary_of_state_what_s_good_for_exxon_is_bad_for_the_country.html">Rex Tillerson, secretary of state: What\&rsquo;s good for Exxon is bad for
the
country.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The nomination of Rex Tillerson as secretary of state is like
something out of a Marxist comic book: Who better to be the chief
diplomat of a neocolonial power, plundering the world\&rsquo;s oil riches,
than the chairman and CEO of the world\&rsquo;s largest oil company!
[...]</p>

<p>Exxon Mobil, on the other hand, doesn\&rsquo;t see itself as bound up with
the country at all. Rather, as Steve Coll, author of Private Empire:
ExxonMobil and American Power, recently wrote in the New Yorker, Exxon
Mobil sees itself as \&ldquo;a parallel quasi-state,\&rdquo; a \&ldquo;power independent
of the American government, one devoted firmly to shareholder
interests and possessed of its own foreign policy,\&rdquo; the goal of which
is \&ldquo;to promote a world that is good for oil and gas production.\&rdquo;</p>
