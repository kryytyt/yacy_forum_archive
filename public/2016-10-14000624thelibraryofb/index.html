<h1 id="the-library-of-babel">The Library of Babel</h1>

<p>Date: 2016-10-14 00:06:24</p>

<p>I was thinking about the Borges story <em>The Library of Babel</em> (which you
can read
<a href="http://www.arts.ucsb.edu/faculty/reese/classes/artistsbooks/The%20Library%20of%20Babel.pdf">here</a>,
and browse random books from
<a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/random.cgi">here</a>) l and I got to wondering
whether anyone had done any decent renderings of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an
indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with
vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings. From any of
the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and lower floors.
The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five
long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height,
which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of
a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway
which opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all
the rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two very
small closets. In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other,
satisfy one\&rsquo;s fecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral
stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances.
In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all
appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is
not infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to
dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite
... Light is provided by some spherical fruit which bear the name of
lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon. The light
they emit is insufficient, incessant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was disappointed to find that my go-to resource for such things, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Imaginary-Places-Updated-Expanded/dp/0156008726"><em>The
Dictionary of Imaginary
Places</em></a>,
had no illustration to go along with its entry.</p>

<p>However, I think there are several major misreadings here.</p>

<ol>
<li>The text pretty clearly states that there is only <em>one</em> door from
each hexagon to the hallway. To connect the hexagons as shown here
requires two or more doors per room.</li>
<li>There is one bookcase on each of 4 walls. Not multiple bookcases,
and not on 5 walls.</li>
<li>Each shelf of each bookcase contains 35 books of 410 pages. Even
assuming rather thick paper, each of those books would be less than
2\&rdquo; thick, yielding a bookcase less than 6\&rsquo; wide. So the rooms are
probably a lot smaller than shown.</li>
<li>The sleep chamber, lavatory and hallway aren\&rsquo;t shown.</li>
</ol>

<dl>
<dt>mistakes about the number of doors, and omits the hallways.</dt>

<p>But if Borges had meant a tower, I think he would have said a tower, and
probably would have used the word \&ldquo;floor\&rdquo; more often instead of words
like \&ldquo;region\&rdquo; and \&ldquo;circuit\&ldquo;, and wouldn\&rsquo;t have said, \&ldquo;If an
eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction...\&rdquo;</p>

<p>That does leave weirdly-shaped unreachable voids between the pods. But
at one point he speaks of \&ldquo;in a hexagon on circuit fifteen
ninety-four\&ldquo;, and the word \&ldquo;circuit\&rdquo; fits well with this circular
arrangement.</p>

<p>Various other illustrations of it that I\&rsquo;ve seen seemed to assume that
the sleep chamber and lavatory open off of the hallway, but \&ldquo;To the
left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets\&rdquo; sounds
to me like those closets are on the <em>same wall</em> as the entrance to the
hallway, that is, they open into the hexagonal room. So that gives us a
minimum length of each wall of about 10\&rsquo; (assuming pre-ADA, sub-OSHA
standards of construction). That means the bookcases can\&rsquo;t possibly
fill the whole wall unless there is a lot of empty space on them, or the
books themselves are each like 40\&rdquo; thick.</p>

<p>Where does the spiral staircase go? Again, a lot of illustrators stuck
it off of the hallway, but it doesn\&rsquo;t read that way to me. It sounds to
me like there is a spiral stairway within each of the hexagonal book
rooms. It <em>might</em> wrap around the air shaft, but I think that\&rsquo;s a
tortured interpretation.</p>

<p>I haven\&rsquo;t added the stairwells, and I kind of think the \&ldquo;corridors\&rdquo;
need to be longer to earn that word. Also those enormous and
oddly-shaped voids between \&ldquo;circuits\&rdquo; of rooms bother me. So I don\&rsquo;t
think this is quite right either.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel">Wikipedia says</a>
that there are 25^1,312,000^ or 1.956 × 10^1,834,097^ possible books.
That\&rsquo;s a lot of books.</p>

<p>with 700 books per room, and the rooms laid out with approximately the
same number of rooms on all three axes, I think that means it is roughly
10^611,364^ rooms wide and floors tall before you reach the end?</p>

<p>I can\&rsquo;t help but think about the weight and pressure of a column of air
that high, and what is it sitting on, and how to route the plumbing from
all of those toilets, and that toilets imply digestion, so where does
the food come from? Is there a section of the library devoted to
farming, and metallurgy? But now I\&rsquo;m overthinking a sub-infinite but
nearly boundless hill of beans.</p>
