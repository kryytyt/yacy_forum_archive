<p><a href="http://48hillsonline.org/2015/02/05/food-delivery-services-clogging-streets-blocking-traffic/"><img src="http://www.jwz.org/images/sf_bikelane_575px.gif" alt="" /></a>The
author wants to make this about tech-hate, but really it\&rsquo;s about SFPD
and SFMTA choosing to not enforce the law:</p>

<p><a href="http://48hillsonline.org/2015/02/05/food-delivery-services-clogging-streets-blocking-traffic/">Food delivery services are clogging the streets and blocking
traffic:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>On arteries like Valencia Street, a prime route for bicyclists, the
trend threatens to worsen what is already an obstacle course,
particularly during evening meal times. Many of the restaurants are
serial offenders that regularly leave delivery vehicles in bike lanes,
slowing everyone down as cyclists are forced into the traffic lane.</p>

<p>At Gajalee Indian Restaurant on Valencia, drivers picking up delivery
orders regularly block the bike lane. And with Gajalee\&rsquo;s new display
of \$5-off coupons for deliveries from GrubHub, it\&rsquo;s a problem
unlikely to improve anytime soon.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;I got four or five tickets from blocking the bike lane in the last
couple years,\&rdquo; Gajalee manager Kobi Mohan told us. \&ldquo;It\&rsquo;s a cost of
doing business for us.\&rdquo; [...]</p>

<p>Mohan said he\&rsquo;s been told the cars he uses for deliveries and
stocking his restaurant aren\&rsquo;t allowed to use the center lane to
parking temporarily and he\&rsquo;s been given no legal options, so he still
uses the bike lane and just hopes to avoid too many tickets.</p>

<p>\&ldquo;There\&rsquo;s nothing we can do,\&rdquo; he said, explaining that he needs
deliveries to make his business function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fuck you, Kobi Mohan. If your business is unsustainable, then you can
either, A) fix your business model to be profitable, or B) fail.
Declaring yourself a magical unicorn who doesn\&rsquo;t have to follow the
laws that other people do just makes you a <em>parasite.</em></p>

<p>You\&rsquo;re not even some dot-com whose VC has his hand up the Mayor\&rsquo;s ass
-- what makes you think you get to participate in this Libertarian
I-got-mine \&ldquo;disruption\&rdquo; con, too?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SFMTA spokesperson Paul Rose said the agency is aware of the problem
and trying to address it: \&ldquo;As SFMTA is made aware of a problem
area/location, SFMTA engineers are sent to the location to evaluate
parking management and options such as curbside marking/signage. SFMTA
Enforcement reaches out to the proprietor of a business and explains
the problem and identifies workable solutions. If all avenues have
been evaluated and addressed and there is no change, increased Parking
Control Officer presence will occur, until compliance is achieved.\&rdquo;
[...]</p>

<p>While big delivery companies such as UPS, FedEx, and even many beer
distributors have city permits that factor in the cost of blocked
lanes and specific rules for minimizing the disruption, food delivery
services mostly follow the tech industry\&rsquo;s disruption model of asking
for forgiveness later instead of official permission up front.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone know what these \&ldquo;special permits\&rdquo; that UPS and FedEx have
allow? I had always assumed that when UPS and FedEx park in the bike
lane -- and by \&ldquo;when\&rdquo; I mean \&ldquo;always\&rdquo; -- that they were straight
up breaking the law, with SFPD straight up refusing to enforce the law
on them.</p>

<p>If they are actually legally allowed to park there, I\&rsquo;ll be even more
enraged. Are they?</p>

<p>I hope this is just a confused and roundabout way of saying \&ldquo;vehicles
with commercial plates are allowed to use the \&lsquo;loading zone\&rsquo; spots
that exist on every non-residential block in the city.\&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In December, Mayor Ed Lee announced plans to crack down on drivers who
block traffic, and Rose told us the effort was aimed primarily at SoMa
and facilitating commuter traffic headed to the Bay Bridge, with a
half-dozen additional parking control officers deployed on Thursdays
and Friday to issue tickets for blocking traffic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A speedy commute back to the suburbs is the only priority. If you\&rsquo;re
not actually in a car, go fuck yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But SFMTA figures show relatively few citations for blocking bike
lanes compared with double-parking, even with December\&rsquo;s uptick in
citations for both. There were 2,391 double parking citation in
December, up from 2,036 in November; and 187 citations for blocking
bike lanes, up from just 132 a month earlier.</p>

<p>The San Francisco Bicycle Coalition has tried to highlight the issue
with its new <a href="https://www.sfbike.org/news/tag/parkingdirtysf/">#ParkingDirtySF
campaign</a>, urging
members to send in photos and information when they see someone
blocking a bike lane. It has compiled that information into a top 10
list of the worst corridors for blocked bike lanes. [...]</p>

<p>\&ldquo;People who double-park cars in bike lanes and crosswalks are not
just causing an inconvenience, they are jeopardizing people\&rsquo;s safety
as they bicycle and walk. Stepping up enforcement on this dangerous
activity should be an easy place for the Mayor and the SF Police
Department to send the message that safety is a priority on our
streets and to put action behind their Vision Zero commitments,\&rdquo; said
Leah Shahum, who is stepping down as SFBC\&rsquo;s executive director to go
study Vision Zero in Europe on a Marshall Memorial Fellowship this
spring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It\&rsquo;s the 21st Goddamned Century: why can\&rsquo;t I act like a human
red-light camera, take a phone-photo of the license plate of a car in
the bike lane, text it to 311, and have a ticket automatically issued
based on the timestamp and GPS? Yes, I will <em>gladly</em> click the checkbox
saying that I will testify to this in court if necessary.</p>
